I'm going through the backoffice front end trying to create JSON to show the data being simulated using the new hfj_analytics database, and a few things stand out:
1.  the UserAgent table lacks a datetime column (or a key to any table having such information), so any data displayed using that table will be for ALL UserAgent data going back to the beginning of data collection. Given the speed with which UserAgents change, I don't think that will be anywhere near as useful as displaying that data as it changes over time.  While it's true the front-end  ( http://tools.typography.com/demographics/ )seems to be showing data that way, Greg, Lauren, and I spoke of taking time into account in showing the data (in the absence of a historical graph, I was going to display user agent data for the past month or something  -- but that isn't possible with the current db design).
2. We discussed the difference between what Akamai delivers versus the bandwidth we charge for -- is this Al_BandwidthNotCached versus  Al_BandwidthCached ?  -- and is this the data to be displayed in the last graph and second-to-last graph on http://tools.typography.com/traffic/ ?  The second to last appears to be (in terms of calculus) the derivative of the data display in the last, though at a different scale, and using different terms.  I'm asking this because there really only seem to be four columns providing this information in the hfj_analytics db:  the two just mentioned along with Al_RequestsCached and Al_RequestsNotCached (which the demo backoffice doesn't seem to want to display at all).
3.  This brings up another question:  in the backoffice front end the traffic data display ( http://tools.typography.com/traffic/ ) hopes to distinguish data going to H&FJ from data going to subscribers, but I'm not seeing any support for that distinction in the hfj_anaytics database.  
4. Scott tells me we no longer have a notion of "Enterprise" -- so I'm working to eliminate mentions of it in the backoffice.
5. Last week I talked to Scott at length about distinguishing the various classes of users in terms of how much of their bandwidth they have used (whether they are reserve or non-reserve users and how much of their allotted bandwidth they have used both in reserve and "sub-reserve" -- that part of reserve-users' plans that are not reserve).  While it seems possible to glean this information from existing data (we have data about how much bandwidth a project has used in AnalyticsLogs, and I can lookup how much data a user has been allotted in developmentCloud3), calculating that information is a per-user thing and it's probably going to be expensive in terms of database number crunching.  It will probably be done by an infrequently-done job, and, since it is a core part of H&FJ business logic, Scott will probably be writing it. Such digests would end up in tables that the backoffice I am writing can lookup and display at http://tools.typography.com/demographics/ .   But as of last week those tables either didn't exist or were not being populated with data.
