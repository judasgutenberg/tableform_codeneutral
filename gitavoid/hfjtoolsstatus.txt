Status report on tools.typography.com, May 17 2012
Outstanding issues begin with *

System Health 
	http://tools.typography.com/system/
	
	The data on this page is all coming correctly from actual scripts.

Server Availability
	http://tools.typography.com/system/availability/
	
	The data on this page is all coming correctly from actual scripts, although the instance list is kind of large. Perhaps there should be a way to limit what ends up on this list.

Server Utilization
	http://tools.typography.com/system/utilization/
	
	The data on this page is all coming correctly from actual scripts, although there still needs to be some scripts installed and run on individual instances to monitor things like Disk Usage on EC2 instances.

Process Health Checks
	http://tools.typography.com/system/health/
	
	All the checks are written except for the following:
		*configure character set	
		*reset font	
		*duplicate font
		*copy settings	
		*check watermark in font	
		*outgoing messages are working	
		*hourly analytics processes are working	
		*nightly account check ran	
		*project thumbnail updates on domain change
		
	There is a provision for disabling a check so that it will not be run. Disabled checks show up as "D" in the tool. Unwritten checks show up as "N."  Checks that fail for lack of a prerequisite check (when this is knowable) show up as "I."  All others count as failures.  As always, process checks can be edited in this editor: http://tools.typography.com/tf/process_check_tool.php un/pwd: root/!speedboat

Transaction Failures
	http://tools.typography.com/system/transactions/

	Is correctly monitoring and tallying failures in the CdnRequests system.
	
Traffic
	http://tools.typography.com/traffic/
	
	Data is correct with the exception of:
	
	*Unattributed Bandwidth (still demo data)
	*DAILY BANDWIDTH DIFFERENCE VS. AKAMAI (Greg- you tell me there is some Akamai API I can use to determine the difference between compressed and uncompressed bandwidth).

Cloud Users
	http://tools.typography.com/users/
	
	This data is all correct, though:
	*there appears to be a bug in the front end code making it so that only some sectors are displayed in what should be fully-circular graphs.  (I could be wrong, but my testing from the backend is going nowhere.)

Demographics
	http://tools.typography.com/demographics/
	
	The data for Browser Complexion is correct (it currently shows data for the past month).  All other data is incomplete or demo:
	*Font Complexion:  I need some way to determine this from log data.  All I can do now is distinguish EOT from the rest.
	*BANDWIDTH USAGE (THIS MONTH) -- all of this is digest data that doesn't yet exist.  I can take a stab at writing the code to create these digests, though some of it depends on business logic that Scott is still writing.

Sales
	http://tools.typography.com/sales/
	 
	Only non-cloud data is non-demo. My understanding is that for:
	*cloud data, some of the underlying business logic is not complete.  Also, some of this depends on the CRM.
	(Also, data in devlopmentStore is quite stale, so nothing shows for "Sales Today")
