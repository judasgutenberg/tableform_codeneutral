Gus,

Generally things are looking good.  Real good.  I have a couple comments:

1.  can we make the calendar bigger.  Just the overall size being larger will help.

2. If I understand the Search function correctly, you have to Search under the specific Practioner>Search.  We need a general Search funtion for patients (by the way, for MedBoxx the word client should be replaced with "Patient") without the association of a practioner.  For instance, if the desk wants to search for a Patient's appointment and doesn't know which practioner the patient is seeing.

3.  When I tried to add a patient (myself) for an appointment with Dr. Parklington, once the patient is identifed, the fields of name and ID should be filled automatically.  If you type in the name incorrectly spelled, or don't put the ID in, you get a message saying "You didn't include." without saying what is needed.

4. An issue that will come up: Let's say I'm a Dr. and have a patient scheduled for an 11am appt for 1 hour.   During this hour I may want another patient scheduled for a quick appointment during this hour (going to another room) for a 15 min appt like suture removal.  Currently, no other appt can be scheduled during another scheduled appt--which makes sense but most offices have short appts squeezed around longer appts.  we need an option to schedule multiple appts (orthodontists sometimes schedule up to 4 patients simultaneously).  I'm not sure how to handle this graphically (maybe just additional vertical columns or drop-downs?).  Let me know your thoughts.

5.  On the patient registration at the subdomain, after saving we should have a pop up saying "Thank you for registering".  Also, remember the subdomain should have a "Welcome To Our Office" homepage similar to our jpg that we sent awhile ago.  That homepage would have a link sending the patient to registration.  If you want me to resend the jpg of the office homepage (not the medboxx homepage) let me know.

Thanks for all the hardwork, let's try to talk over the weekend briefly. What's a good time for you Sat or Sunday?--d
