But since tonight was to be our last in Paris, we decided to spend it back at the H&ocirc;tel Nesle. On the way over, we stopped for caf&eacute; at a brasserie near the Louvre.  A day or so ago I'd decided that I liked the ritual of drinking a tiny little shot of caf&eacute; at a brasserie bar. But since I was clearly an American, I had to be very clear to the bartender that I wanted a conventional French caf&eacute; and not  watered-down faux American coffee. I had to sympathize with him though; he's probably dealt with his fair share of idiotic American tourists who asked for one thing but expected something else.<br><dd>After checking in at the H&ocirc;tel Nesle, Gretchen and I split up.  She went off to a coffee shop to write post cards and I went to the <a href=http://www.smartweb.fr/orsay/ target=musee>Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay</a> to look at art. The Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay is housed in a converted train station and features a spectacular central atrium. The art housed within is from several wildly different eras, including both sides of the "19th Century Modernist Revolution." One gets a better sense of what there was for Impressionists to rebel against when one looks upon the gloomy Neo-Classical canvases typical of pre-Impressionist painting.<p><center> <font color=999999 size=-1> <img src="../europe0201/images/400_copiedcezanne.jpg" width="450" height="340" alt="" border="0"><br> A Cézanne being copied in the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay<p> <img src="../europe0201/images/420_catacombs_cross.jpg" width="300" height="413" alt="" border="0"><br> Funky designs made with bones in the Paris+Catacombs.<p> <p></font></center><p><dd>When I was done with the museum (it goes fast when you're doing it by yourself), Gretchen and I walked nearly all the way to the southern fringe of Paris in the 14th Arrondissement, stopping at a brasserie somewhere along the way for a conventional French lunch (I had the fish soup and a beer).  Our principle destination for today was the Paris+Catacombs, a large complex of subterranean building stone mines that were subsequently filled with the bones of some six or seven million Parisians.  <br><dd>The story behind the catacombs epitomizes (in both a positive and negative way) the wisdom that one shouldn't shit where one eats.  The story of the catacombs begins many hundreds of years ago, when Parisians discovered that it was easier to remove building stone from beneath the city than it was to import it from outside.  But after many years of this mining, there was no longer enough stone beneath Paris to support the city, and it began to collapse in places.  In this case, the variation on the theme of "don't shit where you eat" reads  "don't mine the foundation to build the roof."<br><dd>After the mines had been suitably reinforced to prevent further collapse, their utility grew out of the paradoxical state that had made them good mines for building stone: they were simultaneously <i>remote from</i> and <i>near to</i> the city.  Their first application was as a final resting place for the dead, which were so deeply stacked in surface cemeteries that they were posing a health hazard for adjacent communities (and actually changing the contours of the land).  Later, during World War II, they served as a home for the Resistance (who, like the dead, needed to be in Paris but also apart from it).<h2>more later</h2><p  ><font size=-1>View <a href=../europe0201/pages/370_buildingmural.htm target=newer>a gallery of pictures</a> from this adventure.</font></p></blockquote></font><p><center><font size=-1 color=666666 face=arial><a href="feedback.php?subject=Paris+Catacombs">send me mail</a><br><a href=020128.htm>previous</a> |<a href=020130.htm>next</a></center></font></body></html>
