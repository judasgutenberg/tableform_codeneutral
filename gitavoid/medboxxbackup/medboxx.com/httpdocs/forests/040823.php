 <dd>Today my body felt like attractive giftwrap for the shit within me. Gravity was an unusually powerful force and the most logical thing to do this afternoon was to take a bath. I had a conference call that went on for far too long and I felt like I was shouting up from the bottom of a well every time I tried to contribute to the discussion.
