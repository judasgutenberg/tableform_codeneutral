<h1>Green Ridge/Fifteen Mile Creek<a
href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></h1>
<ul>
<h2>General</h2><p>
<ul>
	Green Ridge is a typical NE-SW-trending feature of the Valley Ridge province
that owes its elevation to erosion resistant rocks, in this case the Devonian
Fore Knobs Formation.  Structurally, this formation crops out along the
northwest limb of a syncline and consists of sandstone, siltstone and minor
shale (Glaser, 1994).  It is overlain by the Hampshire Formation, which is also
largely sandstone of Devonian age, and which we have also encountered in the
Shenandoah Range (p.___).<p>
	In keeping with the general decrease in elevations from the southwest toward
the Potomac River (p.__), ridges in this area seldom exceed 1500 ft (460
meters) asl.  However, because Valley bottoms are correspondingly low, relief
is still substantial.<p>
	Forest in the area has virtually all been cut over at least once and much land
appears to be reverting to forest from marginal agricultural use.  Incised
across the grain of this modest and degraded mountain landscape Fifteen Mile
Creek yet embodies many virtues we associate with true wilderness.  It is wide,
in places deep and quiet, in places shallow and rushing among sandstone blocks
and boulders.  Where sunlight shafts between the trees its pellucid waters
reveal forms of fish and other life against light-flattened amber cobbles.
Somewhere upstream perhaps as far as their source in Pennsylvania, these waters
have encountered nutrient-rich rocks, such as carbonates, that have conferred
an unusual richness on this narrow riparian zone in an otherwise unpromising
terrain.<p>
	The regional forest between the Potomac River and Green Ridge was cursorily
examined from both the moving vehicle and on several short stops.  Although the
results of such brief encounters are certainly deficient, the impression is one
of monotonous secondary stands of Black, Scarlet, White and Chestnut Oaks, much
Red Maple and common Black Gum, Black Locust, Black Cherry and Virginia and
White Pines.  This sameness was somewhat relieved in ravines and riparian zones
by Hemlock, Tuliptree, Pignut and Mockernut Hickories, Service Berry and
Flowering Dogwood.  Much of the forest appears to be in the range of 40 to 50
years in age and frequently almost devoid of undergrowth such as Laurel and
Rhododendron.  Perhaps because of the generally low elevations near the road,
no Striped Maple was observed and Hawthorn, if present, certainly was not
abundant.  The lowest soil horizons generally appear deep but rocky.  it is
likely that the general character of the forest, its dominantly dry oak
component and apparent lack of diversity, follows from the generally siliceous
character of the formations described earlier and which prevail in the
region.<p>

<h2>Green Ridge State Forest HQ to Fifteen Mile Creek</h2><p>
<ul>
<b>Source Walk: 4-22-95</b><p>
	A trail was followed that led northwest from the HQ passing just south of
Interstate 68 to Green Ridge.  It then continued south along the crest of Green
Ridge to a swinging bridge on Fifteen Mile Creek.  The elevation along this
trail ranges from a little less than 1000 ft (300 meters) near the start to
about 700 ft (210 meters) asl at the creek.<p>
	The upland forest here appears to be dominated by Black, Scarlet, White and
Chestnut Oaks in approximate order of abundance.  Other canopy species of
common but less dominant occurrence are Pignut and Mockernut Hickories, black
Gum, Black Locust, Red Maple, Black Cherry, White and Virginia Pines, Sassafras
and Bigtooth Aspen (<i>Populus grandidentata</i>).  Service Berry (probably
<i>Amelanchier arborea</i>) and Redbud (<i>Cercis canadensis</i>), both in full
bloom, were abundant in the understory.  Shrubs included Fragrant Sumac
(<i>Rhus aromatica</i>), near Route 68, Blueberries (probably <i>Vaccinium
pallidum</i>), Black Huckleberry, a little Mountain laurel and St. Andrew's
Cross (<i>Hypericum hypericoides</i>).  Then on crossing a southeast facing
slope, where signs of abandoned agriculture hinted at better soils and abundant
moisture, there were scattered trees and small stands of White Ash and Sugar
Maple with an understory of Black Haw Viburnum and Flowering Dogwood.<p>
	A salient and somewhat surprising feature of the upland was the abundance of
Virginia Spring Beauty (<i>Claytonia virginica</i>) penetrating and blooming in
the heavy oak leaf mat and accompanied, at least nearby, with such acid soil
regulars as Teaberry, Early Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga virginiensis</i>),
Pussytoes (<i>Atennaria plantaginifolia</i>), Rattlesnake-Weed (<i>Hieracium
venosum</i>), Mountain Bellwort (<i>Uvularia pudica</i>), Gall-of-the-Earth
(<i>Prenanthes</i> sp.), Creeping Fiveleaf (<i>Potentilla
canadensis</i>/<i>simplex</i>) and, at tree bases, Haircap and
<i>Leucobryum</i> mosses.<p>
	Common Chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>), which could be either alien or
native, accompanied the alien Garlic Mustard (<i>Alliaria officianalis</i>),
was concentrated along the trail;  whereas the alien vine, Japanese Honeysuckle
(<i>Lonicera japonica</i>), characteristically occurred in the best soil areas.
Also in the latter, where Ash and Maple prevailed, the herb layer was dominated
by such species as Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio aureus</i>) and Cutleaf Toothwort
(<i>Dentaria laciniata</i>), both in bloom.  The toothwort was patronized by a
white butterfly, probably West Virginia White (<i>Pieris virginiensis</i>),
which is known to feed on <i>Dentaria</i>.<p>
	While few birds were yet evident in the bare-limbed upland forest, a brilliant
male Scarlet Tanager was seen, although no calls of this species were heard.<p>

<h2>Sugar Bottom Road Forest</h2><p>
<ul>
<b>Source Walks 4-22-95 and 4-23-95</b><p>
	This road lies on the crest of a west-trending ridge developed in Brallier
Shale, siltstone and minor sandstone (Glaser, 1994).  It attains an elevation
of 1000 ft (300 meters).  However the observed area lies at about 950 ft (290
meters) asl.<p>
	The forest here is dry but contained some magnificent oaks before they were
felled in a clearcut authorized by the Maryland State Forest.  The canopy at
this location is generally dominated by White, Black and Scarlet Oaks with
lesser amounts of Chestnut Oak.  There are also smaller Pignut Hickories and a
few Mockernut Hickories and Black Cherries.  The latter have the characteristic
inferior growth forms of the Valley and Ridge and which contrast so markedly
with the superior forms developed on the Allegheny Plateau.  As elsewhere in
the area, the understory contains abundant Service Berry, Redbud and Flowering
Dogwood.  There are also Virginia Pines in more or less concentrated stands.
Low shrubs consist mostly of Upland Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>).
<i>Leucobryum</i> cushions were common at tree bases and elsewhere Wood Betany
(<i>Pedicularis canadensis</i>), Virginia Spring Beauty, <i>Potentilla
canadensis</i>/<i>simplex</i>, Sweet Scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>)
and Crinkled Hairgrass (<i>Deschampsia flexuosa</i>) formed a scattered herb
layer.  Some of the felled oaks were fairly old with ring counts indicating
more than 130 years in age.<p>
	Despite the inhospitable environment of the clearcut in which we spent the
night the calls of Whip-poor-wills and Barred Owls and the lively activities of
Ravens, Robins and Pileated Woodpeckers in the morning inspired us with hope
for this forest.  It is likely however that the presence of these birds was in
some way related to the nearby benefits of Fifteen Mile Creek and its
tributaries that almost envelope this ridge.<p>

<h2>Fifteen Mile Creek</h2>
<ul>
<b>Source Walk 4-23-95</b><p>

	The visual prospect of this stream from the plunging rock spine of Green Ridge
is a promise only realized by close exploration of its bed and banks.  The
riparian forest initially encountered at the ridge crossing, with its canopy of
Hemlock (Adelgid-free), Black Gum, Red Maple, Sycamore and Northern Red Oak, is
impressive if not old.  Spice Bush hints at inherent richness and at this
season Trout Lily (<i>Erythronium americanum</i>) and Dwarf Ginseng (<i>Panax
trifolius</i>) were everywhere with the latter beating its five-leaved congener
(<i>Panax quinquifolius</i>) out of the ground and in bloom by several weeks.
Accompanying these were Spring Bluets (<i>Houstonia c&aelig;rulea</i>), also in
bloom, White Wood Aster (<i>Aster divaricatus</i>) and Sessile-leaved Bellwort
(<i>Uvularia sessifolia</i>).  However at this point botanizing was for a time
interrupted by the fauna, specifically several turtles disporting in the clear
water of the intermittently sunlit stream.<p>

<td><font size=-1><center>Two Wood Turtles (<i>Clemmys insculpta</i>) mating plastron-to-plastron.  Photo by R.F. Mueller</center></font></table>
	The Wood Turtle (<i>Clemmys insculpta</i>) is semi-aquatic and "found
primarily in or near clear brooks and streams in deciduous woodlands" (Ernst
and McBreen, 1991).  As do few other animals, it embodies the link between
aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in eastern deciduous forests.  Because it is
demanding of habitat quality and as a consequence increasingly rare (it is
classified C2 under the ESA), its observation here is not only a case of good
fortune but an endorsement of the quality of these waters and the surrounding
forest.  Far rarer yet was the happy circumstance of observing, on this late
April day, a pair engaged in mating (see photo inset), an event not previously reported in the
literature of herpetology in the detail offered us.  As expected, this event
occurred under water but somewhat surprisingly to some, plastron to plastron in
a veritable "missionary position."  This activity continued uninterrupted,
except for three intakes of air --presumably by the male-- for an hour and
three minutes at a minimum, beginning at 11:22 AM.  Is it possible that oxygen
was transferred between the turtles via the sex organs?<p>
	Not far downstream from where the turtles were observed a number of additional
canopy species were tallied.  These were Basswood (perhaps both <i>Tilia
americana </i>and <i>T. heterophylla</i>), Shagbark Hickory and White oak,
while Tuliptree also put in its first appearance and seemingly increased in
that direction.  These were also joined by Sugar Maple and Black Birch, which
however appeared to be confined to the steep north-facing slope at the flood
plain's edge.  Among understory and shrub species Muscletree appeared to be
particularly abundant while the floodplain, in addition to Spice Bush,
contained Smooth Alder (<i>Alnus serrulata</i>), an unidentified Dogwood and
Ninebark (<i>Physiocarpus opulifolius</i>).  Vernal flora and other herbs not
previously noted upstream were the Toothworts <i>Dentaria lacineata </i>and
<i>D. heterophylla</i>, Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>), Long-spurred
Violet (<i>Viola rostrata)</i>, Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera
pubescens</i>), Miterwort (<i>Mitella diphylla</i>), Round-lobed Hepatica
(<i>Hepatica americana</i>), Dutchman's Breeches (<i>Dicentra cucullaria</i>),
Wild Stonecrop (<i>Sedum ternatum</i>), Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum
thalictroides</i>), Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>), Solomon's Seal
(<i>Polygonatum biflorum</i>), Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>),
Star Flower (<i>Trietalis borealis</i>), a Mint (<i>Monarda</i> sp.),
Gall-of-the-earth (<i>Prenanthes</i> sp.), a thistle (<i>Circium</i> sp.),
Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>), Spinulose Shield Fern
(<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>) and Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris
marginalis</i>).  In one place, on a steep outcrop of thin-bedded red
sandstone, which here formed the base of the Hampshire Formation, there was an
occurrence of Walking Fern (<i>Camptosorus rhizophyllus</i>).  This fern is
frequently associated with carbonate rocks and it may be that this sandstone
has some calcareous cement or other conditions favored its growth here.<p>
	Where soils were a bit dryer and more acid a little Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria
procumbens</i>) and Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>) were
noted.<p>
	A more unusual plant, still unidentified, was found growing at the base of the
north-facing slope.  No flowers were visible on this bushy and rather glaucus
plant;  however its leaves hinted that it belonged to <i>Corydalis</i>.
Although the glaucus character pointed to <i>C. sempervirens</i> the leaflet
shapes were more consistent with <i>C. aurea</i>.  Both species have far
northern distributions and would approach their southern limits here.  If
present, either, combined with the confirmed presence of Canada Mayflower and
Star Flower, would tend to substantiate that a significant cold trap is
present, at least with respect to the herbs, at the base of this secluded
north-facing slope, although it lies at only 700 ft (210 meters) asl.<p>
	The communities described above lie between the spine of Green Ridge crossing
and Deep Run which joins Fifteen Mile Creek a half mile downstream.  The
semi-gorge of the small stream is steep-walled and narrow and is habitat for
some of the same plants as the floodplain of Fifteen Mile Creek.  Star Flower
was very abundant and the additional species Downy Yellow Violet (<i>Viola
pubescens</i>) and Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>) were recorded
here.<p>
	Fauna observed in the riparian zone of Fifteen Mile Creek were not confined to
turtles.  In the stream itself large fish were visible and aquatic insects such
as mayfly and stonefly nymphs were abundant.  Some oxbow ponds swarmed with 2
inch (5 cm) tadpoles.  Signs of Beaver abounded and a woodchuck (<i>Marmota
monax</i>) was seen foraging.  Although the season was early for birds,
Red-eyed Vireos (<i>Vireo olivaceous</i>) were already in the treetops while
Eastern Phoebes (<i>Sayornis phoebe</i>) were lower down.  A Red-Shouldered
Hawk (<i>Buteo lineatus</i>) was heard to call and a vanishing glimpse of Wild
Turkey (<i>Meleagris gallopavo</i>) was offered some in our party.  Most
spectacular however was a large bright orange-yellow Hognose Snake
(<i>Heterodon platyrhinos</i>) which may have been persuaded by hunger to
extend to mid-day its usual nocturnal and crepuscular activity.<p>
	The brief foray described here seems to indicate both a center of biologic
diversity and unusual physical conditions that have given rise to habitat for
northern and normally high-elevation plant species at low elevations.  These
special conditions may be confined to the base of the north-facing slope and
are analogous to conditions at Ice Mountain, West Virginia (Strausbaugh and
Core, 1978) but in a less extreme form.  In the latter instance boreal growing
conditions are created by winter ice persistence under talus and are very
local.  The same may be true along Fifteen Mile Creek and where the observed
effect, in any case, appears confined to herbs, since such southern species as
Tuliptree occur very nearby.<p>
