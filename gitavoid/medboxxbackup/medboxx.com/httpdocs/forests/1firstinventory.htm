<h1>1: First
Inventories </h1>
 
<p>What follows is a presentation of transcribed notes from
the early field trips that evolved into The Forests of the Central Appalachians
Project. These notes are presented with all their warts and omissions (especially punctuation!). Where clarification is needed, this is bracketed.</p>


<ul>
<h3>9-1-89 Trip to Va.-West Va. Line</h3>
<ul>
<p>1)
Monterey Mtn.-3880 ft. asl-Scarlet Oak, White Ash, Witch Hazel, few small Black
Locust, Elderberry, Sugar Maple, American Basswood</p>
<p> 2) Top
of Allegheny Mtn.-4330 ft. asl-Black Locust, Sugar Maple, Mountain Maple,
Yellow Birch, Striped Maple, Hawthorn, White Ash, Red Maple, Scarlet Oak, Red
Oak (?),Black Cherry, Beech, Chestnut Oak (?)</p>
<p> 3) Slab
Camp Run (from Rt. 55) ~3500 ft. asl.-Beech,
Sugar Maple, large Red Oaks, Red Spruce, Red Maple, Yellow Birch, Hawthorn,
Black Cherry, Mtn. Laurel, June Berry, Big-toothed Aspen*, Trembling Aspen (one
small plant), Hemlock, Blueberries, Black Locust(small), Lots of Lycopodia. A
small, fast flowing stream has what appears to Water Stonewort (<i>Callitriche
stagnalis</i>?), On [ Rt.] 55 there was a large Fraser Magnolia. We also saw a
small (~16&quot;) green snake which we took to be the northern Smooth Green
Snake. In a peculiar incident it was perched upon by a Fritillary butterfly!</p>
</ul>
<h3>9-21-89  Trip to Bratton's Run, Flood Plain Mesic Forest</h3>
<ul>
Tuliptree, White Oak, Black Oak, Black
Birch, Hemlock, White Pine, Pitch Pine, [Flowering] Dogwood, Spice Bush</p>
<p>[Drawing of Flower] Flower in bloom with almost perfoliate leaf-in boggy area of deep shade</p>
<p>I identified this as a grass of parnassus (<i>Parnassia
asarifolia</i>). </p>


</ul>
<h3>2-11-90 Trip to California Timber Sale area and North
Mountain &quot;Scenic Tour&quot;</h3>
<ul>
 (447) Studied [? ] Top (~3000'), -Noted
Chestnut Oak, Black Oak, Red Maple, Sweet Birch, Black Locust, Pitch Pine,
Table Mountain Pine, Black Gum, <i>Rhododendron maximum</i>?, Mtn. Laurel, Christmas
Fern, one Hemlock, Mountain Fetterbush, &quot;Banner&quot; Oaks and krumholtz. 
Rhododendrons seem largely confined to exposed western top slopes.</p>



</ul>
<h3>2-20-90  Visit to
California Timber Sale area, Group Selection Cuts, Clearcut # 4.
</h3>
<ul>

<p> Kelley (Sup.)[ G.W. Forest Supervisor ] believes regeneration will improve stand, but can't
give a reason except &quot;research.&quot; Access Road (System Road) Cost is
in Environ &quot;Assessment&quot;, but temp. roads not (part of $2500 total! 
). They also couldn't explain the occur. of clearcut on other side of stream
except that it is intended to increase the edge. Estimate a culvert and bridge
necessary to get logs across. Their best answer to justify the Cal. Timber Sale
is that it's in the plan! </p>

</ul>
<h3>Trip to
Mt. Pleasant, Pompey- Mt. Pleasant Loop Trail</h3>
<ul>
 
<p> The
dominant tree throughout appears to be Northern Red Oak. On the NW side of
Pompey Mtn Shagbark Hickory is very common with Red Oak. The area is mesic. The
soil development on granitic rocks favors moisture retention so that many
moisture-loving species occur in the herbaceous layer. There are Jack-in -the-
Pulpit and many members of the Lily Family, especially large Red Trillium,
Solomon's Seal, <i>Clintonia borealis</i>, and perhaps False Hellebore (?).
Umbelliferae of various types occur with Meadow Parsnip nearly everywhere. Wood
Betony is common (Red). Understory consists of Witch Hazel, Striped Maple and
Deciduous Holly (?) perhaps<i> Ilex Montana</i>. <i> Ribes</i> is also common.
Toward Mt. Pleasant Wild Lily of the Valley, <i>Maianthemum canadense</i>? 
becomes increasingly common &amp; forms mats with moss. Here Indian Cucumber
Root occurs also. The top of Pompey is a park-like (&quot;Orchard&quot;) old
growth krumholtz of Northern Red Oak with many dead snags and down wood. In
places the shrub layer becomes ericaceous with Pinxter or <i>R. roseum</i>
asalea, Huckleberry, Mtn. Laurel (often very large) and Rhododendron. This
growth extends to the top of Mt. Pleasant. On the way up I noted <i>Viburnum
alnifolium</i> (?) and Virginia Saxifrage, the latter in bloom.  Yellow Birch also appears with the ever
present Black Birch. On top of Mt. Pleasant there are only a few contorted Red
Oak with a complex shrub layer Of Rhododendron, Hawthorn, Choke Cherry,
Mountain Ash,  Hazel, Witch Hazel. <i>Sedum
telephioides</i> and S<i>axifraga michauxii</i> were noted. Although <i>Clintonia
borealis</i> had gone to seed at 3500' it was still blooming on top of Mt.
Pleasant. Mt. Maple also occurs. The return part of the loop on the N western
side of Mt. Pleasant is through a cool mesic forest with abundant Hickories of
different species and varieties (Pignut, Shagbark), Sugar &amp; Red Maple,
Basswood &amp; scattered Yellow Birch. As elsewhere Red Oak is common. On
Pompey we saw a Rose-breasted Grossbeak singing.</p>


</ul>
<h3>6-15-90  Trip to
Blister Swamp</h3>
<ul>
 Gus [ Mueller], Mike [ Jones ] and I to Blister Swamp and
vicinity. Noted what appears to be great waist high thickets of Glade St. Johns
Wort (<i> Hypericum densiflorum</i>) (?), very abundant Speckled Alder (<i>A.
rugosa</i>). Shevole [?]<i> Salix</i> glaucus underleaf [<i>Salix discolor</i>
?] but lonicleate[?] browsed to 2' high by deer. The <i>Saxifraga
micranthidifolia</i>, although not in bloom, was common in small feeder
streams, as was Golden Saxifrage (<i>Chrysosplenium americanum</i>). Noted <i>Cornus
canadensis</i>, Wild Lily of the Valley (<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>) (?) and
lots of <i>Oxalis montana.</i> The sedge <i>Carex crinita</i> was spectacular
&amp; abundant in the meadows. Noted very small fir seedlings but then none
smaller than 2&quot; diameter and 8' tall. High browse line noted. Also noted
fresh beaver kill by flooding of large firs indicating latter grew up in beaver
&quot;gap&quot;. Sphagnum is common even in meadows, particularly under <i>H</i>.
<i>densiflorum</i>.</p>



</ul>
<h3>
6-22-90
</h3>
<ul>

<p> Gus and I did a loop from Hog Camp Gap to Cow
Camp Gap-down Little Cove Creek and return to Hog Camp Gap via the North Fork
of the Buffalo. We saw no stands of virgin timber along Little Cove Creek but a
number of very large trees Oak Ash and Tulip &amp; others. The area is very
mesic with abundant plants such as jewelweed, <i>Laportia</i> etc. Tuliptree is
confined to elevations of about 2500'. We saw few Chestnut Oaks but some large
ones along lower reaches of the Buffalo near Little Cove Creek. The whole area
is wild and rocky and very mesic.</p>
</ul>
<h3>7-1-90 Trip to Buck Run Area of Laurel Fork on Forest
Ecology F.T.</h3>
<ul>
<p>1, Note Bracken &amp; hay-scented Ferns Teaberry
Columbine on edge of Red Spruce-White Pine Stand near picnic ground. We noted <i>Sambucus
pubens</i> &amp; the largest American Chestnut I ever saw a healthy 35',
6&quot; dbh tree although the species isn't common here. We also saw<i> Oxalis
montana</i> in bloom, Trillium (not in bloom), Arrowleaf Tearthumb (<i>Polgonum
sagittatum</i>) abundant in beaver meadow. We also saw Interrupted and
Cinnamon Ferns there.</p>

Ecology Field Trip to Mt Pleasant.</h3>
<ul>
 We (20 people) completed  the Mt Pompey- Mt Pleasant loop trail. Noted
a very few White Oak at elevations of almost 4100 ft. Also a few scattered
Sassafras  Cucumber Magnolia occur in
small amts. throughout but I only saw one Beech on the road leading in. Many
Green Headed Coneflowers were in bloom even in shady open woods, as was Tall
Bellflower (<i>Campanula americana</i>) at higher elevations. Nodding Wild
Onion (<i>Allium cernum</i>) was along the path &amp; along the road with
Sweet Joe Pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium purpureum</i>). Lots of Cow Parsnip &amp;
am Angelica all gone to seed. The cove forest at 3000 ft consists of lots of
Red &amp; Sugar maple Black Cherry Black Birch &amp; some Yellow Birch, Hemlock,
Basswood, a fair amt. of  Pignut &amp;
Shagbark Hickory. Much Red Oak &amp; a little White Oak, small Cucumber
Magnolias a very little Chestnut Oak. Also a quite a bit of White Ash scattered
everywhere some really large. On the Mt Pleasant summit rocks<i> Saxifraga
michauxii</i> was in bloom as was a low creeping moss-like plant. <i>Ilex
montana</i> is definitely present. The most battered and sick-looking
Rhododendron I ever saw is on the Mt Pleasant summit. Coral Berry is abundant throughout
indicating good soils as on Cole Mtn bald. Alternate leaf dogwood replaces
Flowering Dogwood at higher elevations. A few White, Pitch, Va. (?) Pines,
Chestnut sapling-sprouts are scattered at all elevations.</p>

</ul>
<h3>8-31-90 Trip to Hidden Valley. </h3>
<ul>
 
Gus &amp; I hiked along
both sides of the Jackson River where vegetation is quite mesophytic &amp;
resembles Pileated Peak except Sugar maple is much more abundant  on the slopes just above the banks &amp; more
diversity exists due to the river. Black Walnut is very abundant on the flood
plain &amp; many large sycamores &amp; some very large hackberry are present.
Many cardinal flowers bloomed along the bank &amp; I saw my first bladdernuts.
Also noted buttonbush, Smooth alder &amp; perhaps Speckled alder.</p>

confined below 2500 ft elevation There are large tracts of Chestnut oak with Mt
Laurel &amp; Rhododendron understory at mid elevations (2000-3000 ft). Above
this there is increasing Northern Red Oak with perhaps some Black Oak. On top
there is a contorted orchard type Northern Red Oak forest with no Chestnut Oak
but with  scattered Yellow Birch. Black
Birch occurs at all elevations but is most abundant at low elevations  It was ~10<sup>o </sup>: colder on top and we saw no flowers in bloom
there. The most common maple appears to be Red Maple at all elevations with a
little Sugar Maple. Pignut Hickory with slightly shaggy bark [ <i>Carya ovalis</i>

Maple, Basswood, Tuliptree at start in the N. River Flood Plain. Considerable
Service berry, Mt. Laurel, Mt. Fetterbush Witch hazel all the way up. At about
3500 ft Chestnut Oak drops out and is replaced by Northern Red Oak with Red
Maple, Black Birch some Black Gum Hemlock Black Cherry and Black Locust. This becomes
increasingly &quot;orchard-like and <i>Ilex montana</i> becomes abundant with
Serviceberry, larger Mt Laurel, also a little <i>Menziesia</i> and lots of

markedly cooler temperatures-perhaps more than 15<sup>o </sup>F cooler-than in
the Valley. We noted Red Maple partially stripped of bark-perhaps by Bear?
There were old wounds, partially healed but in some cases small trees were
dead. Chestnut sprouts were common at mid and high elevations We noted a
leopard frog [ likely a Pickerel Frog ]crossing the trail high up!</p>

number of large (18&quot;) <i>Magnolia acuminata.</i> Leaving the stream forest
becomes very xeric with dominantly Chestnut Oak overstoty and heath (Laurel
Huckleberry) understory. Here beautiful Grass-leaved Blazing Star (<i>Liatris
graminifolia</i>?) were in bloom, also Southern Bellflower (<i>Campanula
divaricata</i>). Along route, particularly near the top on N slope there is

<h3>9-7-91 [ Reddish Knob to Little Bald Knob ]</h3>
 
<ul>

<p>Steve and I walked the Little Bald Knob Road from near
Reddish Knob to Little Bald Knob. We noted Bear and Bobcat tracks (photos). 
The first part of the way is through xeric, ericaceous forest with much Pitch
Pine, Bear Oak  Laurel, Fetterbush
Huckleberry, Northern Red Oak, some Chestnut Oak  Red Maple, White Pine, Table Mtn Pine,

Mountain Ash    It then became more mesic with large old
&quot;orchard&quot; Northern Red Oaks, Bitternut, some Basswood, Black Cherry,

Hawthorn, Alternate Leaved Dogwood. Near top it became xeric and ericaceous
again with Laurel, Fetterbush Miniebush  Chokeberry,

Bear Oak, stunted Red Oak Pitch Pine   Fly Poison here seems, as elsewhere, to be
confined to the highest elevations. Large, very shiny Huckleberries (<i> G.

baccata</i>?) were very abundant.</p>


</ul>
<h3>
9-16-91

</h3>
<ul>

<p> Did this [ previous ] again on F. E [ Forest
Ecology ]Field Trip after the PAW[ Preserve Appalachian Wilderness ]
conf[erence] Discovered several Red Spruce along the trail and that the hickory

appears to be Bitternut rather than Pignut 
Turned over flat rock along trail. Vole with 5-6 young attached to teats

scurried from neat nest to other rock. Clever survival ploy against Bear! -and
primates.</p>


</ul>
<h3>9-22-91</h3>
<ul>
<p>

<p> On the
way there we also stopped at Gaudineer SA and Knob and at Blister Run along

250s where we observed ducks at the Beaver Ponds. On the way back along Route
20 [?] from Holly River we were impressed by the great wildland of steep

forested mountains we crossed.</p>


<p> On
ascending Rich Mt from the S.E. from RT 219[?] near Elkwater) one climbs
through somewhat dry oak-rich forest but this  changes dramatically at the top of Mill Ridge

and the entrance to Kumbrabow to mesic birch-rich forest at an elevation of
about 3300 ft. The latter appears to dominate south and through Kumbrabow but

gradually becomes maple-rich westward.</p>

10-13-91 Bald Mtn / Green Pond Mike
</h3>
<ul>


<p>  Steve and I hiked the trail from Bald Mtn on
the Blue Ridge Parkway to Green Pond near the St Marys Wilderness and the
proposed Kelly Mt. Wilderness.  Along

this trail the forest is markedly xeric and ericaceous with upland oaks (Chestnut,
Scarlet, Northern Red, White and Bear  1,

Red Maple, Black Gum Pitch and Table Mtn Pine Laurel, Fetterbush, much Mt.
Maple [ do I mean Striped Maple? ] and Rhododendron, Huckleberry, Service

Berry,<i> Menziesia</i>  Also, one Red
Elderberry was seen (large buds). </p>


<p> Green
Pond which is mostly a sedge meadow with Sphagnum between the sedges is

surrounded by Pitch Pine, Cleck [?], Red Maple forest,, edged by large
huckleberry (<i>G. baccata</i> ?) Black

Chokeberry,  Laurel, Rhododendron, Green
Briar. The forest surrounding the pond has the heaviest growth of Tea Berry (<i>Gaultheria

procumbens</i>) I ever saw forming almost continuous ground cover. This plant
is very abundant in the entire region. The elevation along this route exceeds

3000 ft everywhere and goes to almost 3400 ft In a few places there is mesic
forest with American Basswood (<i> T. americana</i>) but no Tuliptree</p>


<p> The
entire area is fairly heavily impacted by the Gypsy Moth with numerous egg

masses on some tree trunks.  </p>

<p> 
Activist rendezvous at Hidden Valley. On Sunday 20 we hiked up the road
that to the upland from the Warwick &quot;mansion&quot; for about a mile to

some clearcuts  These were about the
worst I ever saw. Scarlet Oak, White Oak forest with some Chestnut Oak, White

Pine Red Maple etc. prevails. The soil is light and sandy, site index can't be
much over 50! There is much erosion and poor regeneration</p>

10-27-91 [ Mill Mtn, in Rich Hole Wilderness ]
</h3>
<ul>

<p>-Mike Steve
and I hiked to the top of the ridge of Mill Mtn in the Rich Hole Wilderness and

also inspected a part of the &quot;Hole. The forest on the way up is fairly
standard xeric oak forest with lots of Chestnut Oak, some Black Oak Table Mtn

and Pitch pines and increasing Northern Red Oak toward the top. Tuliptree
appears  to be almost confined to the

Brattons Run Valley and other Valley, There is considerable Laurel, Fetterbush
and large Catawba? Rhododendron most of the way up. The top is quite mesic and

we noted the following</p>




<p>**Northern Red Oak  Beech                Flowering
Dogwood</p>


<p>*Chestnut Oak                        Black

Magnolia</p>


<p>*Pignut</p>


<p> The
upper &quot;Hole&quot; itself is dominated by very large Northern Red Oaks,
White Ashes and smaller Sugar Maple. Shagbark, White Basswood  are common. Black Birch, Slippery Elm (?) and

Chestnut Oak (?) are scattered throughout and there are a few small Beech. The
soils of the entire area appear to be deep friable and rich in organic matter.

They are almost black in color. We didn't get far enough down the
&quot;Hole&quot; to see Hemlock. At lea[st] one White Ash appeared to have 5'

diameter! <i>No Tuliptrees</i> were observed either on the upper slopes or in
the part of the &quot;Hole&quot; visited by us. A few Cucumber Magnolia leaves

were noted in the &quot;Hole&quot;.    </p>

11-17-91  [ Jones
Hollow, Shenandoah N.P. ]
</h3>
<ul>

<p>Much of this watershed is less than 2500' asl. Mike
Steve and I did a walk through Jones Hollow along Jones Run in Shenandoah NP

starting and ending at the parking lot. On top the forest is xeric with lots of
Chestnut and Black Oak, Pitch Pine, Table Mtn Pine(?), Pignut and Bitternut

Hickories, but strangely with much Poke ground cover. It becomes more mesic
rapidly downward with increasing amounts of White Ash, Tuliptree Black Birch

Shagbark, White (?) Basswood, Northern Red Oak Red Maple some Sugar Maple and
increasing amounts of White Oak near the Stream   Hophornbeam is very abundant. In some places

there are small Yellow Birches  Black
Locust and Striped Maple are very common as is Flowering Dogwood, Spice

Bush  Witch Hazel occurs but isn't
common. On the return along Brown's Gap Road there is much lush Bittersweet (

Celastrus scandens [?]), also along the Parkway.  Hackberry in understory   We noted<i> Dryopteris marginalis</i> and <i>Camptosurus
rhizophyllus</i> Ferns and an unknown evergreen? probably Senecio obovatus

(9-18-94) along the trail. The rock is greenstone. There were large trout in Doyles[?]
River just above the Jones Run confluence. A snake and frog were seen. Many

Pitch Pines were dying from Bark Beetle infections and Hemlocks were losing
needles due to some insect Adelgid? or disease. We noted scattered signs of

Gypsy Moths. There are many large Tuliptrees and Red Oaks. Beautiful Shagbark
and White Ash are very common. Along Browns Gap Road we noted a large wind

thrown White Oak that had exposed a 3 ft. profile of excellent rich, almost
black mull soil very high in organic matter, Spice Bush was very abundant and

lush in that area. There was considerable understory Hackberry also.  </p>

<ul>

<p>  Mike Steve I and 3 U Va students (Green&quot;) hiked from Turk Gap Parking lot via Turk Branch Trail Moormans
River Road and return via the AT in Shenandoah N P Below 2500' asl  It was cold. The upland at the start is

typical xeric upland oak but gets increasingly 
mesic toward the lowland with rich White Ash, Red Maple, Tuliptree

Northern red Oak. Shagbark, White Pine etc 
We noted no Beech or Fetterbush There's a little Bear Oak on top. We ate

persimmons. We also encountered some Black Walnut in the lowland. Hemlock here
is also thin-foliaged. The rock appears to be dominantly greenstone. </p>

1-22-92 (Wednesday)
</h3>
<ul>

<p> Mike Steve and I went to look at
the proposed Par Four Timber Sale South of 

Williamsville, SW of Campbell Run and NW of the Calfpasture River</p>


<p>The vegetation appears dominated by Black Oak with abundant
White Oak, Chestnut Oak. Black Gum Tuliptree, Red Maple, White Pine, Pitch
Pine, Virginia Pine are common. Flowering Dogwood, <i>Ostrea</i> and heath

vegetation (huckleberry Laurel  form the
understory) Some Table Mt Pine was

noted. Browns Pond (a special management area NE of this area) was visited.
The pond  which has a heavy fern-sedge

growth has a shrub border consisting of <i>Lyonia ligustrina</i> (Maleberry).       ,, Black Chokeberry and
Winterberry Holly. We noted a number of Pileated Woodpeckers. Black Locust is

common on edges of roads and clearcuts.</p>


<p> Driving
in we noted a peculiarity of light dry snow about 1/4 &quot; deep on the road
and nowhere else. The ground was mostly frozen with thick ice on ponds and

stream pools. The entire area has many large clearcuts with ill-formed
sprouts  and at higher elevations very

crooked sapling regeneration. Many of the larger trees appear to be very old
with tree rings no more than a millimeter in thick!</p>

<ul>

<p>  Mike Steve
and I visited proposed Braely Branch Timber Sale   Going up the Branch we noted a somewhat

mesic forest dominated by White Oak, Northern Red Oak and White Pine  apparently with good site indexes. Large
clearcuts ~15 yrs old extended over both stream banks. These showed many

multiple sprouts including Scarlet Oak, White Ash hickories</p>

<p> Mike Jones and I met Sherman Bamford and Rodney
Webb of South PAW at the N. Creek OA[Opportunity Area ] of the Jefferson N.F.
We hiked up Colon [?] Hollow (Large Beech, White Ash, Tuliptree, White Pine,

Blue Beech understory) and south over ridge consisting of some fairly large
but mostly young Scarlet Oak and White Pine with small Black Gum and understory

of Flowering Dogwood  and Mtn Laurel. We
encountered[?] clearcut with mostly Flowering Dogwood, Black Locust Red Maple

Tuliptree, Sourwood. <i>Hepatica americana</i> shows acid soil here in general.</p>


<p> Later we
drove to upper N. Creek which along the stream has much quartzite but further
up on the slope granodiorite and schistose Chloritic gneiss. Noted many stands

of even aged Tuliptree with some N. Red Oak and Sugar Maple, White Ash etc.
Large areas are mesic on good soils but practically Tuliptree monocultures.

There are many clearcuts, the older showing Sassafras  Black Locust, Red Maple, Dogwood regeneration</p>

is the most abundant maple on the bottomland. I only saw Sugar Maple on the

slope and then not large  Partridge Berry
is very abundant on the bottomland except in certain very mesic sites where

herbaceous mesic species dominate  Thus
its likely that acid conditions explain this dominantly mesic assemblage. The

Scarlet Oaks were some of the largest I'd ever seen</p>

<p> Steve and I went to
examine the area of the White Rock Timber Sale, We first proceeded down Laurel
Branch from FDR 77 Then up the higher ridges along this road are xeric oak-pine
forest (Chestnut, Scarlet, White and Black Oaks and Table Mt, Pitch and White
Pines with some Virginia Pines Black Gum Red Maple etc.) There is a variety of
heaths Huckleberry, Blueberry<i>, Lyonia ligustrina</i>, <i> Menziesia</i> Mt
Laurel, Teaberry.Further down stream there are abundant, mostly small White and
Scarlet Oak</p>


<p> To the
SW along FDR 77 where the South Fork of White Rock Branch crosses the forest is
quite mesic over large areas with mostly White and Scarlet oaks but also Am
Basswood, Northern Red Oak, Black Gum, Cucumber Magnolia, Sugar Maple, Shagbark

<p>We drove up RT 613 from RT 460 along the Doe Creek Valley
toward Mt Lake. At low elevations the forest is typical mixed mesophyte with Tuliptree,
Cucumber Magnolia, Sugar Maple, Red Maple, Yellow Buckeye, Beech, Shagbark

Northern Red Oak, Black Walnut, White Ash, American Basswood Sycamore,
Sassafras etc.  Further up we saw White

Basswood Buckeye Black Gum and upland oaks as well as maples. We hiked the loop
trail on Salt Pond Mt from RT 613 into the Mt Lake Wilderness to the

&quot;virgin timber&quot; just NE of the U Va experiment Sta. Here upland woods
consists mostly of Northern Red Oak, some Chestnut Oak, Black Gum Cucumber

Magnolia, Sassafras, Hemlock White Pine, Black Birch, White Oak (lots).
Understory consists of abundant Striped Maple, Service Berry(sp?), Mt Laurel, <i>Menziesia</i>

<p>Ground flora is rich with much <i>Hepatica acutiloba</i>,
<i>Galium triflorum</i>, Blue Cohosh, Black Cohosh, <i>Viola</i> spp, White

Baneberry (one plant of) was noted. White Snakeroot is very common. I also
noted<i> Hydrophyllum canadense</i> (possible). *<i>Circaea alpina</i> (

Alpine Enchanters Nightshade) (in bloom) was identified for the first time
by me. It grew with much O<i>xalis montana</i> <i>(</i>?), <i>Dropteris</i> sp?

and <i>Athyrium thelypteroides</i> ferns were noted A broad leaved sedge is
very abundant (<i> Carex</i> <i>plantaginea</i>?) Hoagie did some sketches No

Yew was noted but plenty of browse evidence of deer. There appears to be a
great deal of a low but erect plant (~6&quot;) high that may be the basal

leaves of an Anemone that didn't flower or the remains of die back after
flowering It resembles the basal long-petioled leaves of <i>Anemone</i> <i>canadensis</i>

or perhaps <i>A. virginiana</i> or<i> A. quinquefolia.</i> The latter seems
most likely. Christmas Fern is also present.</p>

Mike J., Steve K. and I met Dennis Hendricks of Cass, West Va at the

Blowing Springs Campground west of Hot Springs Va at the site of the proposed
Double Eagle TS.  It was our second visit

to the site. The site is quite mesic, consisting of scattered large trees of
Northern Red Oak, Chestnut Oak, White Oak, Tuliptree in a matrix of smaller

Sugar Maple, Red Maple, White Ash Am Basswood, Cucumber Magnolia with an
understory of Flowering Dogwood, Witch hazel, Serviceberry, Musclewood,

Hophornbeam, Hawthorn, Spicebush. also common White Pine Hemlock Black Locust
some Black Walnut</p>


<p> Herbaceous
species include White Snakeroot <i>Aralia nudicalis, A. racemosa,</i> Ginseng*,

Horse Balm, <i>Asarum canadense</i>, Clear Plant[ Weed ], <i>Polgonum
virginianum</i> Lots of Maidenhair Fern and Christmas Fern as well  Jack in the Pulpit is very common  <i>Hepatica americana</i> is very common in

cutting unit 7, a mile and a half east of the Campground In this area Sugar
Maple is abundant in all sizes up to about a foot in diameter in the hollow and

lower slopes but is largely replaced by similar sized Red Maple on upper
slopes. Cucumber Magnolia is also present in the understory as is White Ash.

Also abundant is a species of <i>Streptopus</i> (turned out to be <i>Disporum</i>) which we thought is <i>roseus</i> but has the elongate berry of <i>amplexifolius</i>,

a very rare (in this area) northern species. <i>Polygonum virginianum</i> is

<p> Steve K. Marti
Kovacks and I visited the site of the proposed Felix Timber Sale along Stony

Run, near Sugar Grove, West Va on the West slope of Shenandoah Mt. in the GWNF.
The area is one of largely slight slope and xeric oak forest. Scarlet Oak, Chestnut

Oak, Black Oak White Oak White Oak and a little Northern Red Oak dominate  There is considerable Pitch Pine and White
Pine in the upland and Hemlock with some Tuliptree and Cucumber Magnolia along

watercourses. There are impressive amounds[ts] of old down Chestnut tree trunks
in the upland oak forest which appear mostly of DBH~12&quot; trees from the

canopy with scattered (~100-150' separation) large (~2.5' DBH) oaks.  Understory is Black Gum, Flowering Dogwood
Serviceberry, White Pine etc with Mt Laurel and much Black Huckleberry. We also

saw some excellent straight, vigorous Chestnut saplings not apparently
diseased, one ~50' tall and 9&quot; DBH. We were struck however by the lack of

floral diversity it consisting largely of White Snake Root. Clear Pland[t][
weed] along moist areas with TeaBerry and a little Dwarf Spiraea along banks. I

saw one patch of Trailing Arbutus   Even
mosses seemed scarce One unit UnitV consisting partly of planted Red Pine was particularly barren with virtually no groundcover except a few ferns</p>

<p>  On the 26 we hiked up the trail on the NE side of the Valley, the same wed hiked last spring in the quite diverse but xeric forest with fire damaged oaks and pines on top  On the 27 we hiked up an old logging road on
the SW side of the Valley through a more mesic forest and following an intermittent  stream through rocky
terrain. We were impressed with the numbers of salamanders in perhaps 5 species uncovered under rocks. Some were Plethodon spp others not clear to our untrained eyes. There were also small (~ 1 inch) salamanders in pools in the stream bed.</p>

trail leading NE past the Stamp at around 3800' elevation where the forest is

xeric to mesic with lots of Black Oak, Red and Sugar Maple, Black Birch, N. Red
Oak some Chestnut Oak (here at unusually high elevation). Also Shagbark and

Pignut lots of large White Oak*  A quite

unlikely mesic forest floor which had only a thin leaf cover with little or no
resistant oak or beech leaves. In the stream course<i> Oxalis</i> grew up

through the thick mosses on boulders and we noted numerous clumps of large deep
green Saxifrage (?) probably<i> Saxifraga micranthidifolia</i>. As we approached Laurel Run Rhododendron maximum
appeared and became abundant. The forest became more birch-rich and younger (~25 yrs) Scattered Hemlock and some Red Spruce also grew here at ~3000' elevation  On wet rocks of the stream bed we found sedges and Clammy Hedge Hyssop (<i> Gratiola neglecta</i>). We also
turned some rocks on the way down and found small dark and light brown salamanders we couldn't identify. We were rained on all the way back. The rocks exposed consisted of much cross bedded sandstone  the best examples I ever saw.</p>
