<h3>1-17-93 Shenandoah National Park Trip</h3>
<ul>

-Mike Steve[Krichbaum] and I hiked down White Oak
Canyon from the Parking lot with a loop through &quot;Limberlost. &quot; On top
the forest is quite xeric with lots of White Oak some Chestnut Oak,  red Oak etc
Beginning at Limberlost it becomes more mesic with dominantly Canadian Hemlock
and some Red Spruce,  also lots of White Oak,  Northern Red Oak,  Red Maple Yellow
Birch,  Black Birch,  Black Locust,  Black Cherry,  also som Black and Scarlet Oak, 
Farther down Basswood (sp?) and Sugar Maple appear.  White Ash is common in all
mesic sites.  We saw only two small Am Beech and there is little White Pine.  Just
above the first falls at about 2600' elevation we encountered the first Tuliptrees. 
Striped Maple and Witchhazel.  Hophornbeam
are common understory as is Serviceberry and Hawthorn in the more mesic areas. 
Mt Laurel is the dominant shrub in all xeric and rocky areas.  We saw no
flowering Dogwood on this trip.  In the
high elevation mesic areas are numerous springs which contain Golden Saxifrage
 (<i>Chrysosplenium americanum</i>)  and other aquatic plants.  We noted a nice
colony of Shining Clubmoss  (<i>L.  lucidulum </i>) on the way back up  (We'd only gone as far down as the first
falls due to lateness).   We also noted a few anomalous Virginia Pines at over
3000' elevation.  They appeared to be
quite scrubby however.  All in all there were few green herbaceous plants available. 
There were patches of snow  (rare)  but much frost heaving.  Frost heaving signs
It was quite cold and windy above 3000'
but warmed a bit later in the day. </p>
</ul>
<h3>4-3-93 Dry River / Fulks Run </h3>
<ul>

<p> Steve K and I tripped to
upper Dry River Watershed west of Fulks Run in the GWNF.  We hiked upstream on
Forest Trail 594 along the base of Stony Point Ridge almost to the divide.  The lower part of the trail is in a rich
riparian zone which has a lot of Hemlock  (some fairly large ~30&quot; dbh)  but not old White Pine,  large
Pignut Hickories,  White Oak,  some fairly large Black and Northern Red Oak. 
Tuliptree is common and farther up a beautiful side slope a cove of ~28&quot;
Sugar Maple.  There is aso [spel.  ] Shagbark Hickory,  a few Beech,  Butternut</p>

<p> On the
upper valley there is Red Maple and many of the oaks killed by the Gypsy Moth. 
About the only obvious ground cover noted was Partridge Berry.  Wine Berry is
fairly common along the trail. </p>

</ul>
<h3>5-2-93 Dolly Ann </h3>
<ul>

<p>Trip by Steve K,  Joe Ramsey and I to
Dolly Ann Special Management Area ~2100' asl at road</p>

<p> We hiked
up Dolly Ann Hollow about a mile noting very large Hemlock,  White Pine, 
Chestnut Oak,  White Oak,  with smaller Northern Red Oak,  Tuliptree,  Red Maple, 
Basswood.  Shagbark Hickory,  but one very
large Pignut Hickory.  Many of the trees show
fire scars at the base.  There is also a
fair amount of Black Gum,  also not as large as the largest tree.  The understory
is Witchhazel and much Rhododendron [ <i>R.  maximum</i> ]along the stream and
Mt Laurel on higher land.  There is also Serviceberry.  We noted no Sugar Maple
and little White Ash.  <i>Mitchella repens</i> is common.  On the steep stream
bank we noted<i> Arallia nudicaulis </i>and possibly <i>Panax trifolius</i> and
<i>Anemone lancifolia</i>.  In the open we noted<i> Medeola virginiana</i> and
other Lily family members (<i> Uvularia</i> (?) <i>Smilacina </i>?)  We noted
one beautiful<i> Trillium grandiflorum</i> in bloom along the stream.  We also
noted a little Wild Yam as well as numerous trifoliate and other herbaceous
plants we couldn't identify. </p>

<p>There was much deadfall wood some,  very large old moss
covered,  as well as debris dams in streams.  We noted few birds and apparently
no warblers in the treetops or elsewhere.  We did hear Pileated Woodpeckers and
Blue Jays.  We saw no visible life in the stream.  We did see much evidence of
deer  (Droppings,  browse of Smilax etc)  and one slightly knawed [spel. ]  by Beaver tree.  We saw the first Short leaf Pine
we ever saw,  a large,  very tall specimen! It was on a steep slope above the
stream.  </p>

<p>We also drove up the road toward Bald Knob which
presumably forms the NE edge of the special management area.  The road is very
rough and eroding and passes through numerous 15-20 year old clearcuts,  some
with a rich Red Maple component,  The forest is xeric,  ericaceous and stunded [
spel. ] oak  (Black Scarlet,  Chestnut etc)  with Mt.  Laurel and Huckleberry.  On
top it becomes Northern Red Oak-White Oak with Striped Maple understory with <i>Ribes
</i>in openings.  We also noted many Pitch Pines. </p>

<p> There
were many &quot;wildlife openings&quot; at the end of short roads leading from
this main road.  Service berry was conspicuous here at ~3500' elevation since it
was still in bloom</p>

</ul>
<h3>5-9,  10-93 Grassy Mtn </h3>
<ul>


<p>Trip by Steve K and I to the Grassy
Mtn Opportunity Area,  Monongahela,  N F to meet with Dennis Hendricks at the
Island Campground in Pocahontas County,  West Va</p>

<p> On the
9th we drove up Forest Road 112 toward Spruce Knob.  When we encountered stands
of second growth spruce we explored to the NW of the road and discovered Water
Starwort  (either <i>Callitriche palustris </i>or <i>C.  hegerophylla</i>) 
growing in a small stream which also contained small fish  (non-darters)  and
at least one 3 inch salamander.  Ground
cover consists of Lycopods and mosses including Sphagnum.  We noted one old
Table Mtn Pine* smothered by second growth Red Spruce</p>

<p> We then
hiked to the SE of the road down an old timber sale road which led to a
clearcut.  We noted that the forest here  (Beech,  Red Maple,  Cherry,  Yellow and
Black Birch,  White Ash and Hemlock with some small invading Spruce)  had
dominant ground cover of Lycopods and Yellow Trout Lily,  a <i>Erythronium</i>
without auricles on petal base and no reclining capsule,  a contradiction
according to Strausbaugh and Core! Its amazing how this flower,  already done
blooming,  covers many square miles of deciduous forest here at~3900' asl.   Its likely that this was once spruce forest
and hence the Lycopods.  The soil organic layer appears to be about 4&quot; deep
above a light colored uniform mineral soil.  We also noted <i>Maianthemum canadense</i>
in a damp area under Hemlock</p>

<p>On returning to the Island Campground-elevation ~3000' I as
usual explored-mostly in morning of the 10th-the vicinity.  Here as elsewhere, 
we noted a spectacular nodding Trillium[ Hunsucker says this is <i>T.  erectum</i>] with deep purple petals,  also in contradiction to Strausbaugh and Core's
book.  Also noted beautiful <i>Trillium undulatum.  Maianthemum canadense</i> is
very common as are the toothworts  (<i>D.  laciniata</i> and <i>D.  diphylla</i>).  In places <i>M.  canadense</i> is intergrown with <i>Panax trifolius. </i>
Also there were several anemonies,   Mountain and others. <i> Veratrum viride</i>
is common.  Shrubs include <i>Viburnum alnifolium</i> Witchhazel and Mt.  Laurel. 
Foam Flower,   Partridge Berry and Oxalis occur.  The trees include Black and
Yellow Birch,  Sugar and Red Maple,  White Ash,  Beech Hemlock and a few Northern
Red Oak.  Wood Betony in bare soil along,  stream.  Noted considerable bird life,  including small treetop
inhabitants  (warblers) .  I identified
the Red Eyed Virio [spel. ] for the first time.  Chipping Sparrow foraged around
our table.  On this trip we also drove to the top of Spruce Knob.   Near the top noted much Skunk Current[spel]
along road</p>

</ul>
<h3>5-10-93 Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove </h3>
<ul>

<p>We drove to the
Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove.  a ~65 acre
remnant of the primary forest-very impressive along a fine little stream.  Most
impure[ ?] dead falls and ancient down trees,  snags of every age and size,  many
forming debris dams in the stream.  The mesic forest in the bottom is very
diverse,  dominated by large Hemlock with Sugar and Red Maple,  White Ash.  Understory of <i>Viburnum alnifolium </i> (in
bloom)  and Striped Maple.  A partial list of herbaceous species includes very
abundant <i>Viola rotundifolia,  Maianthemum canadense</i>.  Black
Cohosh,  Blue Cohosh,  Jack-in the -pulpit,  Foam Flower.  Mtn Anemone,  Christmas and other ferns.  There
is also Beech and Service Berry.  Black
and Yellow Birch.  On climbing the slope oaks and pine increase with very large
White Oaks,  also Northern Red and magnificent White Pine.  Farther up there is
Black Gum,  Chestnut Oak and a little Pitch Pine.  The entire area is infiltrated
with mostly small understory Red Spruce,  perhaps a result of an expansion of
the species due to climate change or fire suppression  (here at &gt;3000' asl?).  The strean appears to be rich in tiny crayfish and we heard a Scarlet
Tanager.  </p>


</ul>
<h3>Big Run</h3>
<ul>

<p>We ate lunch at Big Run and then proceeded up the Run
from Highway 28.  We noted great floral and avian diversity,  saw a water snake
swimming down stream near a debris.  and
several trout.  The forest here at ~2600' asl consists largely of Black and
Yellow Birch,  Red and Sugar Maple.  Beech, 
White Ash,  some Tuliptree,  Hemlock,  Northern Red Oak.  Basswood (species?) Magnolia (Cucumber?),  <i>Viburnum
alnifolium </i>and Great Rhododendron.  Service Berry and Witchhazel are
common.  *Importantly we suddenly
encountered an isolated patch of Canadian Yew on a 6ft high steep sided
cross-bedded sandstone rock about 15ft x 15ft in dimension.  There was evidence
of deer browsing and droppings on this rock but the Yew is not heavily browsed. 
Many mesic herb species are present including the purple nodding Trillium [
likely <i>T.  erectum</i> ],  Foam Flower Miterwort,  Phlox <i>stolonifera</i>,  <i>Dentaria
diphylla</i>.  Dutchman's Breeches  (not
in bloom) .  <i>Maianthemum canadense</i>
is very common and I noted an unidentified and heavily browsed shrub  (alt. 
with prunistile[spel?] leaves)  near the Yew rock on the trail.  We also saw and
heard the beautiful song of the Red[Rose] Breasted Grossbeak.  We also heard Scarlet
Tanagers. </p>

 </ul>

<ul>


<p> Steve and I visited the Little North Mtn
&quot;Wildlife Management Area  (State)  entering at the &quot;Hunter
Access&quot; several miles SW of Buffalo Gap,  Va on RT 42.  We then hiked up the road to the left and on
top of the ridge took the trail south along the east side of the Mtn.  The west side of Little North Mtn is quite
rich with NW Aspect.  a number of well
watered coves.  The lower part is dominated by Tuliptree,  Northern Red Oak (
very large) .  much small red Maple,  Some
Beech,  fairly abundant White Ash,  Am Basswood,  Shagbark,  large Pignut,  some
nice canopy Butternut,  Cucumber Magnolia,  Black Oak.  White Oak,  Chestnut Oak,  some White Pine, 
Black Gum is common.  Striped Maple,  Flowering Dogwood,  Sassafras are common as

and some Pitch Pine.  During the hike 7
Scarlet Tanagers.  5 Common Yellow
Throats,  many Red-eyed(?) Vireos,  several,  Baltimore Orioles,  Wood peewee,  a Pileated Woodpecker and several Wood
Thrush were heard.  Birds seem considerably more common in the mesic forest. </p>


 </ul>
<h3>6-5-93 Back Creek Mtn</h3>
<ul>

<p> Mike Jones,  Steve Krichbaum,  Joe
Ramsey and I visited the proposed Blue Tees Timber Sale on the west side of
Back Creek Mtn However we hiked up a small stream valley on the SE flank of the
Mtn just across RT 39 from the Blowing Springs Campground.  The area is very
mesic in the lower part of this watershed with Black,  Sugar and Red Maples. 
Tuliptree,  Am Basswood Northern Red R callet [spel.  words?] Black and White
Oak,  White Ash,  Cucumber Magnolia.  Black
Walnut (a few).  fewer Butternut, 
Shagbark,  Pignut.  Beech,  Hemlock Slippery

still with an abundance of herbaceous ground cover  (dominated by Black Cohosh) <i>Sanicula gregaria</i> common.  <i>Aralia
nudicaulis </i>on north slope at higher elevations On the highest ridge and on
the other side at unit [?] we noted many large northern Red Oak,  Pignuts and on
the way up possibly White Basswood.  We heard RB Grossbeak ? Vireos and Scarlet
Tanagers were also heard</p>

  </ul>
<h3>6-13-93 Narrowback Mtn. </h3>
<ul>
<p>
Steve K and I went to look at the Narrowback Mtn &quot;Grouse habitat
improvement project&quot;.  We climbed up
to the ridge top on the trail from near &quot;Hearthstone Lake&quot; and then
came back down part way to examine cutting units 13,  14 and 15 situated in weak
coves facing N. W.  These coves are dominated by rather small but straight
Northern Red and Chestnut Oak,  some Black Gum and Red Maple.  In the dryer parts
there is mostly Chestnut Oak with Huckleberry Laurel and Blueberry.  In the coves there are
fewer shrubs and those mostly Huckleberry and Blueberry.  <i>Aralia nudicaulis </i>is fairly common on
N facing slopes. </p>

<p> The
forest in lower riparian areas near the road by Hearthstone Lake is rich in
large beautiful White Pine with smaller Hemlock.  On the slopes immediately
above there is more White Oak,  Scarlet Oak,  Chestnut Oak and possibly some
Black Oak.  Northern Red Oak is common also</p>

<p> Birds
noted were Scarlet Tanager,  Common Yellow Throat and Yellow Billed Cuckoo </p>

<h3>6-28-93 Peters Mtn Trail / AT </h3>
<ul>

<p>We hiked up the Appalachian
Trail from Stony Creek (elevation 2300' asl) up to the top at ~3800 asl.  First
part was up a rich cove / riparian zone with mesic forest consisting of much
Hemlock,  Northern Red Oak.  Am Basswood, 
White Ash.  Cucumber Magnolia.  Tuliptree Great Rhododendron,  <i>Aralia
racemosa</i> and possibly <i>Aralia nudicaulis,  Disporum </i>a <i>Clintonia </i>probably <i>umbellulata. </i> At about 3000' ft
<i>Maianthemum canadense</i> Silky Cornel <i>Cornus</i> <i>amomum </i>is
present along Stony Creek.  Higher up on
slope convexities more Chestnut Oak,  Scarlet Oak,  and Fly Poison began to
occur.  No Striped Maple?</p>

<p> On top
at ~3800 asl is a basically Northern Red Oak-White Oak forest with a little
stunted Chestnut Oak,  Black Gum.  Ground cover is<i> Vaccinium, </i> Fly Poison, 
American Chestnut Sprouts.  Some Flame Azalea still in bloom.  Galax, <i> Menziesia,  </i>Mt Laurel,  some<i>

  </ul>
<h3>6-28-93 Potts Mtn Pond,  Trip to Potts Mtn Pond </h3>
<ul>



<p> (Steve and I)</p>

<p> Walk in
from FR176 along Trail 630~3/4 mi through xeric Black Oak,  N.  Red Oak,  Chestnut
Oak,  Bear Oak forest with ericaceous ground cover,  Black Gum,  Red Maple, 
Striped Maple,  Whorled Loostrife[spel. ]  (in bloom) .  Fly Poison  (in bloom),   Bracken Fern,  Wild

Pond area Northern Red Oak-White Oak with little Chestnut Oak,  Black Gum,  Much
low Blueberry<i> V agustifolium</i>[ spel.  ]  (ripening) .  <i>Menziesia</i>,  Sassafras Service Berry. 
Fire Pink is very abundant. </p>

<p> The Pond
is ~3 / 4 acre with mudflats in center surrounded by sedges and grass. <i> Carex
gynandra</i> appears to dominate.  A St Johns Wort probably mash St Johns Wort (
<i>Hypericum virginicum</i>(?) is common.  A shrub border consists of <i>Ilex
verticillata, </i> <i>Viburnum cassinoides,  Pyrus melanocarpa</i>,  very large <i>Menziesia
pilosa, </i> Black Birch,  Black Gum,  Mt Laurel.  In this border and extending
into the forest is a ground cover of <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses with<i> Maianthemum
canadense</i>,  mats of <i>Rubus</i> <i>hispidus</i>,  in dryer areas Galax, 
Teaberry.  <i>Aralia nudicaulis</i> is very abundant everywhere in the dryer
forest. <i> Ilex montana </i>was noted in the outlet.  Ferns include Cinnamon. 
Indian Cucumeroot[spel. ] and Wild yam and <i>Smilax</i> are common.  Many oaks, 
Witch hazel M<i>enziesia </i>even maple show heavy partial defoliation by
native (?) defoliators.  Several frogs,  including possibly Mountain Chorus frogs
were heard and several small <i>Hyla</i>(?) were seen hopping under down trees
in the Pond edge. </p>

<p>The
entire area of the pond has abundant down wood.  This pond is at high elevation
&gt; 3500'asl)  and the soils very stony  (red ss)  and as a consequence the
trees are widely spaced and very contorted &quot;orchard types&quot;.  Many also
show fire scars.  Birds noted were Vireos,  G Crested Fly catcher.  Small-some biting-insects were very common</p>


  </ul>
<h3>7-6-93 Allegheny Mtn / Five Wood T. S.  </h3>
<ul>


<p> Trip of Steve and I
to the area of the proposed Five Wood Timber Sale on Allegheny.  Mtn on the Va-West Va line</p>

<p> We began
our observations at the 3621 ft.  benchmark at the crossing of FR 55 at Chestnut
Flats.  We had approached from Route 39 from the South-noting fairly xeric
forest with abundant Chestnut Oaks.  At the 3600' level this oak vanished and
the area at the benchmark is very rich in Shagbark and perhaps pignut hickories
and Northern Red Oak.  Also common is
Black Cherry,  Black Birch,  and White Ash,  A Butternut was noted in a nearby clearcut in the Monongahela on the
West Va Side.  Black Cohosh is common ground cover.  No <i>Maianthemum canadense</i> or <i>Aralia
nudicaulis </i>were noted despite the elevation.  On our walk in to.  proposed cutting units 4, 3, 2 and 1 we noted Red
Maple much Striped Maple,  Witchhazel Hawthorn,  Wild Plum with fruit (green), 
calls of Wood Thrush and vireos.  White Snakeroot is also common.  At the point
of descent into the cove of unit 4 we noted Hay-scented Fern and Maidenhair
Fern.  Also on the trail in we saw the largest tree (recently dead) I've seen
east of the Mississippi,  a giant 6' diameter Northern Red Oak (photos of Steve
and I) All photos (film) have [been] destroyed. ,  Down in the cove more large Northern Red Oaks and also very large Sugar
Maple and farther down Black Gum and large Chestnut Oak,  here at 3200'
elevation.  Not much ground cover,  but noted one Ginseng (<i> Panax
quinquefolius</i>.  in bloom,  also large
white Oak.  Understory appears to [be] Azalea about 7' tall with Witch hazel and
abundant Striped Maple.  The area is particularly characterized by many large
and small dead falls,  particularly of American Chestnut.  Sprouts of the
later[spel. ] are also common.  Here also I saw my first live example of the
Forest Rattler.   (Crotalus horridus) 
just beneath a down tree and just where I had intended to step over,  Lucky I
approached from the side he/she was on.  We took photos of this very dark snake. 
We also saw a large Ruffor[spel. ?] american toad,  a chipmunk and several deer. 
A few <i>Menziesia</i> and <i>Disporum </i>were noted on the sparsely vegetated
forest floor.   There were also some fine
Pignut and Shagbark Hickories,  a little Hop Hornbeam and as we approached
cutting unit 1 Sugar.  Maple increased
with many inch thick saplings as well as a few very large trees.  Christmas Fern
was common and some Cinnamon Fern was noted.  <i> Circaea alpina </i>may be
present. </p>

<p> We then
went to look at unit 6 at a little higher elevation (~3600') with the road at
~3800'.  It lies in a very rich area.  Shagbark,  Black Cherry,  red and Sugar
Maple,  Northern Red Oak (dominant),  Black Birch,  Black Oak,  White Ash,  American
Basswood,  White Oak,  Cucumber Magnolia are important trees.  The understory
contains Sassafras (minor).  Striped
Maple,  Witch hazel,  Azalea (Sp?) Hophornbeam Hawthorn,  Beaked Hazelnut,  Red
Elderberry.  Ground cover includes Maidenhair Fern,  heavy combination of <i>Laportea</i>
and Horsebalm,  Black Cohosh (species?). <i> Aralia nudicaulis </i>is very
abundant as distinguished from the other cutting units visited <i>Disporum</i>,  Wild Yam,  Senacle,  Sweet
Cicily[spel/],  Yellow Jewelweed <i>I.  pallida,  </i>Columbine are common as is
Black berry along the road. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>7-20,  21-93 Trip with Hoagie to Blowing Springs </h3>
<ul>

<p>The weather was clear,  warm and dry.  Hoagie
did some paintings while I botanized.  Rock: Ridgeley Sandstone with limestone</p>

<p>The forest at the Campground consists dominantly of
Tuliptree.  Black Maple,  Black Walnut, 
Slippery Elm.  with minor Pignut,  Northern
Red Oak,  White Oak.   White Oak is minor Musclewood
is the most abundant understory tree.  elevation is ~ 1700' asl There are
several vines Canada Moonseed and Sweet Cicely and<i> Hydrophyllum virginianum</i>
are common ground cover.  Downstream east,  along Back Creek trail,  there is a
very lush forest and openings.  Here Sugar Maple is common and on the
mountainside an almost pure tuliptree second growth but with some fairly large
trees.  There is also much Black Birch,  White Ash,  Black Locust,  probably both
American and White Basswood,   (Basswood is common)  Butternut,  Black Walnut, 
Beech,  Black Cherry,  further on Hemlock,  with Rhododendron  (<i>R.  maximum</i>) understory.  No Red Maple is recorded Is it here? There are also some Cucumber
Magnolias.  Small trees and shrubs include very abundant Musclewood,  Red Bud, 
Witchhazel.  Alternate leaved Dogwood, 
Bladdernut,  Paw Paw.  <i>Rubus odoratus</i> is commoon in openings as is
Hydrangea.  Large areas of damp,  steep talus slopes are covered by <i>Laportea
canadensis</i> and<i> Impatiens pallida,  Aralia racemosa </i>and <i>A. 
nudicaulis</i> grow to large size along the trail.  Wingstem is very common and
large as is Showy Sunflower,  <i>Polygonum virginianum</i>,  White Snakeroot.  Lopseed,  <i>Campanula Americana </i> (in
bloom) <i>Aster lateriflora </i>Hollow Joe Pye Plant[ weed ],  <i>Silphium
trifoliatum. </i> Here I identified my first Avens  (White)  (in partial bloom).  Along the trail I also saw Burr Cucumber,  Clearplant[weed],  Enchanter's
Nightshade (<i>Circaea quadrisulcata</i>),  <i>Thalictrum clavatum</i>,  Four leaved Wild Yam,  <i>Geranium maculatum </i>Dutchmans
Pipevine,  Virginia Creeper,  <i>Hypericum ellipticum</i></p>

<p>Up under the tall Tuliptrees on the slope above the
stream there are many ferns  (Christmas,  Maidenhair*,  New York),   also Jack in
the pulpit,  Black Cohosh sp <i>Aster divaricatus</i> May Apple,  <i>Hepatica
acutiloba </i>and <i>H.  Americana</i>.  Here I saw my first <i>Hydrophyllum
canadense</i> going to seed and looking like <i>Hydrastus</i>! But I saw none of the latter. </p>

<p>The
stream here has many rapids being perpendicular to the strike of the steeply
dipping rocks.  Shores are cobble.  Sycamore is very abundant along the shore as
is Ninebark and Bittersweet.  There are scattered large clumps of sedge (?) and
much Dogbane.  I noted also the large mint,  <i>Teucrium canadense</i>.  There
were a number of small spiral gastropods,  as well as fish in the clear water. </p>

<p>Other
plants noted were Thimble plant[weed]  (<i>Anemone virginiana </i><i>Uvularia perfoliata.  U,  grandifolia</i>?[<i>grandiflora</i>],  <i>Prenanthes
</i>spp, <i> Viola </i>spp,  False Solomonseal,  Carrion Flower and other Smilax
spp.  We also observed a bat flying as well as creeping around a snag on the
River bank.  I also heard calls of Wood Thrush  (frequent till late.  Vireos and
Scarlet,   Tanagers,  spectacular orange and black millipedes were also observed. </p>

<p>I also
noted a common grass which had a conspicuous head that I took to be <i>Hystrix
patula</i> or Bottlebrush Grass.  Also
Sassafras. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>8-6,  7,  8,  9-93 Laurel Fork Wilderness and Mtn </h3>
<ul>

<p> rendezvous
Trip by Steve K.  and I to Laurel Fork Campground and Laurel Fork North and
South,  Beaverdam Ridge Opportunity Area and Elkins West Va </p>

<p>We left in a pleasant rainstorm Friday 6 forenoon and
arrived at the Campground at about 2:00 PM.  Steve and I hiked on downstream trail
into the Laurel Fork Wilderness.  The forest is fairly young mostly Yellow
Birch-Sugar Maple-Beech with much Black Cherry,  fair amount of Hemlock and some
Spruce and Red Maple.   no Black
Birch?.  There are scattered White Ash and
a few large Cucumber Magnolia.  Skunk Cabbage is very common as is Musclewood,  <i>Oxalis</i>
(<i>Montana</i>?) and <i>Maianthemum canadense </i>are the dominant ground
cover.  There is also Hop Hornbeam,  Service Berry,  Striped and Mt Maple-and
along the stream Hawthorn,  Speckled Alder  (Large),   Witch Hazel Also noted <i>Chrysosplenium
americanum, </i> Clearplant[weed], <i> Viola </i>spp.  White Snakeroot, <i> Impatiens capensis</i>.  Jack in the pulpit.  Oswego Tea in bloom,  <i>Rubus odoratus</i>.   Kingfishers were common along the stream and
Red Squirrels were noted.  Vireos were also calling.  There are planted Red Pine
at the Campground.  No ericaceous
vegetation was noted downstream.  We enjoyed dead ripe,  very large Service Berries
along the stream This is the most mesic forest I've seen.  No oak was seen. </p>

<p>On Aug 7
we hiked upstream into the Laurel Fork South Wilderness.  The forest is similar to that downstream
with some additions We noted Blue Cohosh  (berries)  remains of a foot tall
orchid possibly a <i>Habenaria,  Disporum</i>? <i>Uvularia </i>and in the
lowland next to a fen[spel. ] much<i> Aralia nudicaulis</i> as shown by many
berry stalks.  This wetland has many tall herbs: Boneset,  <i>Panicum </i>sp?,  <i>Carex
gynandra Impatiens.  capensis, </i>
Cinnamon Fern,  Tear Thumb  (<i>Polygonum</i>)  <i>Solidago graminifolia/ S. 
gigantea</i>?.  Glade Spurge! Mountain
Holly- <i>Ilex montana</i> here This appears to be an old beaver meadow. 
Farther on on upland slopes in woods along the trail.  Indian Cucumber Root, 
Panicled Hawkweed Wood Betony incoh[spel?] Skunk Cabbage,  Hemlock,  Spruce <i>Veratrum viride</i>,  a little <i>Rhododendron
maximum. </i> Square-stemmed Monkeyflower noted in damp openings.  no Black Birch? At the base of of many Spruce
liverwort is common.  New York Fern is very common as are at least three species
of <i>Lycopodia </i>Spp incl.  L. <i>
lucidulum.  Oxalis </i> (<i>montana </i>?)  is everywhere and some<i>
Maianthemum canadense</i>.  Finally we also saw a little Christmas Fern.  At one
place on the shores of a small pond in the open we found a pile of dead 6&quot;
chubs? piled up,  perhaps by a mink!.  In
places there are many small spruce showing this tree making a comeback under
the Yellow Birch,  Sugar Maple,  Beech overstory,  A little farther on there seemed to be more <i>Cladonia.  </i>In one
place,  in a small seep area with <i>Veratrum viride</i>,  we saw our first
*Glade Spurge,  perhaps a dozen yard-high clumps which I photographed.  A white
fungus? bloom was on the Glade Spurge and we could find no seed capsules At another opening we saw lush Wild Rye of
unknown species.  On our return we saw one clump of <i>Viburnum alnifolium</i>
and in an open seep Ninebark.  An Avens as well as a few American Chestnut
sprouts were noted as well.  Red Maple is omnipresent in small numbers. </p>

<p>Aug 7,  1993 Beaver Dam Run to Laurel Fork On Aug 7
afternoon we went west to the Beaver Dam Opportunity Area along Beaverdam Run. 
Steve,  Dennis[Hendricks] Charlie[Sullivan],  Alice and I</p>

<p> At the
road (FR 14) we noted <i>Spiraea alba</i>,  Ninebark,  <i>Solidago graminifolia </i>?
Northern Willow Herb(?) Great Willow Herb,  <i>Hypericum densiflorum</i>,  Elderberry Sp?,  Silky Willow Bedstraw.  The
Spiraea and Johnswort were in spectacular bloom.  The fen,  which is along beaver
ponds on the stream,  is surrounded by Red Spruce,  Hemlock stands with planted
Red Pine.  We also saw Cat birds in the bush.  No Black Birch? Our hike
downstream ranging from about 3000' asl at the fen and road ended at perhaps
2800' asl at Laurel Fork.  Along the way we noted Pignut in a predominantly
Black Cherry,  Beech,  Sugar Maple forest with abundant,  mostly small Red Spruce The ground cover is dominantly Oxalis with
some <i>Maianthemum </i>canadense,  Mt Holly,  <i>Rhododendron maximum</i>
Striped Maple.  There is scattered Cucumber Magnolia,  and Fraser.  Magnolia seedlings.  were noted.  In seeps <i>Chrysosplenium
americanum </i>was noted.  We heard Wood Thrush and Ovenbirds.  New York Fern is
very abundant ground cover-as well as other ferns.  Again Red Maple occurs
frequently in small numbers. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>Mesic high elevation forest </h3>
<ul>

 

<p>Aug 8 1993 Steve and I survey forest from Laurel Creek
Camp to Beaverdam Run going upstream from FR 14.  The forest along FR 14 at
~3600' asl consists dominantly of open ground mature Sugar Maple,  Beech.  Cherry
with scattered White Ash,  Cucumber and Fraser Magnolia and White Basswood. 
There is much down wood,  some large.  Understory is largely Beech with much New
York Fern and White Snakeroot.  The soil from upturned roots appears to be mull
type,  or at least very good,  corresponding to the White Basswood.  Most Beech leaves appeared to be currled up
as if by drought.  Along the road,  perhaps resulting from limestone gravel there
was very lush H<i>ydrophyllum canadensis</i>.  These observations were made
largely in designated Laurel Fork North Wilderness.  The forest is degraded somewhat with little
downwood.  No Spruce or Hemlock were observed in this forest on either side of
the road. </p>

<p> When we
reached the Beaver Dam Run we hiked upstream along the southeast edge of the
wetland.  We noted the following additional shrubs Choke Cherry  (with abundant
red berries),   <i>Viburnum cassinoides,  Ilex montana,  Ilex verticillata</i> a little Mtn Laurel.  much NY.  Fern,  some Bracken Fern,  planted Red Pine,  We heard and saw  (in air)  Red Shouldered Hawk and scattered Japanese
Beetles*.  There doesn't appear to be any Red Pine reproduction although the
trees here at 3000 ft asl appear to be healthy.  Red Spruce,  which appears to be
reproducing well,  is concentrated around the wetland-as is common,  perhaps due
to adv[spel?] drainage.  I also heard Green Frogs croaking and there were many amphibian
eggs in the beaver ponds.  Red Maple is also common.  A yellow beetle about 1 cm
long is very common and many Black Cherry trees are suffering from a leaf
roller and in some cases completely defoliated with browning hillsides. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>8-15-93 West Dry Branch T. S.  Trip to proposed West Dry
Branch Timber Sale with Steve Krichbaum </h3>
<ul>

 

<p> This
proposal is on both sides Rout 688 that passes between Crawford Mt and Elliot
Knob.   We hiked up West Dry Branch
starting at 688 about a half mile upstream from FR 77.  The forest here is quite
typical of the Valley and Ridge mountain forests at this latitude and about
2000' elevation.  At the start of our hike in a more moist flood plain,  White
Oak and Northern Red Oak dominates.  Chestnut,  Scarlet and Black Oak increase in
the dryer and steeper upstream areas,  and Pitch Pine becomes common.  As usual, 
there are scattered Black Gum and Pignut and in moister areas Black Birch.  White Ash,  Tuliptree.  Black Locust,  Cucumber Magnolia,  a few Basswood (Am?).  Red Maple and White Pine are omnipresent, 
as both overstory and understory.  There is also Hemlock in the moister areas.  The
understory contains White Pine,  Flowering Dogwood Service berry.  Striped Maple,  Witch Hazel.  Northern Red Oak and Pignut seedlings are common and in
some areas White Ash.  There is a little Mt.  Laurel and American Chestnut
sprouts,  some up to 4&quot; in diameter increase upstream.  Stunted Black Cohosh
is scattered and Partridge berry,  Teaberry,  Spotted Wintergreen, <i> Goodyera Aster divaricatus, </i>
Rattlesnake plant[weed] (Hawkweed).  In places and increasing upstream
Blueberry,  Deerberry,  Black Huckleberry increase upstream.  Sassafras and
Hophornbeam and Sycamore also occur. New York and Bracken Fern are common and
Christmas Fern in moister areas.  In some moist areas<i> Potentilla canadensis</i>?
was noted.  A little <i>Menziesia</i> and Maple leaf Viburnum was noted. </p>

<p>We noted one large white Amanita and a vigorous colony of
what I took to be <i>Omphalotus oleanus</i>  (Jack o Lanter)  mushrooms,  the
latter bright orange and both poisonous.  We also noted scattered Gypsy Moth egg
masses with the same tiny Black Flies on them as at home. </p>

<p> We also
noted a seep with Clearplant[weed],  Violets,  sedges,  Cinnamon Fern and an
unknown fern.  </p>

<p> The
White Pine along this stream are young but of quite impressive size and
straightness </p>

<p> A Box
Turtle (Male?) was seen and Vireos and other (unknown) birds were calling. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>8-21,  22-93 Woodlands Institute </h3>
<ul>

<p> Steve and I meet WVHC[West
Va.  Highlands Conservancy] folks at Woodlands Institute and go on field trip
along Big Run near Spruce Knob W Va. </p>

<p><strong>Aug 22</strong> Our first walk was N of the road along western
Branch and along Big Run through mixed second growth northern hardwoods  (Beech
Red Maple,  Birch)  with Spruce and Hemlock,  Red Pine Plantations and open fields.  Along the west branch are many
beaver ponds.  Flat top White Aster <i>A.  umbellatus.  Impatiens capensis</i> and Silky are
prominent in openings.  Under the Pines,  Spruce and Hemlock,  <i>Oxalis montana </i>and
<i>Maianthemum canadense</i> and many ferns are ground cover and also Partridge
Berry.  We noted several Bush Honeysuckle near the road-either <i>L.  tartarica</i>
or <i>L.  canadense</i> w.  red berries Around beaver ponds.  we noted <i>Hypericum mutilum,  Vaccinium
angustifoium,  Chelone glabra</i>,  Oswego tea,  a yellow flowering <i>Hypericum.  </i>I
saw my first ever clump of <i>Gaultheria hispidula</i> on a rotting stump (
photo taken).   Noted many butterflies,  mostly Fritillaries on Goldenrod.  Japanese
Beetles were also common.  Other plants noted were Ninebark,  <i>Menziesia</i>
(little),  Upland Willow.  Ravens were calling. </p>

<p>   .  We then hiked south of the road along
Big Run on an old railroad grade with trees still present.  This is a Birch
(Black and Yellow)-Red Maple-Beech-Black Cherry-Hemlock-Red Spruce [forest]
with increasing amounts of White Ash and Northern Red Oak,  Sugar Maple down stream. 
There are increasing Red Oak seedlings and Beech sprouts and seedlings.  Hawthorn.  Striped Maple,  Service Berry and increasing Mt.  Laurel downstream.  Also increasing Rhododendron[<i>R. </i> <i>maximum</i>]
along the stream.  <i>Vaccinium angustifolium</i> is common,  Some<i> Menziesia</i>
<i>pilosa. </i>.  Ground cover of Partridge
Berry.  <i>Maianthemum canadense</i>.  Lycopods,  A little Mt Maple and <i>Viburnum
alnifolium </i>Alternate-leaf dogwood.  Other plants are <i>Aster divaricatus</i>, 
NY Fern,  a little Christmas Fern.  Carrion
Flower,  a few patches of <i>Goodyera </i>Chickadees,  a large flock of Ruffed Grouse (~
20 birds) and Leopard Frog[probably Pickerel Frog] were noted.  Rocks in the
gorge were dipping fairly steeply toward the east.  A high point was the
discovery of several <i>Habenaria orbiculata</i> orchids (gone to seed) on the
trail.  No magnolias or tuliptrees were seen.  One trillium was seen on the steep
fern-covered slope Also <i>Chrysosplenium americanum</i> was seen in the damp
soil along the trail.  Trout(?) were noted in the stream.  In one place in an
opening what may have been <i>Rudbeckia laciniata</i> was abundant and
spectacular.  Bracken Fern was common along the trail and in openings and <i>Veratrum
viride</i> occurs. ,  </p>

  </ul>
<h3>8-29-93 Black Gap T.  S. </h3>
<ul>

<p> Mike Jones,  Joe Ramsey and I
visited this area on the NW Slope of North Mtn near Longdale Furnace</p>

<p> We drove
up FR 271 from RT 60 along Downy Branch to some upper drainage.  The forest is
dominantly.  typical dry oak forest with
some mesic stands along the stream.  Hemlock much degraded by the Adelgid is
found here with lots of Partridge Berry,  There we[re] also large Tuliptrees,  NY and Christmas Fern in moist spots.  No Striped Maple? White Ash and Cucumber
Magnolias.  Mt Laurel,  Blueberries and
Huckleberries? are common as is Black Gum.  Along Douney Branch we noted a
Salamander.  3 Box Turtles.  remains of Crayfish and lots of small fish.  <i>Aster
divaricatus</i> and much browsed  (Am.  Strawberry?) shrubs.  What we took to be
a Coopers Hawk flew directly in front of our vehicle and Joe later saw a
Barred(?) owl.  </p>

<p> We also
drove there by way of North Mt.  on the FS' &quot;Highlands Scenic tour. &quot;
We noted <i>Eupatorium sessifolium</i>,  Downy Fox Glove,  Canada Moonseed and Bracken Fern ance[spel?] the Table
Mt.  and Pitch Pines,  Black Gum,  Red Maple Mt Fetter Bush.  Mt.  Laurel,  Bear Oak etc of the summit.  A
quite a few birds including some large beautiful native (?) moths along the
stream. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>9-2,  3,  4-93 Blue Bend at Anthony Creek</h3>
<ul>


<p> Anthony Creek cuts through Ridgely SS
upstream and may pick up carbonate.  Trip
with Hoagie to the Blue Bend Campground of the Monongahela NF.  We arrived in
early afternoon and camped at the Blue Meadow (overflow?) Campground.  Hoagie
sketched along Anthony Creek and I botanized.  The upland forest (White Pine, 
Black? Maple.  N Red Oak.  Hemlock,  Musclewood etc) was quite mesic.  I
discovered two colonies of<i> Panax quinquefolius </i>of about 4 plants each, 
each with one mature with berries right in the Campground <i>Hepatica americana</i>
and possibly <i>H acutiloba </i>are common as is Virginia Creeper.  Pileated Woodpeckers and crows were common. 
There are a few small,  much browsed,  Red Spruce trees scattered about,  natural
appearing,  but perhaps planted in the Campground near one colony of Ginseng. 
Also there are several bushes of what may be Fly Honeysuckle  (<i>Lonicera
canadensis</i>)  with European[?] species here.  The clearings here are ringed
with natives and exotics including <i>Discorea</i>[<i>Dioscorea</i>] <i>batatas(</i>?).  <i>Populus gileadensis </i>(?)  (sticky large
aromatic end buds),   Black Walnut<i> Hypericum prolificum.  Vitis</i> spp etc. </p>

<p> Along
Anthony Creek a rich flood plain forest of Sugar Maple,  Red Maple,  Yellow
Buckeye,  Beech,  Tuliptree,  Hemlock,  White Pine,  Rhododendron,  Musclewood,  much
Spice Bush.  This is upstream from our
camp.  Along the stream I notice <i>Cornus amomum</i>,  Ninebark,  L<i>obelia
cardinalis</i> and<i> L siphilitica</i> (both in bloom),  <i>Aster divaricatus</i>
is everywhere abundant,  as is Hollow[stem] Joe Pye Plant[weed],  Horsebalm, 
Sycamore.  Witch Hazel,  Blue Cohosh,  Black Cohosh,  Wingstem,  Viola spp Lopseed. 
A <i>Sedum</i>,  probably<i> S ternatum, </i> is common ground cover in the
forest.  Little or no Partridge
Partridgeberry under Hemlock lec[spel?] Slippery Elm,  Flowering Dogwood and
Northern Red Oak are common Virginia Creeper,  Poison Ivy,  a Sanicle,   Gallium
spp.  White Snakeroot,  Canada Moonseed, 
Shagbark  (practically the only hickory),   Black Locust,  Am.  Basswood and White
Basswood,  Black Cherry,  Japanese Honeysuckle,  Ticktrefoils (spp),  Hawthorn,  Rubus spp,  Clearplant[weed] Sweet Cicely,  Four leaved Yam,  Black Gum.  Golden Ragwort and S<i>enecio obovatus </i>(in
woods).  An unknown bird calling &quot;chep,  chep,  chep&quot; etc was common,  as
were Pileated Woodpecker</p>

<p><strong>(9-3-93)</strong> botanizing along Anthony Creek at at 1850-1900'
asl and downstream from Blue Bend Campground while Hoagie.  painted just below the foot bridge.  The forest
on the flood plain and on the lower mountain slope is very rich mixed mesophyte
with dominating Tuliptree,  Yellow Buckeye,  Sugar Maple,  White Ash,  Beech, 
Shagbark,  Black Birch,  Hemlock,  White Pine,  some of large size although
probably.  not old.  Buckeye was dropping
nuts.  Both American and White Basswood occur and Northern Red Oak is virtually
the only oak,  although White Oak was noted on the slopes.  Slippery Elm,  Black
Cherry,  Black Locust,  Red Maple appear to be minor,  while Sycamore is abundant
along Anthony Creek.  The most common understory tree is Musclewood with minor
Hophornbeam,  Red Bud,  Flowering Dogwood,  Alternate leaved Dogwood,  Witchhazel, 
The only magnolia noted was Cucumber Magnolia.  Spice Bush seemed to be
everywhere and there is minor Striped Maple.  The Hemlock seemed free of Adelgid
here.  Black Elderberry.  occurs in moist
openings.  Partridge Berry is not common under Hemlock but occurs in very lush
colonies on certain banks and scattered locations.  Instead<i> Sedum ternatum</i>
appears to be the most pervasive ground cover in moist,  shady areas.  Spotted
Wintergreen and <i>Goodyera pubescens</i> occur in a few places.  I encountered
Bob Richards of Route 3,  Box 431 Summersville,  West Va. , 26281 who showed me a
leaf of <i>Goodyera repens </i>he had collected from a downstream area along
Anthony Creek.  The slope facing the Stream on the Stream's left side faces at
first west but then more northerly after about a quarter mile below the footbridge. 
This slope is exceedingly rich in moisture and nutrients over thinly bedded
horizontal rock which must have a large Ca / Mg component.  There is a riot of
Hydrangia[spel],  Wingstem and many other plants and ferns <i>Hepatica acutiloba
</i>is very abundant as is <i>Solidago flexicaulis </i>Here at ~1800 ft asl Much spectacular <i>Heuchera
vilosa </i>hangs to steep rocky banks.  In one place there is Mt Maple with lush
<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i> beneath.  <i>Aralia racemosa</i> is more common as is <i>Disporum
lanuginosum</i>  (with red berries).   There is some Bladdernut.  Ferns include
likely Spinulose Shield Fern,  <i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>,  N Y Fern,  Christmas
Fern.  Sensitive Fern,  possible Mt Spleenwort
and spectacular Walking Fern on damp,  vertical rock outcrops.  Only Swallowtail
Butterflies were noted.  Jack in the Pulpit is common.  <i>Laportia canadensis, </i> Horse Balm, 
Lopseed etc.  were common. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>9-9,  10,  11-93 Dolly Sods</h3>
<ul>

<p> Trip with Hoagie to the Red Creek
Campground of Dolly Sods in the Monongahela NF</p>

<p>Spt 9.  We left home
about 10:00 AM on Thursday 9,  and arrived at Dolly Sods early in the afternoon
to somewhat overcast weather.  Hoagie did a water color from a rocky knoll N.  of
Camp while I botanized.  The area is essentially a shrub forest with grassy and
moss lichen openings and clumps of Red Spruce.  The most common shrubs and small
trees are <i>Populus tremuloides P.  grandidentata</i>,  Striped Maples,  Red
Maple,  Yellow Birch <i>Ilex montana, 
Nemopanthus mucrnata.  Alnus rugosa.  </i>Pin Cherry,  Black Cherry,  Service Berry
(sp), <i> Menziesia pilosa, </i> Bear Oak,  <i>Viburnum cassinoides, </i> Upland
Willow Mt Laurel Witchhazel,  <i>Ilex verticillata</i>(?) Hawthorn (Spp) and
Mountain Ash.  Choke cherry may be present I noted what appeared to be several
stunted shrubby Black Gum.  Few <i>Ribes</i>
were seen Also few large Rubus.  Tear
Thumb is common in mesic moist spots<i> Aronia melanocarpa.  Alnus rugosa I. </i> <i>montana,  N mucronata </i>are
particularly common.  Much <i>Menziesia</i> looks as if it's in decline with
many dying bushes.  Low bushes consist mainly of Black Huckleberry and a variety
of Blueberries including <i>Vaccinium angustifolium,  V.  myrtilloides</i>(?) as
well as others  (<i>V.  pallidum</i>?).   Ground cover consists of <i>Gaultheria
procumbens, </i> Trailing Arbutus and particularly of <i>Rubus hispidus</i>.  esp in damp places.  <i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>(?)
is common wherever there is adequate moisture,  even on uplands.  There is also
Glade St Johns Wort in low places and scattered Pitch Pine and Table Mt Pine, 
but very little of these pines.  There is a quite a bit of planted Red Pine but
little or no reproduction. <i> Gentiana linearis</i> is common on both uplands
and bogs as is <i>Aster umbellatus</i>.  This is the height of the berry season
with heavy crops of Huckleberries and Blueberries.  Saw no Sassafras anywhere.  <i>A melanocarpa,  I montana.  N mucronata </i>Cranberries etc.  An interesting and
spectacular plant among the rocks is<i> Dicentra exima, </i> some of which are
still in bloom! Ferns of many types are present,  among which Bracken Fern is
common,  also a soft fern turning brown in the open but still green under trees. 
Golden Rods are common incl <i>Solidago graminifolia.  Leersia oryzoides</i> was noted Tear Thumb
is common in open seeps.  There are 3 ft high conical ant hills that are active. 
Red Squirrels were heard.  Juncos are common.  In moist openings Cotton Sedge is
common.  Only a very little <i>Maianthemum canadense</i> was noted.  The rock is
the widespread conglomeratic sandstone / quartzite weathered to secondary
pebbles in places.  </p>

 

<p><strong>Sept 10</strong> Very hard rain during night with strong wind and
gradual clearing in morning.  Betty[Hoagie] began an oil painting from the same
rock knoll.  I continued to botanize.  I paid a visit to nearby extensive acid
bog[Alder Run Bog] of minimal extent of ~50 acres.  There I chased up an Osprey
which I at first thought was an eagle from its cry.  But its wing profile
against the sky and pattern revealed its true nature.  This bog consists of a
layer of peat perhaps only a few feet thick on its edges over white gravel from
the regional conglomeratic sandstone.  It is edged by Spruce forest with
abundant shrubs and theses shrubs,   mostly <i>Nemopanthus</i> and <i>Alnus
Rugosa</i>[ omit cap. ] extend for a way into the bog.  There are many hummocks, 
some up to 3 ft high which appear to consist of mossy peat and on which shrubs
grow.  Wild Raisin and <i>Aronia melanocarpa </i>also extend into the bog.  A
variety of Blueberries among them <i>V.  angustifolius.  Rubus hispidus</i> and Small(?) Cranberry  (<i>V. 
oxycoccos</i>)(?)[either small or large no positive ident, ] with some Mt Laurel
are common on the bog edge.  In retrospect I think I saw Southern Mtn Cranberry
here also (9-16-94) Only a little <i>Maianthemum canadense</i> was noted.  <i>Gaultheria
procumbens </i>is common as on uplands in dryer spots.  There are also scattered
Red Maple and some few contorted Pitch Pines,  the latter even out in the open
bog.  The bog itself is rich in mosses,  including much sphagnum.  patches of cladonia and many small
Cranberry.  vines,  many with half ripe
cranberries.  In one place I encountered a rich botanical prize <i>Coptis
groenlandic</i>[<i>[Goldthread]</i>,  the first I'd ever seen outside a book!
Betty,  who was sketching at the bog edge some distance away but near the road
found a large,  probably male Black Bear watching her.  The Bear left with a
slight &quot;woof&quot; on seeing her so close! The Goldthread was on the North
side of one of the hummocks well out in the bog.  In some places also there are large patches of a robust sedge out in the
bog.  From photo <i>Carex folliculata </i>(Hunsucker) Also everywhere there is a
low dicot plant <i>Solidago uliginosa</i> (Hunsucker) in clumps with
lanceolate.  glaberous leaves,  well
toothed with edged petioles,  possibly a composite,  but showing no flowers or
seeds.  Another plant I encountered for the first time was <i>Chimaphila
umbellata</i>  (probably not)  or at least what I took to be this plant,  two
thick,  glossy,  serrated leaves on a woody stem with a prominent winter bud
(photo)-also on the N side of a bog hummock-<i>Gentiana linearis</i> is
scattered through the bog. </p>

<p>On our way out we stopped near the fork in the roads
leading to Canaan Valley and to the N Fork Valley.  The elevation here seems
somewhat greater,  perhaps more than 4000' asl.  It is a largely Beech forest
with Yellow Birch,  Black Cherry and Striped Maple.  Clearplant[weed] was lush in
the woods.  Just before we arrived there a beautiful crow-sized Coopers Hawk
flew up and re-perched right at the edge of the road in the dense forest edge. 
The forest here has little ground cover but <i>Oxalis </i>was noted.  Tear Thumb
[w]as also noted.  </p>

  </ul>
<h3>9-25,  26-93 Cranberry Glades</h3>
<ul>

<p> Mike Jones and I went to the
Cranberry Botanical Area (Glades)</p>

<p> We noted
the following additions to Core's tabulation of plants: <i>Lindera benzoin, 
Impatiens</i>(Sp?),  <i>Smilax rotundifolia,  Populus tremuloides,  Maianthemum
canadense,  Laportia canadensis </i>The <i>Impatiens
</i>seemed very scrawny.  Also noted <i>Tilia
americana </i>There also is a long
stemed[spel. ] holly with stems (peduncles) of berries at least.  1. 5 cm long,  This may be Ilex <i>collina</i>,  In the open glade <i>Hypericum virginicum</i> is common and spectacular
with its red seed capsules that resemble,  flower bud[s].  I also heard a Red Shouldered Hawk.  Rain was quite heavy
on the 25,  we having left home in it and it continued till early evening,  but
stopped while we cooked our.  meal at the
Tea Creek Campground.  Additional plants noted at Tea Creek were <i>Rubus
canadensis</i>  (Thornless Blackberry),   one small Tuliptreee at 3000' asl and
a type of Bush Honeysuckle,  possibly <i>Lonicera canadensis </i>from its hairy
leaves.  I also showed Mike the <i>Taxus canadensis </i>upstream along Tea
Creek.  We had some good hikes on the 26 since it cleared and identified C<i>rataegus
punctata</i>.  However no really rare or unusual plants we hadn't seen before
were encountered</p>

  </ul>
<h3>10-2-93 Sherando Lake / Maple Flats</h3>
<ul>

<p> Steve K,  Mike Jones
and I went to Sherando Lake Campground South of Waynesboro and also visited the
Maple Flats botanical area.  We took a short hike along the stream at Sherando
Lake area.  The forest there is fairly typical oak forest with Northern Red Oak, 
Chestnut Oak and White Oak,  Black Gum,  Red Maple,  Sassafras,  Pignut.  White PIne,  Am Chestnut,  Pitch Pine.  No
striped Maple? Mt Laurel,  Blueberries and Maple leaf Viburnum are abundant in
the understory and <i>Gaultheria procumbens </i>Spotted Wintergreen etc.  are common ground
cover.  Partridge Berry is common.   The
more mesic areas,  as along the stream,  have White Ash,  Tuliptree,  Black Birch,  Shagbark,  Beech,  Hemlock  (no
sign of adelgid),   Smooth Alder,  Spice Bush,  Sycamore,  Hydrangia,  Black Elderberry  (in openings) .  Flowering Dogwood,  Serviceberry,  <i>Potentilla</i>
<i>canadensis</i>(?) Witchhazel.  Azalea (
sp?) <i>,  Veronica officianalis</i> are widespread as is <i>Smilax,  Aster
divaricatus</i>.  There are a few Cucumber Magnolia.  Katydids were calling
(unusual in daytime).  We encountered a
large Black Snake and found a salamander in a seep/stream. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>10-8-93 Maple Flats</h3>
<ul>


<p> We then went to Maple Flats which is
a sort of swamp forest in which Red Maple dominates with scattered-some very
large and many dead- Pitch Pines.  Salients of typical oak forest intrude on
elevated areas.  <i>Viburnum dentatum </i>is the dominant shrub but an Azalea
and <i>Vaccinium </i>also are common.  Button Bush is common around and in
permanently flooded areas particularly of the artificial ponds.  A natural round
(sink hole?) pond was surrounded by <i>Ilex verticillata</i> and an Aronia
perhaps <i>melanocarpa </i>Hunsucker identified <i>prunifolia. </i> Patches of
Sphagnum are common as is a recumbent sedge [really] <i>Aneilema keisak. </i>
Tuliptree,  White Oak and Northern Red Oak also occur and there are prominent
patches of <i>Lycopodium obscurum</i>(?) and another-perhaps<i> L. 
flabelliforme</i>(?). <i> Lycopus virginicus</i>(?)[really L.  <i>uniflorus</i>], <i>
Aster lateriflorus </i>Virginia Creeper, 
<i>Ludwigia palustris.  Carex gynandra</i>(?)
and a number of other spectacular sedges,  bulrushes etc occur Also <i>Polygonum
sagittatum.  </i>On exposed mud flats of a dried up artificial
pond occur <i>Hypericum mutilum.  </i>Around the natural pond we noted a number
of small frogs,  one of which was a very small bright green Cricket Frog with
spectacular markings.  We also saw a Ringnecked Snake and a Great Blue Heron
that was planning to fish in a remact[ remnant?] pool loaded with Newts etc in
the artificial pond.  Willows around this pond seemed to be Black Willows.  The
natural pond had a Pondweed lying on the mudflats. </p>

 
<p><strong>Oct 8,  1993</strong> Steve and I visited Maple Flats again. 
Earlier had a card from Hunsucker with the identification of an unknown plant
I'd thought was a sedge.  However it's <i>Aneilema keisak</i> apparently really
disjunct from coastal regions of Va. {probably an alien introduction].  We also identified Possum Haw or <i>Viburnum
nudum</i> and <i>Gaylussacia frondosa </i> (Dangleberry)  for the first time at
the edge of the natural pond.  Royal and Cinnamon Fern are common and Spice Bush
is scattered throughout the swamp forest,  Mockernut Hickory was noted,  On the upland <i>Lespedeza repens </i>and
St Andrews Cross and Black Oak are also common.  In the swampy areas we again
noted many small frogs such as Cricked frogs.  I also noted what appeared to be
an interesting.  Careeprw[spel?Carex?], 
perhaps <i>C rosea</i> in the swamp forest. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>10-15,  16,  17-93 Rendezvous Maple Flats etc</h3>
<ul>

 

<p>Oct 16 Trip to Maple Flats with Hunsucker and others Most
plants here were identified by R.  Hunsucker On the road,  on the way in
Hunsucker identified Fringe Tree.  In the
swamp forest <i>Lycopus uniflorus, </i> <i>Scutellaria integrifolium,  Rubus
hispidus,  Lobelia cardinalis, </i> Honey Mushroom,  <i>Vaccinium corymbosum.  Viburnum</i> <i>nudum,  Aronia arbutifolia, 
Aronia floribunda</i> (Red) or (<i>Aronia prunifolia) </i>  (Blue black),   <i>Viola
primulifolia.  Viburnum cassinoides,  Carex
intumescens</i>,  a cotton scale prey of carnivorous Harvester Butterfly,  <i>Fontinallis</i>
moss,  <i>Woodwardia virginica</i> (a fern)   (around small sinkhole pond)  <i>Salvia
urticifolia, </i> <i>Habenaria clavellata,  Linum striatum.  Parthenium integrifolium, </i> much <i>Aneilema
keisak,  Ilex verticillata.  Aster dumosus, 
A lateriflorus,  Seriocarpus asterioides</i>  (<i>Aster paternus</i>)  <i>Eleocharus
acicularis</i> is dominant mat-forming spike rush on dried artificial pond.  <i>Proserpinaca
pectinata</i>.  [Comb-leaved Mermaid Weed]
is common on this surface as is <i>Hypericum mutilum,  Panicum boscii,  P dichomiflorum.  Erechtites hieracifolia,  Deschampsia</i> sp?
I don't remember any Hawthorn.  There's
lots of Spice Bush</p>

<p> Many
small frogs (Cricket,  <i>Hyla </i>etc/)  hopped in the wooded swamp and
literally hundreds into the waterof the small sink hole pond. </p>
 

<p> Later we
hiked farther from the road on a &quot;woods road&quot; 1/6 mile W of the pond
area.  This led to a larger,  partly dry sinkhole pond with little vegetation but
many encroaching Pin Oaks.  On the upland road leading to this pond we noted <i>Aster
linarifolius</i>  (Stiff Aster),   <i>Ascyrum hypericoides </i> (Andrew's Cross
)  (variety <i>multicaule</i>),   <i>Tephrosia virginiana </i> (legume) </p>

  </ul>
<h3>Oct 17,  1993 Bald Mtn [to] Green Pond</h3>
<ul>

<p> (Most plants
identified by R.  Hunsucker) </p>

<p>Hike to Green Pond with Hunsucker and others from Bald
Mtn Overlook on Parkway.  We noted that although there were many dead oaks due
to the Moth,  apparently there were few Moths the past season since many oaks
had full leaves (none had skeletal or new[spel?] leaves,  that is late season
leaves) and many appear to be recovering.  Also the bright colors revealed the
true abundance of Black Gum in this area.  Species noted on the trail were: <i>Aster
macrophyllus Aster acuminatus, </i> <i>Aster cordifo;ius,  Aster puniceus,  Aster
pilosus.  Aster leavis </i>[ * note none
of these Asters appear at Maple Flats], <i> Aralia nudicaulis,  Ilex montana, 
Oxalis stricta</i>? <i>Aureolaria virginica </i>(Yellow False Foxglove)  (or
flava ?),  Stary Campion  (in bloom),  <i>Helianthus strumosus,  Thaspium barbinode
Orysopsis</i>  (rice grass sp?).  Scarlet Oak, (here at ~3000' asl).  A Wood Frog,  <i>Muhlenbergia </i>(grass)(sp?), 
<i>Deschampsia</i>(grass sp?) <i>Hypnum gentionoides</i>,  At the Pond
identified(Hunsucker did as with most of the others).  &quot;Three Way Sedge&quot;  (<i>Dulichium
arundinaceum </i>).  <i>Hypericum
virginicum</i>,  Button bush.  <i><u>Lycopodium obscurum</u></i> present No Hawthorn ?,  Apparently the <i>Rhododendron </i>at the Pond edge and elsewhere here
is R <i>catawbiensis</i> ! as pointed out by Hunsucker who here taught me how
to distinguish it ! Some of us saw a beautiful large falcon fly directly over
the Pond (which is dry).  This was
probably a Peregrine Falcon.  We also saw a beautiful American Toad.  There were
a few very large Cranberries on the vines of the<i> Vaccinium macrocarpon</i>[
really planted !]<i> </i>here on one of its few locations in this part of
Virginia.  On dry areas of the trail we also noted &quot;Indian tobacco&quot;
which I tasted to my regret! (<i>Lobelia inflata</i>)</p>

<p>10-24-93 Stony Man and Hawks
Bill Trip was with Steve K and Mike J to the tops of Stony Man and Hawks bill
Mtns in Shenandoah N P.  The forest on
both peaks appears to be dominantly Northern Red Oak with substantial amounts
of Yellow Birch and White Oak and lesser amounts of Black Birch,  Red Maple, 
Sugar Maple.  White Ash,  Black Cherry, 
Black Locust,  White? and American Basswood,  Pignut,  Hemlock and Balsam Fir, 
American Chestnut (sprouts),  Red Spruce,  Black Gum.  Smaller trees are Striped Maple, 
Hophornbeam.  Mt.  Ash hawthorns,  Witchazel,  Mt Laurel,  <i>Ilex
montana</i> Bear Oak.  <i>Menziesia </i>(one bush),  Mapleleaf Viburnum.  Various <i>Rubus </i>canes were noted (sp?). 
Fly Poison is common as is Wood Betony.  There are scattered Blueberries and
Huckleberries,  <i>Dryopteris marginalis</i> ?,  <i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>,  Indian Tobacco (<i>Lobelia inflata)</i>, <i>
Aronia melanocarpa</i> (vemp[ spel?] oaks),  <i>Ribes</i> (sp?), <i> Heuchera</i>
(Sp?),  <i>Asarum canadense</i>,  Baneberry,  Christmas Fern (little) A
samely[spel?] umbelliferous.  plant that
grows to 4' tall is very common.  It is<i> Ligustrum canadense</i>  (confirmed
by R H) .  Does White Oak go to top?</p>

<p>  On top of exposed peak,  we found berry clusters of <i>Maianthemum
canadense </i>and in rock crevices,  <i>Saxifraga michauxii </i>on both peaks
and in addition<i> Potentilla tridentata</i> with winter leaf rosettes.  On top
there are many dead and damaged oaks prsumably from the Gypsy Moth,  but we saw
little sign of the latter and the seasons leaves appeared intact.  Hemlock
showed no sign of the edelgid[spel. ]The Balsam Fir appears to be reproducing if
2' high trees are evidence.  However deer browsing is probably severely
restricting reproduction since it's severe at about 3800' asl but less severe
at 4000 asl.  Fir also.  shows browsing at
a few twig ends on the Valley side exposed to NW winds here,  We also saw a
millipede and a white Butterfly. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>11-8-93 Rocky Row and Turtle Salvages</h3>
<ul>


<p>  Rocky Row &lt; 1000' asl</p>

<p>Steve k,  Marti Kovacs and I went to look at proposed
Southern Pine Beetle salvage timber sale</p>

<p>The Rocky Row and
Turtle Salvages.  The weather was very
cool and clear</p>

<p>The Rocky Row Site is NW of and on the slopes above Rocky
Row Run.  a small fish-bearing stream with
Beech and Hemlock and White Pine.  <i>Hexastylis </i>(sp?) Also Partridge Berry
Hepatica Americana Christmas Fern<i> Rhododendron catawbiense</i>.  Slippery Elm Smooth Alder,  Witch[h]azel.  Tuliptree,  Northern Red and.  White Oak along it.  Slopes above are rich in
Virginia,  Table Mtn.  Pitch and White
Pine.  Elevation is 1000 ft asl or lower.  The Pine Beetle has killed many trees
S E of the Stream on the high gorge walls,  Mt Laurel is common everywhere and Scarlet Oak,  Chestnut Oak,  Black
Locust,  Black Birch,  Cucumber Magnolia and Sycamore,  the last three chiefly
along streams in coves,  are common.  A
large clearcut has much Tree of Heaven sprouting and<i> Cunila origanoides </i>(
Wild Marjoram)  from little shrubby clumps at the clearcut edge.  No Striped Maples.  Red Maple is scattered throughout but no
Striped Maple or Mt.  Maple were noted Also we saw no White Ash.  The Hemlock is quite heavily infected by the
Adelgid.  However no sign of the Gypsy
Moth was noted. </p>

<p> We also
hiked along the ATV trail which begins at a parking lot on Forest Road 319 near
the Blue Ridge Parkway and leads to the so-called Turtle Salvage The banks
along this trail are very rich in <i>Galax </i>and <i>Hexastylis</i>.  At the
proposed salvage site on a low ridge above a stream there are many killed
(presumably by Pine Beetle)  pines,  mostly Pitch Pine but also some small White
Pine also killed perhaps because they were suppressed beneath larger unaffected
White Pine.  Other important trees.  here
are Scarlet and Red Oak,  some Red Maple,  Mt Laurel is common as is a Blueberry,  also Chestnut Oak.  There was no
sign of the Gypsy Moth.  however many large Hemlock appear near death from the
Adelgid,  This insect has also defoliated many small Hemlock and no untouched
areas were seen. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>11-14-93 Browns Gap in Shenandoah National Park</h3>
<ul>

<p>  Steve K and I rendezvoused at Browns Gap in
Shenandoah NP with Joe Ramsey.  We hiked down Madison Run Road to the trail to the
Big Run Loop Trail and returned on it to the AT[Appalachian Trail] of Parkway
and thence to our cars.  The upland parts of these trails is through elevation
2600' dry mostly chestnut and scarlet oak forest with a fair sprinkling of
Pitch and Table Mt Pine and some Short leaf(?) pine(we are still having a time
distinguishing this from Pitch Pine!).  There is also Northern Red Oak and a
quite a bit of American Chestnut which seems to be benefting[spel. ] from Gypsy
Moth killing of overstory oaks.  The mortality from the Moth is severe throughout
most of the forest where oaks dominate and many Yellow Pines have also been
killed by the Southern Pine Beetle.  Bear gorge on Poke! In some places a lush
growth of Poke has also resulted and Bears have been eating great quantities of
Poke berries-as seen from abundant droppings.  We also saw a very colorful
butterfly.  This may have been Greek Comma (<i>Polygonia flavous</i>[ spel?]) 
which feeds on Black Birch [ no data found on this or this butterfly name ]
Other understory species are Mt Laurel and Striped Maple at least at higher
elevations.  There is also abundant Blueberry,  elevation~ 1600' asl.  At lower
elevations near the stream Tuliptree,  Black Birch,  Shagbark Hickory,  Pignut
Hickory.  White Ash,  Red Maple,  White Oak, 
Northern Red Oak and White Pine are abundant.  White Pine is also experiencing a
surge due to the death of large White and Northern Red Oaks by the Moth.  There
are only a few Hemlocks and these are suffering from the Adelgid.  There also
some dying Black Locust,  some Flowering Dogwood,  Black Gum.  Sycamore is common
along the stream as is Smooth Alder and Witchhazel along the banks.  There are
few Moth egg masses or sign of damage this year.  Near a large Tuliptree in the
stream cove we saw a large,  beautiful American(?) Toad and on the hike back
along the Parkway I saw what appeared to be a large falcon.  Also two Ruffed
Grouse flew out of the tops of tall oaks where they apparently perched for the
night-which was unexpected.  Near the start of our hike we also noted a
spectacular Bittersweet[probably the alien species] vine and on the way back<i>
Lyonia ligustrina</i>,  but in a very dry situation in ericaceous oak forest. 
The weather was quite warm and slightly cloudy,  quite a pleasant hike although
I experienced some difficulty keeping up on the steep Big Run Loop
section-getting old but far from quitting!</p>

  </ul>
<h3>12-4-93 Charlie Sullivan and Friends.  Meet with Charlie at Ramseys Draft</h3>
<ul>

 

<p>Steve and I met Charlie Sullivan and six of his Hemlock
Center colleagues at Ramseys Draft.  Noted
abundant Partridge Berry and Speedwell (<i>Veronica officianalis </i>) in the
area,  the former mostly under Hemlock but also on the woods edge in close
proximity to the Speedwell.  Also noted Water Starwort in pools near the stream. 
The stream was quite strong.  We took a side trip to Signal Corps Knob and
visited the classic &quot;maple&quot; clearcut,  shelterwood and the
&quot;prescribed burn&quot; that got out of hand.  As we left this area and
returned to the Draft rain began and was falling quite strongly as we sat
around a fire near erected tents.  We[Steve and I] left in the dark and returned
to Staunton to eat in the Mexican restaurant. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>12-19-93 Marble Valley / Clayton Mill Springs</h3>
<ul>

<p> Trip to proposed Marble Valley Timber Sale
and the included Clayton Mill Spring Special Interest Area with Steve K and his
friends that live near the area.  We noted that the main stream,  which the road
follows disappears below its bed for several hundred yards and then reappears. 
From this stream we walked NW along an old woods road that borders the #4
cutting unit (proposed).  On the left,  less than 100 ft from this old road lies
a major branch of the spring but which lies atride[astride?] the 37 acre SIA.  White
Pine,  Hemlock.  White Oak.  Chestnut Oak,  Northern Red Oak,  ScarletOak,  Black Oak,  Pignut.  Black Birch,  Black Gum,  Tuliptree are abundant along this road and stream as is
PartridgeBerry,  Spotted Wintergreen,  Flowering Dogwood,  teaberry,  Red Maple, <i>
Goodyera </i>There is some Spice
bush.  along the stream and Catawba
Rhododendron.  Mt Laurel is abundant,  mostly along the stream.  We also saw some
Shortleaf Pine(?) and Pitch Pine is fairly common.  Christmas Fern,  <i>Asplenium
platyneuron.  Dropteris Goldiana </i>were
noted.  Cucumber Magnolia was noted also.  In some places lycopodium is common. 
CobbleStones in the stream area are covered with moss and in some cases by <i>Bazzania</i>
(<i>trilobata</i>?).  In many places there are considerable Mitella intergrown
with the moss and liverwort on the rocks,  In one place I noted what may be American Waterpennywort.  Only scattered Gypsy Moth egg masses were
noted.  The above observations also apply to vegetation within the SIA.  Some
Mockernut was also noted. </p>

  </ul>
<h3>2-6-94 Marble Valley T. S.   </h3>
<ul>
<p>Trip to proposed Marble Valley
Timber Sale area and particularly the Clayton Mill Spring SIA with Steve and
his two friends. </p>

<p>We hiked up stream along the main stream leading from the
Spring  (the eastern most branch)  to where a diversion occurs toward the south
and splits the main flow I noted a few Beech trees.  Several noisy Pileated Wood
Pecker,  a large stick nest high in a White Pine next to the trunk.  As we ate I
noted a tiny cloud of tiny  (gnat sized)  insects with Mayfly courting behavior
next to a small moss-covered boulder in the stream. </p>

<p>Next we hiked to the more temporary stream which flows
into the main stream below the high bluffs to the east.  We noted a very few
Gypsy Moth egg masses and a Walking Fern on a large rock.  In this area I also identified a White
Basswood  (multiple sprouts) .  Up this
intermittent stream,  which flows underground at intervals,  we noted many Black
Birch,  Tuliptree.  many fine Pignuts, 
Black,  Scarlet,  Chestnut and White Oaks with a few White Pine and Hemlock.  Also
some Northern Red Oak, .  Flowering
Dogwood,  Mt Laurel,  Spice Bush,  Red Maple are also common along the stream. 
Near where this stream joins the main branch there is a sinkhole surrounded by
richer soils with Black Walnut Va Junipers,  lush herbaceous growth</p>
