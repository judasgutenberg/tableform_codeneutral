 <h3>4-5-94 Blowing Springs </h3>
<ul>




Trip by Hoagie[the writer's wife] and me to Blowing Springs
Hoagie started two splendid paintings of the
falls of Back Creek-now "Arborvitae Falls"-in flood and I botanized
discovering Arborvitae for the first time. 
<p/> Along the River Trail noted a quite a few Yellow Trout
Lilies in bloom and later in the day a few Bloodroot
<i>Veronica officinalis</i> fairly
common.
<i>Sedum ternatum </i>is common
but I saw no partridgeberry even under Hemlock Violets were just emerging
Some snowbanks still remained on the steep
bank below the north-facing cliffs. I found a PH=5 for the stream and pH=5.5
for a seep dripping through leaves
Garlic Mustard was also emerging plentifully along the Trail
<i>Potentilla canadensis</i>(?) fairly common
on trail. <i>Rhododendron maximum </i>is scattered throughout. There was also
some Rue anemony[spel.] flowering on banks. A deep olive green sphagnum like
moss is very common on the ground and a number of mosses were putting out new
sporophytes. Also noted large green Horsetails The prevalent rock in the area
appears to be a cross bedded honeycombed sandstone, probably with calcareous
cement that encourages the abundant lime-loving plants. Also noted a few
Spotted Wintergreen and a colony of what appears to be <i>Tipularia discolor</i>.
At one point I noted Beavers had cut trees
10" in diameter into one foot lengths and barked them. I also noted
Ravens,[ apparently nesting on a high (300')[cliff] since I observed them
landing on a ledge. Only a few small birds were noted perhaps including a
Yellow Rumped Warbler, but that only heard. In all, a great day!


 
 <p/>
</ul><h3>4-10-94 Blowing Springs </h3>
<ul>

 
Steve K. and I stopped off at Blowing Springs on our way from looking at
the
Five Wood T.S. Area again. I noted
Spring Beauty (<i> Claytonia virginica</i>)  in bloom
also Dutchmans Breeches (in bloom also).
Noted Walking Fern on Rock and <i>Trillium</i>(sp?) very abundant. Also a <i>Heuchera
</i>in bloom. <i>Dryopteris marginalis </i>is an abundant fern. In one place we
saw a vigorous stand of young <i>Aralia spinosa </i>in an old "wildlife
opening" where Autumn olive had been planted and severely browsed by
Beaver.
I also noted Scouring Rush <i> Equisetum hyemale</i> growing on the stream
bank. Also noted a large Black Gum
We
saw a pair of wild ducks  (mallard ?)  fly up from the stream. A little snow
still remained,mostly in leaf covered banks. The stream ran high as lasttime.
Light rain fell.

 <p/>
</ul><h3>4-10-94 Fivewood TS
Allegheny Mtn </h3>
<ul>


 
Visit by Steve and I to
proposed Five Wood Timber Sale Area on Allegheny Mtn. We hiked down FDR 6007[?]
from the end of FDR 6003 near the Va Power Gate down to the stream and hiked to
the gauging station downstream
The
entire area is dominated by Northern Red Oak. A few snowbanks still remained
along the road at ~3200' elevation. At these elevations we also noted Hemlock,
American Basswood, Black Locust, Yellow Birch, Black Birch, Shagbark
Pignut
Cucumber Magnolia
Sugar Maple,
Red Maple  (very abundant),  Black Cherry, White Oak, Chestnut Oak. Along the
stream, White Oak, Shagbark become common and there are Beech and some White
Ash, a few Sycamore. We noted only a few Tuliptree here at about 2600'
elevation
The entire area seems quite
acidic and not strongly mesic even near the stream. Trout Lily  (yellow? } is
very common. A yellow violet and considerable Partridge Berry were noted.
Christmas Fern is common. A few Black Oak were noted.<i> Potentilla canadensis</i>
is common as is a <i>Gallium</i>[spel] and probably several <i>Dentaria</i>(?).
<i>Hepatica americana</i> is fairly common. White Pine occurs mostly on the
lower slopes and ridges. An impressive Beaver Pond is on the stream. Its waters
are clear with little or no shrubs or herbs growing along its banks, perhaps
due to the acidic conditions. Although we noted amphibian eggs  (clumps) 
probably salamander, in a small adjacent pond in the flood plain. I thought I
heard
vireos and warblers and we saw
what appeared to be swallows circling above an artificial pond near a vertical
cliff. 



 <p/>
</ul><h3>4-17-94 Dabney T.S. Area </h3>
<ul>


 
 
Fore Mtn  (Fine Sunny day)  Steve
and I visited the Sale Area. We drove to
the area on FDR 337 to the project boundary just upslope from Dabney
La[n]caster Community College, and walked into the area. The area seems
dominated by Northern Red Oak, with White Oak, Scarlet Oak, Chestnut Oak and
some Black Oak. Tuliptree is common along the road and in concavities
Red Maple, Pignut Hickory, a little Mockernut
Hickory
Some BlackBirch. Flowering
Dogwood and Redbud are common. Virginia, Shortleaf
Pitch and Table Mt. Pines with a little White
Pine were noted. <i>Coreopsis major</i> occurs along the road. Mt Laurel also
occurs
Trout Lily was noted in moist
areas. Grape vines are common. A 16 yr old clearcut was dominated by Tuliptree,
Black Locust, Red Maple, Black Gum
Sassafras, some Hickory regeneration. Some Staghorn Sumac, <i>Iris
cristata</i>, Halbert[spel]-leaved Violet occurred in this clearcut. A little
Striped Maple was noted. Some areas contain fine old or at least large old
trees- Northern Red, Chestnut and White Oak. Some American Chestnut occurs. It
was noted again that ~100 yr old oak  (by ring count)  had no sprouts We also
saw a hawk, possibly an accipiter  (Coopers?)  and abundant vultures  (Turkey?) Blackberry is common in the old clearcuts
In some places the soil is very sandy and usually there is only mohr
layer~3" thick above the sand.


 <p/>
</ul><h3>4-18-94 w. Hoagie to
Blowing Springs Blowing Springs </h3>
<ul>




 again with Hoagie
She almost completed the falls painting  (oil) and worked on watercolors. I noted snowbanks still present below the N facing
cliff. <i>Trillium grandiflorum </i>and <i>Trillium erectum </i> a Phlox  (<i>divaricata</i> or <i>stolonifera</i>), <i>Viola palens</i> (?), <i>Dentaria laciniata
Stellaria pubera,</i> <i>Maianthemum
canadense</i>(?)
<i>Euonymus
atropurpurea</i>  (Wahoo)  <i>Mitella</i> <i>diphylla</i>. The <i>Tipularia
discolor </i>still had its winter leaves, Also <i>Houstonia caerulea </i> Coltsfoot and dandelions common. Hoagie saw a
Hawk. Vultures were common and I noted several species of warblers(?) in the
treetops



 <p/>
</ul><h3>4-23-94 Maple Flats</h3>
<ul>


Mike
Jones and I went to Maple Flats were[spel] we hiked extensively, found
lots
of sinkhole ponds and got lost
We finally found our way to the road by
following old woods roads that led toward the mountain peaks. Noted lots of <i>Lycopodium
obscurum</i>, Blue violets with tall flower stems, small white violets, some <i>Iris
cristata </i> many Cinnamon Ferns in the
fiddlehead stage. Many<i> Uvularia sessi</i>[l]<i>ifolia</i>, a few scattered
small Hemlock and Chinkapin.
Pink Azalea
(<i> Rhododendron nudiflorum </i>) is common. Tow[h]ee calls were common and I
chased two ducks  (Woodduck?)  out of a sinkhole pond that contained many
shrubs throughout its extent. Also noted a quite a few <i>Botrichium oneidense</i>
in one area. There were scattered Gypsy Moth egg masses, punctured by the usual
small holes  (parasite?).  The masses didn't seem to have any viable eggs in
them. Also, the oaks  (White, red, Chestnut, Black) seem to be putting out a
healthy growth of new leaves although they have in places lost limbs and had
considerable mortality. Also, as observed in previous trips the area of
wetlands have large amounts of large dead Pitch Pines in some sections. These
have begun to fall enhancing the habitat. We failed to see any Swamp Pink
despite a careful search. In the sinkhole ponds we noted what appeared to be
lush Water Moss near the shore. Small cricket Frogs seemed common also.

 <p/>
</ul><h3>4-30-94 Ramsey's Draft and
Signal Corps Knob</h3>
<ul>



 
I met Mike Jones and 7
U Va students at Ramseys Draft Wilderness parking lot. We did a botanical walk
into the Wilderness where we observed such rarities as Panax trifolius good
colonies of Maianthemum canadense under Hemlock  (much plagued by Adelgids) 
with Patridge Berries, Hepatica americana
Wood  (or "Mountain")  Anemony[spel.]. In more mesic areas the
Panax trifolius Viola pensylvanica
Geranium maculatum, a Trillium (sp?), Aster divaricatus Miterwort
scattered throughout, Sweet Cicely in mesic area. Gaywings in more acidic
areas. Veronica officinalis is very common (?) here
Blackhaw Viburnum in good soil. I saw a  (very close)  Blackburnian(?) Warbler, heard first Scarlet Tanager of the year. Later
we saw-and heard-another on Signal Corps Knob
I also heard first Red eyed Virio[spel] of the year. We discussed FS
management particularly with respect to regeneration in the Signal Corps
clearcut.
<p/>
At Ramseys Draft we also noted efts of the Newt emerging
from small ponds in the woods 

 <p/>
</ul><h3>5-3-94 w. Hoagie to
Ramsey's Draft</h3>
<ul>


 
Hoagie and I returned to
Ramseys Draft, she to paint and I to botanize. The weather was cool, somewhat
windy and gradually clouding over  (followed by rain in evening after we left
the Draft)  The high point of my visit was finding a small colony of Starflower
(<i>Trientalis borealis</i>)  here at about 2300 feet asl under a Hemlock in
very rocky  (red sandstone) [soil] near the gorge wall. Another northern
species noted was Red Elderberry in bloom. <i>Potentilla canadensis</i>,
Partridge Berry, teaberry
Gaywings
Mt Laurel <i>Maianthemum canadense</i> and
mosses form colonies of association under Hemlock, White Pine, Shagbark
Sycamore. White Oak, Sugar Maple
Black Birch and other trees. <i>Aster
divaricatus</i> is very abundant here
In
less acid areas Coralberry thrives as do a great variety of wild flowers and
herbaceous species. Identified are <i>Viola rostrata </i> (Longspurred violet) 
which is very abundant, Virginia Saxifrage, <i>Asarum canadense</i>, <i>Osmunda
claytoniana</i>  (Interrupted Fern),  <i>Disporum lanuginosum,</i> <i>Senecio
aureus
Gallium</i>'spel.] <i>circaezans</i>
 (Wild Licorice).  I identified for the first time the rush <i>Luzula acuminata
</i>with fair confidence. A number of alien species such as<i> Yucca
filamentosa</i> and <i>Veronica</i> <i>arvensis </i>were noted. Along the
stream in shingle I saw my first <i>Hypericum punctatum </i>and in one place
two small patches of an oxalis which may have have been <i>O montana</i>(?)
From its characteristics the wild strawberry
present here appears to be <i>Fragaria vesca</i> with its flowers extending far
above the leaves. This may be in error It may be <i>F vesca </i> Yes! it was! [???] <i>Houstonia caerulea </i>is
scattered widely in lush patches. Scarlet Tanagers were heard as were
Kingfishers. In one place where Hoagie was painting, there were water filled
depressions in the rock. Some of them had many small pollywogs and Pollywogs
were also present in the stream nearby. In one place I also noted a large  (body length 1.5 cm)  Mayfly in a bush.


 <p/>
</ul><h3>5-10-94 w. Hoagie to
Ramsey's Draft</h3>
<ul>



 
Hoagie and I
returned
to Ramsey's Draft. There I saw
a low, white Pink  (<i>Silene pennsylvanica</i>?) possibly <i>Dryopteris
goldiana, Ranuculus abortivus</i>, Sensitive Fern, <i>Arabis laevigata.
Arisaemus triphyllum</i> is common as is Dutchmans Pipe  (<i>Aristolochia
macrophylla </i>) <i>Hydrangea arborescens</i> occurs.<i> Tilia Americana</i>
is the observed basswood, Flowering Dogwood, Poison Ivy and Virginia Creeper
are common as is Striped Maple. I also saw a yellow Swallowtail Butterfly, a
high-flying Hawk, vultures and heard warblers and tanagers and vireos.
<p/>
Beneath Hemlocks I noted large, round, deep green, thickish
and hair[y] leaves which Hunsucker told me are <i>Viola rotundifolia</i>. These
leaves are "appressed to the ground" as S&C state.


 <p/>
</ul><h3>5-13,14,15-94 Steel Bridge
Rendezvous Potts Creek=Peters Mountain excursion</h3>
<ul>



  VFW/ CABP{Central Appalachian
Biodiversity Project] Rendezvous at the Steel Bridge Campground in the
Jefferson National Forest. We had field trip with Rober[t] Hunsucker to Potts
Mtn and Peters Mtn and along Potts Creek near the Campground. Steve Krichbaum
and I started it off on the 13 by a preliminary trip to the top of Peters Mtn
trying to get to a special management area designated by the Jefferson. We
returned to this area with Hunsucker and others
on Sunday the 15th. We reached this area by
driving up RT 311 and turning on to the Forest Road
We walked up a logging road to a large
Shelterwood(?) cut at the 3000 ft level and from there clim[b]ed to the top on
really[spel?] to the 3400 ft level near the top. The area examined is just NE of
the large rectangular block of private land that abuts on the
Va-West Va boundary. The forest is fairly
common upland oak forest
with much
Chestnut Oak. White Oak appears to increase upward as does Striped Maple while
Chestnut Oak diminishes. There are many Chestnut sprouts and Sourwood is
common. Pignut is common. Black Birch is common on rough talus slopes. Virginia
Creeper is very common. Pink Azalea is common at all levels as is Galax.
Near the mountain top the Chestnut Oak becomes quite conterted and there
is much coarese woody debris in the form of down trees of all ages ages and
states of aging, Plants encountered along the logging road on the way up
include<i> Senecio smallii, Hypericum stranulum</i>  (St. Andews Cross)  a <i>Linum</i>
sp?,
<i>Salvia lyrata, Chrysanthemum
leucanthemum</i>  (Ox-eye Daisy).  In one place under a rock we found a
millipede that smelled strongly
of
Bitter Almond and Red backed Salamander. A Box Turtle was near by. Deer Berry, <i>Vaccinium
pallidum </i>and Bracken Fern are present at all levels. Higher
we noted scattered <i>Angelica venenosa</i>.
The light green
Cushion Moss, <i>Leucobryum
</i>sp? is found at the base of certain trees>Along this road on the 15th we
saw the most brilliant Scarlet Tanager I ever saw. Near the top of the
Mountain, perhaps at 3400 ft, we encountered a series of springs. The forest in
this vicinity consists of White Oak
Northern
Red Oak, Chestnut Oak, Black Gum, red Maple
Black Birch, Pitch Pine, Service berry (sp?).  Toward the springs <i>Vaccinium
corymbosum</i>  (tall Blueberry)  increases in frequency and size till its very
abundant and rich at the Springs. Pink Azalea  (<i>R nudiflorum </i>) being
worked by large Bumble bees  (Queens ?) occurs, as does <i>Menziesia pilosa</i>
 (Min[n]iebush) 
Immediately at the
springs there is <i>Viburnum cassinoides </i> (Wild Raisin)  just beginning to
form flower buds. Mt Laurel is also common as is Witchhazel and there is some
Smooth Alder. Also noted small <i>Aronia</i>? plants at spring area
On the Spring edges grow <i>Maianthemum
canadense
Chelone glabra </i>(not yet
even forming flower buds),  Star Flower, Indian Cucumberroot and in the wettest
areas a <i>Glyceria </i>sp  (grass), <i> Parnassia asarifolia, Carex leptalea</i>
and abundant Sphagnum Moss  (this <i>Carex </i>also occurs in Folly Mills
calcareous
fen showing a great range of
pH tolerance!)  A Pickerel Frog was noted in the Spring area There are two main
springs in the area we visited at the NE edge of the private land<i> Scirpus
verecundus </i> <i>Mitrola pandura</i>[??]
(mushroom)  Also Cinnamon Fern
Ruffed
Grouse flew up and Black throated Blue Warblers sang, A <i>Gyrinophilus</i> sp
[salamander]? was noted. At lower elevation, at about 3000 ft, in the forest
and on the edge, we noted Rose Breasted Grossbeaks and on the way down noted a
pigeon-sized accipiter, probably a Coopers Hawk,  fly over low above our heads
in the cut. Many Crested Flycatchercalls were heard and both male and female
Scarlet Tanagers seen.
<p/>Along Potts Creek at

</ul><h3>May 14, 1994 Potts Mtn
Pond Road</h3>
<ul>



 * (see also our previous 6-28-93 visit here)  Potts
Mtn trip led by Hunsucker
<p/>Our walk began from Forest
Rd 176 and followed a "jeep trail" leading NE along the edge of
Barbours Creek Wilderness to the Pond. The beginning is at about 3400' asl in
Upland Oak forest. There we saw <i>Convallaria montana</i>, I for the first
time. Along
the first part of the trail,
which climbs to 3600' asl we noted much Chestnut Oak,<i> Coreopsis</i> <i>major</i>,
<i>Viola pedata</i> of many colors and large flower sizes, <i>Aralia</i> <i>nudicaulis,
Rhododendron roseum</i>
Beaked Hazelnut,
<i>Paronychia</i> <i>canadensis, Uvularia pudica, Ranunculus abortivus,</i>
Ebony Spleenwort, <i>Vaccinium pallidum, Iris verna</i>  (no smell to me!) 
Yellow Star Grass, <i>Viola fimbriatula,</i> Pink Azalea, Pink Moccasinflower,
Fly Poison, Cinnamon Fern  (in sprig area),  <i>Amelanchier arborea </i>(?)
<i>Oryzopsis racemosa, </i>Habert[spel.]
leaved Violet. No Partridge Berry ? We saw Juncos.  At ~3600' asl Chestnut Oak
practically drops out but Black, Scarlet and Northern Red Oak become prominent
as does White Oak. At the Pond Northern Red and White Oak dominate. Cinnamon
Fern, Aronia, Wild Raisin, <i>Maianthemum canadense, Ilex verticillata, </i>Min[n]iebush,
<i>Rubus hispidus</i> are abundant. Also many <i>Trillium undulatum </i> (Painted Trillium)  were in beautiful bloom among the Sphagnum and numerous
Blueberry bushes. <i>Convallaria</i> also occurs here as does Fly Poison and <i>Stellaria
pubera</i>  (Rattlesnake Hawkweed, Southern Hairbell  (not in bloom). <i>Prenanthes
trifoliata </i>is common. There were many tadpoles in the Pond and we noted a
Four toed Salamander with white belly with black spots under woody debris.
Great Crested Flycatchers seemed abundant in
the Pond area as were
Blackflies. The
largest <i>Polygonatum biflorum</i>  (Solomans seal)  I ever saw
occurs here with what may be <i>Veratrum
parviflorum</i>  (<i>Melanthium</i> <i>parviflorum</i> or Bunch Flower)  We
also heard a Peeper call and heard several
Tanagers Several of our group hiked farther along the road to "The
Stocks" where they saw Butternut, Mountain Ash and Red Elderberry and Michaux's
Saxifrage. On our return to the cars we heard Rosebreasted Grossbeaks call.
<p/>
More on Potts Mtn Pond from Hunsucker  (5-21-94)  <i>Carex
canescens </i>and <i>Carex stricta</i> in Pond,<i> Vaccinium angustifolium
V constablaei </i> (hexapolar hybrid),  <i>Prenanthes
trifoliata
Viola sagittata, Hieracium
gronovi</i>  (Hairy Hawkweed)  area around pond.
<p/>Typical high elevation /
northern species on this Mtn are <i>Aralia nudicaulis, Maianthemum canadense,
Rubus hispidus, Trillium undulatum, Carex canescens
Vaccinium angustifolium
Pyrus americana, Sambucus pubens
Corylus cornuta, Viburnum cassinoides</i>
 
 <p/>
</ul><h3>May 14, 1994 Potts Cove
visit</h3>
<ul>





We also visited a cove known as "Potts Cove"
located about 1.5 mi
down the SE side of
Potts Mtn about a half mile in toward the
the SW from Forest Road 76. This cove is unlike any cove I've visited in
that its trees are dominantly oak, especially White Oak. There are only a few
Tuliptrees, although, perhaps
due to its
2700' elevation. However we saw no Basswood, White Ash etc. The soil appears
very acid and depleted. Mt Laurel is very abundant and Tea Berry has the
largest berries I ever saw. In general it is very ericaceous although well
watered. <i>Parnassia
assarifolia</i>[spel.]
is common in some places and I noticed some<i> Maianthemum canadense</i>. Some
Sweet Fern was also noted. A few White Pine were seen. The area has been
severely clearcut and since it has a gentle slope was probably farmed in the
past, grazed at least, although quite rocky in places. The soil seen appears to
be clay rich although we didn't have time to examine the soil well.
<p/>
Our return to the Steel Bridge Campground where Forest Road
descends bordering the SE edge of Shawers Run Wilderness I noted little or no
Tuliptree along the road from the Mountain top down to about the 2600 ft level
But just where the road leaves the Wilderness edge
and enters a small block of private land  (1966 Quad Map)  Tuliptree appears- in general conformity with experience=elsewhere.
The NW side of Potts Mt appears quite mesic

 <p/>
</ul><h3>5-23-94 Maple Flats  (Monday)</h3>
<ul>



 Steve Krichbaum and I went to Maple Flats to inventory flora and fauna
in our on-going project. As soon as we parked our truck I saw a Woodcock fly up
and land a short distance away under the bushes. Nuthatches, Tufted
Titmice
were also heard. Walking along
first artificial pond noted <i>Vitis labrusca</i>
Green frog and Bullfrog calling
In wetland adjacent to these ponds <i>Potentilla
simplex</i>(?), Vireo singing, <i>Hypoxis hirsuta </i> <i>Equisetum arvense,</i> Whorled
Loostrife[spel.], Mockernut Hickory with Gypsy Moth larvae on it. Also a small <i>Rubus</i>
with large white flowers and dull dark green leaves that creep but is not <i>R
hispidus</i>. Heard Yellow billed Cuckoo, Scarlet Tanager, Wood Thrush, Saw
Royal Fern
Indian Cucumber Root, Spice
Bush. At sinkhole #2  (so called by me)  across
the woods road from the artificial pond Saw Post Oak, Pin Oak, Black
Gum
Red Maple, Huckleberry sp? a <i>Salix
humilis</i> Persimmon
Wild Indigo(?),
Bracken Fern, Haircap and Sphadnum Moss, Pitch Pines with Deer berry on bank. At
what i call Sinkhole #3 on the other side of the west fork of the woods road I
saw a large Skink with a red head and very long tail  (perhaps 10-12 inches
long in all)  climb out of the water with a splash and [rapidly] climb a large
dead snag that stands in the water. Its probably a Broadheaded Skink.s In the
woods saw much low blueberry I identified  (tentatively)  as <i>Vaccinium
pallidum.</i> At sinkhole #4, a double hole nearby a flock of Cedar Waxwings
and rich chorus of several species of frogs we couldn't identify
Here also was <i>Lyonia ligustrina </i>in the
woods. Back on the other side of Sinkhole #3 saw a lone small (~15 ft) Hemlock
with no sign of Adelgids. Here also we saw Pine Beetles active in a living
Pitch Pine with resin oozing from their holes. We also heard the calls of Wood
Ducks.
 <p/>
</ul><h3>6-2,3-94 Laurel Run
Research Natural Area</h3>
<ul>
 
Trip to Laurel Run
Research Natural Area with R Hunsucker and Dotty[spel.]. I met them along Route
250 near Mc Dowell, Va. and we continued on through Brandywine, W Va. to Rough
Run Road and followed it through many fords, up the mountain. The Rough Run
Valley is quite mesic with much Hemlock at lower elevations and some Tuliptree
etc and much Sugar Maple and Basswood at higher elevations. The road to Hall
Spring  (FR 85)  passes through fairly typical oak forest at ~36oo' asl but
which contains some Chestnut Oak which have gone[?] a bit higher than its usual
3500' asl. White Oak is very abundant as is Northern Red Oak, Scarlet Oak and
there is sone Black Oak
Red Maple is the
only large maple on this mountain top although Striped Maple is common. An
unusual occurrence here is the abundant White Pine. Note* Scarlet and Black Oak
as well as Chestnut Oak are at 3600' asl
Witch Hazel is common and Mt Laurel, Black
Huckleberry
Deer berry <i>Vaccinium</i> <i>angustifolium</i>
and <i>V. pallidum</i> form a heavy undergrowth. Pitch Pine some of which show
banner shapes and Table Mtn Pines are scattered about as is a smaller quantity
of Hemlock  (no Adelgids here ?) 
American Chestnut sprouts are common. <i>Rhododendron roseum</i> is
scattered throughout and in full bloom
Along a hunter access road from the Hall Spring Area and leading down
the steep Northwest face of the Mtn, Along this road it's more mesic with moist
talus slope. Here we noted Black Locust, <i>Ilex montana,</i> White Basswood,
Hay scented Fern, <i>Dryopteris spinulosa, D intermedia, D marginalis,
Polypodium virginianum, Aster acuminatus,</i> Mountain Maple, Yellow Birch, <i>Ribes
rotundifolium</i>, Black Swallowtail Butterfly, Large Hemlock, Back on top on
the plateau we furthe noted <i>Dentaria, Oryzopsis racemosa</i>
Crested Flycatcher, Solitary Vireo,Tow[h]ee,
much Bear Oak
Black Oak, a single bush
of <i>Viburnum dentatum</i>  (complex) 
Spring Azure Butterfly, apparent possible Gypsy Moth defoliation but not
a sign of the Moth. 
<p/>
On the afternoon of the 2nd we hiked about 1.5 mi down the
Rader Mt Trail. The forest along this trail is much like that previously
described for the dry upland.<i> Aralia nudicaulis</i> is common. At some
springs near the road  (FR 85)  we chased up a woodcock and photographed its
tracks and probings. These little ponds also contained Newts. Also a tadpole
Along the trail Teaberry, Trailing Arbutus, <i>Leucobryum</i>
sp> Moss, White Snake Root, Fly Poison, <i>Hypoxis hirsuta</i>, Sweet Fern, <i>Aster
macrophyllus, Stenanthium gramineum</i>,Is this correct? <i>Lyonia ligustrina </i> Sassafras, <i>Trillium undulatum, Comandra
umbellata </i> (Bastard Toadflax),  <i>Actaea pachypoda</i> were noted. I heard
a Catbird and some chickadees as well as some warblers. Large toothed Aspen is
also fairly common along the trail. 
<p/>
In the evening at Camp heard a number of Veeries and during
the night Whippoor Wills and Barred Owls.
<p/>
The following is a list of species sent by Hunsucker that
must be added: for Rader Mt Trail <i>Amelanchier arborea, Carex pennsylvanica</i>
<i>Carex rosea, Carex debilis, Veratrum</i>
sp, Turkey Beard, <i>Uvularia pudica, Medeola virginica, Luzula campestris, Lacopus

Cypripedium acaule,</i> <i>Rubus hispidus Aronia melanocarpa</i>, Canada
Warbler,<i> Lycopus</i> <i>unifloras</i>[spel., repeat???]
Butterflies: Question Mark, Spring Azure, Unid
Dusty Wing Skipper.
<p/>
On 3 June we explored the vicinity of the Spruce Forest
along the Hall Spring run which falls near the boundary of private land. On the
way in Huns ucker spotted<i> Polytrichum juniperinum</i> and <i>P. communis,</i>
two Haircap Mosses. The forest in the vicinity of the Spruce consists of large
White Oak, Black Oak, Northern Red Oak
White Pine, Hemlock, Red Maple
Pitch Pine, Black Birch, Yellow Birch. There is a heavy undergrowth of
Mt Laurel and in some places <i>Rhododendron maximum.</i> The Red Spruce is in
some cases quite large with 1.5' dbh specimens. Witch Hazel and <i>Ilex montana</i>
are common. In more open areas <i>Vaccinium angustifolium</i> is abundant as is
<i>Trientalis borealis, Maianthemum canadense</i>, New York Fern and<i>
Houstonia cerulia</i>[spel.]. Sphagnum is abundant in moist areas and there are
also extensive patches of <i>Carex trisperma </i>and Carex leptalea. Other
species are <i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>
Indian Cucumber Roots <i>Viola sororia</i>
Gay Wings, L<i>uzula echinata, Galium
triflorum</i>, White Snake Root
<i>Anemone</i>
<i>quinquefolia, Glyceria striata, Oryzopsis racemosa
O. asperifolia, Lycopus uniflorus
Amelanchier arborea, Dryopteris marginalis,
Carex debilis
Smilax herbacea,
Rhododendron roseum, Trillium undulatum.</i> Turkey Beard is scattered throughout.
Other species in the moist areas are <i>Bazania</i>[spel.] <i>trilobata</i>. In
one place I saw a small patch of Partridge Berry, and in another, on the low
slope just above the springs Lycopodium annotinum. Hay scented Fern is also
present. <i>Lobaria</i> <i>pulmonaria</i>  (lichen on deciduous trees), <i>
Nowellia curvifolia </i>(leafy liverwort on down, dead conifer)  and<i>
Pseudevernia consocians </i> (lichen on Pitch Pine branches)  were also noted. Lycopodium
obscurum was also found. Birds seen or heard include Veery, Cedar Waxwing,
Canada Warbler, Chickadee
Turkey
Vulture. In some places Swamp Beacon mushrooms are scattered in the Sphagnum. A
large Bear track and Fox tracks were seen in the mud of springs.
<p/>
The main Spruce stands, which are in the spring and stream
area are surrounded by an envelope of small Spruce extending as understory
intothe surrounding upland oak forest. All the Spruce looks healthy and many
small spruce in the main forest show reproduction is strong. The main Spruce
forest has the aspect of old growth with much large woody debris. In places
mostly near some large Hemlocks, are large burned snags that probably burned
when they were already dry. The question here is : are the small spruce
invading the oak forest because of climate change or are they small because
fire has sweapt[spel.] the oaks in the past and been controlled recently? No <i>Aralia
nudicaulis</i>?-as along Rader Mt Trail oak forest
<p/>
A species we did not see, but that is here, according to
natural Heritage is Bunch Berry  (<i>Cornus canadensis</i>
We'll look for it in the future 
<p/>
This area is unusual
in that there are many White Pine some very large at essentially 3600' asl
<p/>
</ul><h3>6-8-94 St. Marys
Wilderness</h3>
<ul>
 
Hoagie an I visited the
lower St Marys Valley just E of the parking
lot
She to paint, I to botanize
Trees observed are Tuliptree, Cucumber
Magnolia, Sycamore
White Ash, Chestnut
Oak, orthern Red Oak, Black Oak
Black
Birch, Yellow Birch, Red Maple, Black Locust, Black Gum, Black Cherry,
Sassafras, Pignut, Virginia Pine, Pitch  (or Shortleaf)  Pine. Hemlock with an
understory of Flowering Dogwood. Virtually all the Hemlock are dying because of
the Adelgid and the oaks suffered severely from the Gypsy Moth several years
ago. However no sign of present Gypsy Moth or defoliation was seen and many of
the oaks look very healthy. There seems to be a heavy reproduction of Northern
Red Oak seedlings. Shrubs include, Mt Laurel  (in full bloom) 
Catawba Rhododendron  (in full bloom) 
Pinxter Azalea(?), <i>Menziesia pilosa,</i>
Hydrangea, Witch hazel, Spice Bush, Smooth Alder, <i>Viburnum dentatum</i>  (complex),  Mapleleaf Viburnum,<i> Ceononthus americanus </i> (New Jersey Tea), 
Virginia Creeper, Poison Ivy
Dutchmans
Pipe, Parridge Berry and varius species of Rubus  (Blackberry)  including
possibile <i>Rubus canadensis</i> are common. <i>Vitis labrusca</i> and<i>
Vitis aestivalis </i>are present. Herbs include <i>Gillenia trifoliata, Aralia
racemosa, Collinsonia canadensis</i>  (very abundant),  Zizia aurea, Z. aptera,
Geranium maculatum, Bleeding Heart, <i>Aster divaricatus </i> (very common),  <i>Aster
macrophyllus </i>(?), <i>Impatiens </i>sp, <i>Potentilla</i> sp
Uvularia perfoliata, Polygonum sp, Oxalis sp,
Hollow Joe Pye Plant[weed], Whorled Loostrife[spel.], Four leaved Yam, <i>Hieracium
venosum</i> Stonecrop sp. Panicum boscii, Hay scented Fern, Christmas Fern
Animals included Vireo, Yellow Billed Cuckoo,
Oreole[spel.], a cluster of very large Yellow Swallow Tailed Butterflies. The
undergrowth seemed particularly lush, perhaps due to the nutrients from the GM
defoliation of the past years. Many stinging flies were present so Hoagie had
to give up her painting 
<p/>
</ul><h3>6-18,19-94 Spruce Knob,
Allegheny Mtn, Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove</h3>
<ul>
 
Mike Jones and I went to a meeting of the WVa Environmental Council at
Woodlands Mtn Institute and botanized on Spruce Knob. We also stopped on
Allegheny Mtn on the State line to observe the vegetation. We also stopped at
the Fanny Bennett Grove
<p/>
We stopped at the highest point of RT250 on Allegheny Mtn
at 4336 ft asl. Northern Red Oak
Sugar
Maple, Yellow Birch, White Ash and Black Locust occur about in that order. On
Virginia West Virginia Line
Striped and
Mt Maple are ubderstory species. Aralia nudicaulis, White Snake Root
Culombine[spel.] and Dutchman's Pipe vine
were noted
<p/>
On our way we stopped along RT 259 near  (East)  of the
junction with
RT 28. In a small ponded
area along 250 we noted a considerable number of Wood Ducks.
<p/>
On our way we stopped at the Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove
noting again the species Hemlock, Sugar Maple
Black Birch, Northern Red Oak, Beech, Red Spruce
White Ash, Striped Maple,
Black Elderberry, <i>Viburnum alnifolium,
Viola rotundifolia </i>and Partridge Berry are the most common groundcover
Veronica officianalis[spel.]
Jewel plant[weed] sp?
Miterwort and Foamflower are all common as is
Sedum ternatum, Christmas Fern, <i>Dryopteris spinulosa
Bazania</i>[spel.] as well as many mosses.
The Red Spruce noted were all small but larger ones may be present. Scarlet
Tanagers were heard.
<p/>
</ul><h3>6-18,19-94 Woodlands Mtn
Institute </h3>
<ul>
 We hiked
in the woods at the
Institute grounds at about 4100 ft asl. Here the forest consists dominantly of
Sugar Maple, Red Maple, Yellow Birch, Beech, American Basswood, Black Cherry
Black Birch. Hophornbeam, Hawthorn, Striped
Maple occur as understory. There are substantial groves of fairly large Red
Spruce
<i>Maianthemum canadense,
Veratrum viride, Oxalis montana
Lycopodium flabelleform</i>[spel.]
and <i>L obscurum, Cladonia
Viola
</i>sp. Jack in the Pu;pit as well as the seed stalks of Ramps were noted. We
also saw just the two basal leaves of <i>Habenaria orbiculatus </i>and along a
small stream, <i>Saxifraga micranthidifolia. </i>HermitThrushes were heard.
<p/>
That evening we camped in a field undera large White Ash
and heard peepers call. Here i also noted a single Cucumber Magnolia at about
4100' asl.
<p/>
Hawthorn and<i> Vaccinium angustifolium</i> arevery common
in pastures and openings
The Hawthorn
has leaves like crataegus punctata. <i>Athyrium
filix-femina </i>was identified for the above forest later. Abeautiful
Moth was photographed
<p/>
</ul><h3>6-19-94 Spruce Knob </h3>
<ul>
 We
drove up to Spruce Knob. We explored along the SE face at about 4500' asl
Forest here consists of Red Oak (Northern),
Yellow Birch, Sugar Maple, Black Cherry, Beech, White Ash and
Red Spruce with Striped Maple, Hawthorn
understory. Along the road we noted Red Elderberry, Mountain Maple, Mountain
Ash and Skunk Current[spel.]. ALso <i>Rubus strigosus </i>Ground cover in the
woods is very rich in <i>Aster acuminatus</i>, Hay scented and other ferns.
Also <i>Botrychium virginianum</i>
Other
plants are Alternate leaved Dogwood
White Snakeroot, <i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>
Jack in the Pulpit, Carrion Flower, a <i>Thalictrum
</i>sp Hairy(?) Sweet Cicely, <i>Dicentra exima, Veratrum viride </i> <i>Oxalis montana, Dryopteris spinulosa,
Prenanthes</i> sp
Jewel Plant[weed],
Blue Cohosh, Black Cohosh(sp?) <i> Ranunculus recurvata</i>[spel] and <i>R
abortivus</i>. Along the road we noted large Cow Parsnip, Culumbine[spel.].
Here we also saw Zebra striped grsshoppers and we heard Scarlet Tanagers. <i>Carex
gynandra </i>was present in seeps in the woods. 
<br/>
We then drove to the top  (~4700' asl)  where we noted <i>Menziesia</i>
<i>pilosa, Maianthemum canadense,</i> Southern Mountain Cranberry, <i>Eupatorium
maculatum, Oxalis montana </i> (in full bloom compared to post bloom lower), <i>
Rhododendron roseum
Vaccinium
angustifolium, V pallidum</i>(?), <i>Cornus canadensis</i>, Shining Clubmoss,
Wild Raisin, red Maple, Service Berry sp, <i>Trillium</i> sp., <i>Clintonia </i>sp,

cilinode, </i> <i>Nemopanthus mucronatus </i>Mt
Ash Also <i>Trientalis borealis </i>showed up in photo!
with <i>Oxalis</i> 
<p/>
We heard Veerys[spel.] singing and saw what could only have
been Red Crossbills or purple Finch singing on the very top of Red Spruce
trees. There were two males, clearly in conflict and the red of their feathers
was clearly visible
I may also have seen
a large accipiter  (Goshawk?)  fly low over the trees, Thunderstorms were all
around but little or no rain fell.
<p/>
</ul><h3>6-23-94 Big Levels /
Kennedy Creek </h3>
<ul>
<br/> Elevation here is ~ 1800' asl Met Robert and Dotty[spel.] at
Kennedy Fields along Coal Road and we bushwacked along Kennedy Creek, a
beautiful stream in cobble fields and with many springy wetland side branches.
We penetrated perhaps a little over a mile to where the mountain sides close in
and narrow the bottomland. In the region of low relief for about a mile
upstream from the road there is a blending of upland forest and seepy wetland
areas that flank the stream, sometimes in flats and at other places in gullies.
The upland forest appears to consist dominantly of Scarlet Oak, Chestnut Oak,
Black Oak, Black Gum Sassafras and Pitch Pine. Chinquapin, Witch Hazel, Mt
Laurel and Deerberry are common. No Striped Maple ?
No Spice Bush ? Scattered high elevation
species present
In the wetland areas
Fringe Tree
Tuliptree, <i>Magnolia
acuminata</i>, Black Birch Red Maple and Black Gum. Shrubs in the wet areas are
Mt Laurel, <i>Rhododendron nudiflorum, R calendulaceum </i> Wild Raisin, <i>Menziesia pilosa, Vaccinium
corymbosum</i>  (very abundant),  <i>Gaylussacia frondosa</i>  (Dangleberry), <i>
Viburnum dentatum
Ilex verticillata,
Lyonia ligustrina</i>. Upstream a bit these shrubs are joined by <i>Rhododendron</i>
<i>catawbiense</i> and <i>Rubus hispidus; Aronia arbutifolia</i> also occurs
Teaberry is very abundant everywhere and Trailing Arbutus is common. There is a
little Spotted Wintergreen and <i>Goodyera pubescens</i> are dominated by
several species of beautiful Sphagnum Mosses, one of which was fruiting. New
York, Royal, Cinnamon and Interrupted Ferns are abundant. <i>Hexastylis
virginicus</i> At one place Sun Dew <i>Drosera </i>r<i>otundifolia</i> was
intergrown with sphagnum, A little Partridge Berry was noted in the upstream
areas and in two places single plants of <i>Aralia nudicaulis</i> and in one
place a single <i>Aster acuminatus</i>, both out of place elevationally. Indian
Cucumber root is very common in the wet sphagnum areas. Other plants are <i>Carex
debilis</i> var. <i>pubescens, C intumedscens Oxypolis rigidior, Parnassia
asarifolia, Smilax glauca, S, rotundifolia</i> and above all <i>Helonias
bullata</i>  (Swamp Pink)  in scattered but very common plants with no seed stalks
 (as far as we could see)  growing in fairly dense shade under shrubs. On the
stream bank I noted <i>Alnus serulata</i>[spel.] and Flowering Dogwood. Where
the mountains close in we saw Sweet Fern also. Some upland plants noted were <i>Stipa
avenacea </i> (Needle grass), <i> Helianthus divaricatus
Solidago odora
Ipomoea pandurata, Melampyrum lineare</i>  (This is particularly abundant in a wide-leaved form and patronized by small
Bumblebees),  Bracken Fern, Whorled Loostrife[spel]
<i>Viola primulifolia, v. pedata, Panicum</i>
<i>lanuginosum, Hypoxis hirsuta</i>, Pink Ladyslipper  (common),  <i>Hexastylis
virginica</i> (?)  (in bloom),  <i>Deschampsia flexuosa </i> ("Hair
grass" with involute leaves),  <i>Euphorbia corollata</i>, <i>Aster
linariifolius</i>, <i>A. divaricatus</i>, <i>Hypericum hypericoides</i>, <i>Lechia</i> sp,<i>
Polygala polygama (</i> cleistogamus flowers),  <i>Linum virginianum,
Helianthemum canadense</i>  (Frostweed),  *<i>Carex polymorpha </i> (Federal C<sub>2
</sub>species) 
Along Trail, <i>Aletris
farinosa </i> (Colicroot)   (in wood road),  Tephrosia virginiana  (large clump
in forest opening  (Can be used to kill fish!) 
<i>Angelica venenosa, Seriocarpus asteroides, Uvularia pudica </i> Wild Indigo.
<br/>Mushrooms noted were<i>
Pluteus cervinus, Suillus pictus, Tylopilus</i>  (syn. <i>Austroboletus) 
graclis, Polyporus elegans
Amanita
citrinum, A
muscaria </i>var<i>.
formosa, A. virosa, A. ceciliae
Ricknella</i>[spel.] <i>fibula, Marasmius </i>spp<i>, Russula </i>spp<i>.
Omphalotus olearius.</i>
<p/>
There were a few Gypsy Moth larvae  (large)  and pupae.
There is little damage to oaks near the road where the land is relatively flat
but where the mountains close in around the stream there are many-almost all-
dead large oaks. There is also sign that the Chestnut blight affects Chinquapin
and some sign of past fires in the form of a burnt snag was seen 
<p/>
Pickerel Frogs were common in the stream near the
mountains. We heard Scarlet Tanagers and near the mountains Wood Thrush.
Climate seems more moist than in Shenandoah Valley and we were caught in some
showers as we exited through Kennedy Fields. Evidence of the Pine Beetle was
also seen.
<p/>
The substrate here appears to be cobble to boulder fan
deposits and in the stream white sand contributing to the generally acid
conditions.
  
 <p/>

</ul><h3>6-29,30-94 Skidmore Fork  </h3>
<ul>


Visit by Gus and Io Skidmore Fork 20 miles West of Harrisonburg Va 
in the GWNF
We looked over the Valley here for a possible
rendezvous site and hiked to the Old Growth Forest at the headwaters, On June
29 we concentrated on the Valley bottom  (flood plain)  between the upper end
of the reservoir and the private land a mile upstream. This area was the site
in recent years of severe Gypsy Moth defoliation and subsequent salvage
logging. We saw no sign of Gypsy Moths at present. In the lower end of the
Valley the following trees are common: Hemlock
Tuliptree, Cucumber Magnolia, Shagbark Hickory, Pignut Hickory, Black
Locust, White Pine, Pitch Pine, Red Maple White Ash Sycamore, Black Birch.
Upstrean Sugar Maple is more abundant and there is surviving large White Oak.
There are young Black Oaks and Hophornbeam occurs. Northern Red Oak was
severely hit but there are seedlings of this species. Black raspberry in fruit
are lush and Blackberry (sp?) is common. Partridge Berry and <i>Maianthemum
canadense</i> occur separately or are intergrown under Hemlock. Christmas and
Hay Scented
Ferns are common, as is Mtn.
Laurel. <i>Aster divaricatus </i>is widespread. In one place many large
Fritillary Butter Flies were on Common Milkweed. They were either Great
Spangled or Aprodites. A beautiful Luna Moth also took off in spectacular
flight. In one place were the largest Jack in the Pulpit I've ever seen. Other
species noted were Culombine[spel.], Miterwort
Sriped Maple, White Snakeroot, Dryopteris spinulosa, FloweringDogwood
Potentila sp  (a creeping species is very
common everywhere and there is a little
Virginia Creeper There is als o a little Spicebush. One large White
Basswood
was noted. Veronica officinalis
is widespread also. Wood Thrushes, Scarlet Tanagers, Virios[spel.] were heard
and a Catbird was observed. The Hemlock in the open appears quite healthy and
vigorous although infected with the Adelgid.
<p/>
On the 30th, after a night of heavy thundershowers and
biting insects, we hiked upstream. Gus first noted peculiar tiny yellow biting
insect
The forest is dominated by
Hemlock-degraded by the Adelgid-of 1 ft to 2 ft, diameter, mostly on the small
side and clearly second growth. Within this Hemlock matrix there are large
White Pine, Red Maple  (some very large)  Black Gum, Northern Red Oak, White
Oak, Chestnut Oak Pignut, Shagbark, White Ash
Black Birch
Sugar Maple and
Tuliptree, the latter scattered thinly to 2800 ft asl. Some Pitch Pine also
occurs. A Service Berry with ripe red berries along the trail
Witch hazel, Striped Maple, Mt Laurel form
the undergrowth. Along the stream there is lush herbaceous growth that includes
<i>Laportea canadensis</i> and White Snake Root. There is also some
Cucumber Magnolias. In one place we saw Virginia Waterleaf. At about 2800 ft
asl Yellow Birch appears. Finally we reached the old growth stands along
Skidmore Fork on steep mountain side. At fork take right (N) fork going
upstream At this point the old growth consisted of Hemlock  (with Adelgid), 
Beech, Sugar Maple, Northern Red Oak Yellow Birch, Black Birch. Herbaceous
vegetation is lush along the stream. Ferns are abundant under the large trees. <i>Viola
rotundifolia</i>, <i>Dryopteris spinulosa</i>, White Snakeroot, <i>Laportea
canadensis </i> Jewelplant[weed]
Miterwort and in the stream, Golden Saxifrage  (<i>Chrisosplenium americanum</i>), were noted. Birds heard on this hike include Scarlet Tanager, Wood Thrush
and Virio[spel.].We also flushed some Ruffed Grouse. We didn't have time to
penetrate this old growth grove except on its edge.
<p/>
Upstream from where we camped, along the FS Road which
follows along the W side of the Valley between the Mountains and private
inholding and a fairly high course  (up to 100 ft)  above the floodplain
I noted in addition to the dominant Hemlock,
many large White Oak, Chestnut Oak, Scarlet Oak, Northern Red Oak, White Pine,
Black Gum. On the road bank their lush growth of Mt Laurel, Mt Fetterbush  (<i>Pieris
floribunda</i>)  Sassafras, <i>Desmodium</i>
sp, <i>Goodyera pubescens</i>, Rattlesnake Hawkplant[weed]  (<i>Hieracium
venosum</i>),,  <i>Sedum</i> sp, <i>Vicia</i> sp.  (glaberous)  <i> Hypoxis hirsuta </i>, Sensitive, Hay Scented,
Christmas Ferns. No <i>Gaultheria procumbens
Lyonia ligustrina,</i> Whorled
Loostrife[spel.], <i>Hepatica americana Houstonia longifolia.</i> In moist
shaded areas farther onthere was Clearplant[weed], that night we were inspired
by the number of Whippoorwills and three or so Barred Owls.
<p/> 

</ul><h3>Johns Run of Big
Levels 7-3-94  </h3>
<ul>


 (Partially in Hampton Formation)  Steve Krichbaum and I hiked up Johns
Run of Big Levels
in the GWNF.The first
part of the hike from the road is through dry, acidic forest -except right
on
the stream
There are many fewer seeps and wetlands than
along Kennedy
Creek however. Progressing
upstream the forest becomes more mesic and perhaps less acid
although Partridge Berry is abundant
everywhere. The dry forest consists of Chestnut
Scarlet, Black and some Northern Red Oak, Black Gum, Sassafras, red
Maple, Pitch Pine. Undergrowth is largely Mt Laurel, Black Huckleberry, Deer
Berry and the low Blueberries  (perhaps <i>V pallidum </i>). The low
Blueberries were beginning to fruit. Near the Stream Tuliptree <i>Menziesia
Lyonia ligustrina,</i> Fringe Tree, Smooth
Alder, Wild Raisin, <i>Vaccinium corymbosum</i> and Flowering Dogwood are
common. In the dry forest <i>Coreopsis major</i> and <i>C. verticillata </i>occurs,
the former in full bloom. <i>Tephrosia virginiana,</i> Trailing Arbutus,
Teaberry, <i>Iris</i> sp. Rattlesnake Hawkplant[weed] <i> Potentilla</i> sp
Wild Indigo, Maple leaf Viburnum <i> Houstonia longifolia</i>, <i>Aster linariifolius
Hypoxis hirsuta</i>, Bracken Fern
Partridge Berry, <i>Aster divaricatus</i>
occur in dry and fringing wet areas. Upstream at about 2000 ft asl small
patches of Sphagnum and scattered<i> Aralia nudicaulis</i> and<i> Aster
acuminatus</i> appear until at ~2500 ft asl
they become the dominant herbaceous vegetation. Helonias bullata is
scattered sparsely in wet areas along the stream beginning at low elevations.
Upstream above 2000' asl Northern Red Oak increase greatly and Hemlock appears
in small trees that have lost most of their foliage. There are some very large
Tuliptrees. Also Yellow Birch appears and Black Birch becomes more common.
Black Locust, American Chestnut, Witch Hazel, Sevvice Berry occurs, Also <i>Rhododendron
catawbiense</i> appears above
2000' asl
but is not prominent.
Cinnamon Fern and
Sphagnum become more common up along the stream. <i>Smilax rotundifolia</i> is
very vigorous in moist areas. Indian Cucumber root increases upward and there
is some Spice bush. New York Fern is dominant ground cover in many places both
at lower and higher elevations and some Christmas Fern occurs in richer areas. <i>Veronica
officinalis</i> occurs but is not as widespread as Partridge Berry.<i>
Chantrelle</i>[spel.] Mushrooms were noted in the trail as was Pink Ladyslipper
leaves. Four leaved Wild Yam is present as is <i>Melampyrum lineare</i> and <i>Viola
</i>sp. A few White Ash seedlings were noted but not a trace of Beech or Sugar
Maple. In the more mesic upstrean areas May Apple., Virginia Creeper, False
Solomon Seal, Dutchmans pipe appear. One Butternut  (large)  was noted. At
about 2400' asl Striped Maple [the] first! appeared and<i> Viola rotundifolia </i>is
common in Hemlock areas and along the stream. There is a little Spotted
Wintergreen. Scarlet Tanagers and Wood Thrush as well as other bird, including
Pileated Woodpeckers were heard and seen. There are also unidentified members
of the Lily Family such as perhaps <i>Uvularia</i> and Solomons Seal, neither in
bloom. At the stream headwaters we approached at ~2600 ft asl
<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i> and especially <i>Aster
acuminatus</i> become more common as does Striped Maple. In the Old Crowth at
this elevation Hemlock, now almost defoliated, dominates with Northern Red Oak,
Black and Yellow Birch, Tuliptree may go as above 2600 ft here. <i>Ilex
montana,</i> <i>Rhododendron</i> <i>catawbiense</i>, Striped Maple, Witch Hazel
form the undergrowth. Ground cover is Partridge Berry, A<i>ster acuminatus,</i>
Indian Cucumberroot, <i>Dryopteris spinulosa, Viola rotundifolia </i> On the way down Wood Betony was seen in the
trail and farther down some
Bear Oak.
Also in one area of the dry forest we noted the distinctive leaf form of
Blackjack Oak, <i>Quercus marilandica,</i> which would be in keeping with the
sandy soil.
<p/> 
</ul><h3>7-17-94 Peters Mill Run</h3>
<ul>

~1400-1500'
asl
Steve Krichbaum, Mike Jones and I
went to Peters Mill Run east of Woodstock, Va. We hiked up the Powell Mtn trail
which is now
an "official" ATV
Trail and is being greatly abused. Its a scandal that these vehicles are
permitted in close proximity to the stream-indeed anywhere. However we hiked
upstream along this trail after first noting the rich, highly mesic character
of the forest with White Basswood and Beech-on the top and west slope of Powell
Mtn. 
<p/>
The forest along Peters Mill Run is-or at least was- before
the Gypsy Moth-dominated by White Oak but with abundant Tuliptree and Red
Maple. Black Gum Pitch Virginia and White Pine are also common, the latter in
part planted
There is some Pignut and
Mockernut Hickory and in richer areas Slippery Elm and White Ash
Scarlet and Northern Red Oak are also common
as is Black Locust and Black Cherry occurs. <i>Viburnum dentatum</i> and Maple
leaf Viburnum,,Witchhazel and Mountain Laurel are common in the understory and
Black Haw Viburnum occurs. Flowering Dogwood is also common. I saw one small  (healthy)  Hemlock. In the wooded wetland seeps that we saw Red Maple<br/> Black
Birch<br/>
Black Gum<br/>, Tuliptree
dominate.
The understory shrubs are Mtn
Laurel, <i>Lyonia ligustrina, Aralia </i>sp ?
<i>Viburnum dentatum, Ilex verticillata, Aronia </i>sp(?) Spice Bush,
Smooth Alder, Cinnamon and Royal Ferns are common. In one place, in an open
wetland, there were Cattails and Southern Water Plantain. Unidentified sedges
abounded. The wetland seemed to be of varying degrees of acidity with patches
of <i>Sphagnum </i>and <i>Rubus hispidus.</i> In one place in an acid seep open
to the sky, we saw what appeared to be poorly developed Cotton Grass[really a
sedge]
 (<i>Eriophorum</i> <i>virginicum</i>). Many areas are dominated by New York Fern and Rubus hispidus is very
widespread as is creeping
potentilla
(sp?) Very little Tea Berry-and that in bloom-was noted althoughTrailing
Arbutus is common in dry areas. In places Sensitive Fern is common and
Christmas Fern is scattered. In places less acid <i>Asplenium</i> Ferns are
common. I thought I saw <i>Botrichium virginianum </i>also. <i>Lycopodium </i> including<i> L obsurum, L. flabelliforme</i>(?)
and<i> L lucidulum </i>are common in both wet and dry acid areas. 
<p/>
In the upland areas Chestnut Oak is-or was -common and in
places there are scattered small groves of Large toothed Aspen in the oak-pine
forest. Chinquapin is very common and American Chestnut occurs. Beaked Hazelnut
 (a few)  was observed, as was Menziesia pilosa,
Bear Oak and Sassafras is common
Along the road in the upland, Wild Indigo, M<i>elampyrum
lineare</i>, Rattlesnake Hawkweed, Bracken Fern, <i>Hypoxis hirsuta </i> St. Andrews Cross (<i> Hypericum hypericoides </i>),
<i>Potentilla</i> sp(?) Trailing Arbutus, <i>Coreopsis verticillata </i> Haircap Moss, Black Huckleberry, Mt Laurel,
Blueberry  (low sp?),  Whireled Loostrife[spel.], <i>Lycopodium </i>are all
common. A large umbelliferous plant, possibly<i> Ligusticum canadense </i> (Lovage) (?) is fairly common. <i>Gallium</i>[spel] species are very common
especially in moist areas. In one place a <i>Lechea</i> sp?  (Pinplant[weed]) 
was noted and in another, <i>Specularia perfoliata. Veronica officianalis</i>[spel.]
is also common. We saw Partridge Berry in only one place, on a stream bank.
Various specimens of small and large <i>Rubus </i> (Dew and Blackberries)  are
common in moister open areas. Some <i>Rubus hispidus</i> was still in bloom.
<p/>
We heard Wood Thrush, scarlet Tanager, Vireo and Ravens. On
our way out we heard two Barred Owls at about $:00 PM.
Frogs, especially Green Frogs, seemed abundant
wherever there was water and in an artificial pond we saw them as well as
pickerel frogs and a water snake. We saw no salamanders, though we didn't
search diligently for them. We saw small  (1 inch long)  fish in the stream.
<p/>
The only evidence of the Gypsy Moth were the great number
of dead oaks, esp. White and Northern Red as we ascended the Valley. Apparently
spraying had protected the trees near the Campground. However there were also a
fair amount of large surviving Northern Red, White and Chestnut Oaks far from
there in virgin tract areas, although these usually had large dead limbs.
<p/>
We didn't see the Black Ash that is supposed to be here.
Neither did we see Highbush Blueberry that occurs in similar wetlands
elsewhere. The only markedly out of place high elevation / northern species
observed is Beaked Hazelnut. There weren't any dead certain identifications of
Indian Cucumberroot either-which also is usually present, as at Maple Flats and
high elevations wetlands we visited.
<p/>
Mike took a lot of exposures with his video camera
particularly of ATV abuse
I took none.
