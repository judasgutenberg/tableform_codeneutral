<h1>Three Forks of the Williams River</h1>
<strong>Source Walks; 9-2-97, 9-3-97 and 9-4-97</strong>

<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<P>
  The Three Forks area is one of alluvial and colluvial convergence. Here both water 
and air find their way to lower elevations from adjacent mountain heights and interact 
with bedrock and soils to form contrasting forest types and plant communties. Elevations range from less than 2400 feet (732 meters) along the Williams mainstem to more 
than 4500 feet (1372 meters)asl on the plateau. Rocks in the area have close to 
horizontal attitudes and are dominated by sandstones, siltstones and shales with 
minor carbonate beds and coal. Lowest lying, and bordering the bottomland alluvium, is the 
Mississippian Bluestone Formation, which includes red shales. Above this formation 
lies the New River Formation, forming low and middle slopes, and higher still, the 
Kanawha Formation of upper mountain spurs and summits. Both of the last two named formations 
are Pennsylvanian in age (Cardwell<i> et al </i>
, 1968).<p>
The Williams mainstem, as well as the lower Middle and Little Forks, have extensive 
valley flats (floodplains). In the vicinity of the stream channels and former channels 
the bedload of these mountain streams consists of boulders and cobbles, while in 
many places away from the channels there are sand and pebble deposits that result in 
generally acidic and infertile topsoils. Only in isolated enclaves are there richer 
alluvial soils on the valley flats. Also, proximity to large upstream highlands encourages the draining of cold air and its accumulation on the flats. As a consequence, although 
some species, such as certain trees, do well, there is a relatively low plant diversity 
there. The flora of the valley flats and smaller floodplains at Three Forks contrasts in a somewhat predictable way with that at the Tea Creek campground on the 
upper Williams mainstem. Because the Tea Creek campground is also subject to cold 
air drainage/accumulation from the heights, and because it lies 600 feet (184 meters ) higher than Three Forks, it contains more markedly cool climate species and communities, 
including in particular Red Spruce, Canada Yew (<i>Taxus canadensis </i>), more Yellow Birch and only very little Tuliptree. However, despite the cooler conditions, 
there appears to be more shrub, herb and possibly even more tree diversity at Tea 
Creek. This could be a consequence of the occurrence there of the Hinton Formation, which may be richer in carbonate than the Three Forks rocks and, in particular, 
the siliceous sediments of the valley flats.<p>
Although they share many of the canopy species of the valley flats, the colluvial 
slopes inventoried by us have some additional trees and shrubs and a far more diverse 
community of herbs.  It is likely that this 
community is a good example of bedrock geology and chemistry acting in concert with 
colluvial processes and with climatic factors such as air drainage and aspect.<p>
Both the valley flat and upland forests of the area have the characteristics generally 
associated with the Allegheny cloudy- day maximum and high precipitation. Thus, although 
Northern Red Oak is prominent in the canopy, it is virtually the only oak. Additionally, pines are absent and there are few or no species of hickory, walnut, elm, 
or a numberof other genra common in the Valley and Ridge.<p>
The Three Forks of the Williams fall partly within the federally-designated Cranberry 
Wlderness and partly in areas of the Monongahela National Forest that are not protected 
from road building and clearcut logging. The entire area is recovering from a period of destructive logging and fires and has the potential for the establishment of 
an ecosystem not seen since this occurred. An example is the recent sightings of 
nesting pairs of the Northern Goshawk (<i> Accipiter gentilis </i>) in this watershed, both within and outside the Cranberry Wilderness. The reestablishment 
of a fully functional ecosystem that includes sensitive species like the Goshawk 
is ultimately grounded in the integrity and diversity of the forest plant communities such as are found particularily in mature and old growth forest.<p>
Our inventories here consisted of three parts. The first probed the vicinity of the 
campground, which lies at the base of a mountain spur on the east side of the valley 
flat. The second consisted of a traverse up the Little Fork and the third of a traverse along the County Line Trail up the side of the spur into the Cranberry Wilderness.<p>
</ul>
<h2>Camp Area</h2>
<ul>

The floodplain canopy in the vicinity of the campground is dominated by large Northern 
Red Oak, with abundant mature but generally smaller Beech, Red and Sugar Maples, 
Yellow Birch, Yellow Buckeye, Black Locust, Black Cherry (of excellent form), White 
Ash and less frequent Tuliptree, Shagbark Hickory and Canada Hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis </i>). No Red Spruce was seen and the only shrubs noted were abundant Great Rhododendron 
(<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>), Witch Hazel (<i> Hamamelis virginiana </i>), a little Black Elderberry (<i> Sambucus canadensis </i>) and a trace of Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea arborescens</i>). The floodplain soil here is very sandy and there was only a sparse ground flora 
consisting mostly of unidentified violets (<i> Viola</i>
 sp), Partridge Berry (<i> Mitchella repens </i>), Indian Cucumber-root (<i> Medeola virginiana </i>), Cinnamon Fern (<i> Osmunda cinnamomea </i>) and Saw Brier (<i>Smilax glauca</i>), with the last two heavily browsed by Deer. The Scaly Vase Chanterelle (<i> Gomphus floccosus</i>) was also found.<p>
A greater diversity of herbs occurred along a small springbrook adjacent to the camp 
and along the gravel road in the camp clearing. Identified along this stream were 
Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>), deciduous Spinulose Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris carthusiana</i>), Southern Lady Fern (<i> Athyrium filix-femina</i>) New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis </i>), Crooked-stem aster (<i>Aster</i>
 <i>prenanthoides </i>) in bloom, White Wood Aster (<i>A. divaricatus </i>),Big-leaf Aster (<i>A. macrophyllus</i>), Golden Ragwort (<i> Senecio aureus</i>), Pallid and Spotted Jewelweeds (<i>Impatiens pallida</i>
 and<i> I. capensis </i>), Virginia Knotweed (<i> Polyganum virginianum </i>), Water Smartweed (<i>P.</i>
 <i>punctatum </i>), Asiatic Water Pepper (<i> P. cespitosum </i>), Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>), Broad-leaf Waterleaf (<i> Hydrophyllum canadense</i>), Foam Flower (<i> Tiarella cordifolia </i>), Mad-dog Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria lateriflora </i>), Hispid Buttercup (<i> Ranunculus hispidus</i>), Fringed Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia ciliata </i>), Common Speedwell (<i>Veronica officinalis</i>) and Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola blanda</i>). Species growing in the open included Ox Eye (<i> Heliopsis helianthoides </i>), Giant Sunflower (<i>Helianthus giganteus </i>), Thin-leaved Sunflower (<i>H</i>
. <i>decapetalus</i>), Wrinkled-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa </i>) and Panicled Aster (<i>Aster simplex </i>), all of which were in bloom.Because of the proximity of the limestone gravel road, 
the chance exists that some species listed owe their presence to nutrients derived 
from this source. This possibility is supported by the absence of a number of those 
species in more isolated parts of the valley flat.<p>
Bordering the floodplain on the east is a steep colluvial slope at the base of the 
mountain spur. The soil here is red in color, contains red shale fragments and because 
of its location, is probably derived from the Bluestone Formation. The fertility 
of this soil is indicated by a luxuriant herb flora under Sugar Maple, Yellow Buckeye 
and Dotted Thorn (<i>Crataegus punctata </i>). The most conspicuous of these herbs was graceful and imposing Twin Grass 
(<i>Diarrhena americana</i>), a western species which occurs as large clumps or patches on the steep slope. Associated herbs were 
Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata </i>), the sedge <i>Carex plantaginea</i>
, White Snake Root (<i> Eupatorium rugosum</i>) in bloom, Wild Stonecrop (<i> Sedum ternatum </i>), Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i> Galium triflorum </i>), Broad-leaved Waterleaf, Virginia Knotweed, Christmas Fern, Wood Nettle, Honewort 
(<i>Cryptotaenia canadensis </i>), Calico Aster (<i>Aster lateriflorus </i>), Lowrie's aster (<i>A.</i>
 <i>lowrieanus </i>), Big-leaf Aster, White Wood Aster, Broad-leaf Goldenrod (<i> Solidago flexicaulis </i>), Large-flowered Bellwort (<i> Uvularia</i>
 <i>grandiflora </i>), Bottlebrush Grass (<i> Hystrix patula</i>), the forest bluegrass <i>Poa alsodes</i>
, the managrass <i>Glyceria melicaria</i>
, Smooth Sweet Cicely (<i> Osmorhiza longistylis</i>), Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa </i>), Wild Geranium (<i> Geranium maculatum </i>), Great Chick Weed (<i> Stellaria pubera</i>), Palmate-leaf Violet (<i>Viola palmata</i>) and a Disporum (probably <i>D. lanuginosum</i>). Also present was Hispid Greenbrier (<i>Smilax hispida </i>), as distinguished from <i>H. glauca  </i>
on the floodplain's acid soil. A little Creeping Five-leaf (<i> Potentilla simplex </i>) occured at the base of the slope where, presumably, the transition to these soils 
occurs.<p>
A number of these herbs, in particular <i>Carex plantaginea</i>
, Broad-leaf Goldenrod and Large-flowered Bellwort, are usually identified with the 
richest forest soils.<p>
</ul>
<h2>Little Fork Trail</h2>
<ul>

On the morning of 9-3-97, with rain clouds threatening, we traversed of the order 
of 4/5 mile (1.3 km) up the Little Fork Trail. Initially it was so dark under the 
canopy that it was difficult to identify some plants. In what follows biological 
elements and terrain features will be listed in the sequence in which they were observed.<p>
Our traverse began at the open trailhead beside a small seep. Plants identified here 
were Tall Coneflower (<i>Rudbeckia laciniata</i>), Oswego Tea (<i>Monarda didyma</i>), Great Blue Lobelia (<i>Lobelia</i>
 <i>siphilitica</i>), Clearweed (<i>Pilea pumila </i>), White Grass (<i> Leersia</i>
 <i>virginica</i>), Hispid Buttercup, Bottlebrush Grass, Wrinkled-leaf Goldenrod, Deer-tongue Grass 
(<i>Panicum clandestinum </i>) and the hawthorns Dotted Thorn and Large-seeded Thorn (<i>Crataegus macrosperma</i>).<p>
On entering the forest we noted generally young Hemlock, Black Cherry, Northern Red 
Oak and Yellow Birch, followed by small Yellow Buckeye in a clearing. Not far beyond 
the clearing we came upon a small stream bordered by Hemlock, Red Maple, Sycamore 
and Yellow Birch and then, at the trail side, noted Allegheny Fly-back (<i>Danthonia compressa </i>), the fungus <i>Lactarius hygrophoroides</i>
  and the mosses Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>) and a species of <i>Mnium</i>
. We had now reached a much larger stream, Middle Fork, which joins Little Fork nearby. 
This stream was also bordered by Hemlock, Northern Red Oak, Sycamore and some Tuliptree 
as well. Muscletree was conspicuous in the understory, as was  Great Rhododendron in the shrub layer. A feature here was the foliage of Tuliptree, which was much 
eaten away, presumably by an insect. Another striking feature of this picturesque 
stream crossing were boulders of a colorful breccia, composed of angular fragments 
of a sandstone embedded in and cemented by another sandstone, both having been transformed 
to quartzite. Some of these boulders, which were part of the stream's bedload, were 
almost three feet (one meter) in diameter.<p>
Having crossed Middle Fork, we continued up the steeper, but still gentle slope of 
the Little Fork valley. Here Partridge Berry and <i>Diranum</i>
  moss indicated more acid conditions under large Northern Red Oak and many small 
Hemlock. These were shortly followed along the trail by the fungus <i>Entoloma salmoneum</i>
, a creature of &quot;moist or mossy soil, humus, or leaf litter under conifers or hardwoods&quot; 
(Phillips, 1991), and continuing the acid trend, Painted Trillium (<i>Trillium undulatum</i>), Great Rhododendron, Medeola and Red Maple. Here also was the chanterelle<i> Cantharellus cibarius ,</i>
and a little farther on,<i> Boletus bicolor</i>
. Then in succession, we heard the calls of Ravens (<i>Corvus corax </i>), saw our first Black Birch, then the fungus <i>Amanita falax</i>
,<i> Hypnum</i>
  moss, abundant Beech, Beech Drops (<i>Epifagus virginiana</i>), Hemlock and Yellow Birch, with scattered Tuliptree. Then, standing out clearly 
against the trunk of a diseased Red Maple, was a cluster of Oyster Mushroom (<i><EM> Pleurotus ostreatus </EM></i>) and not far beyond, our first Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense </i>). These were followed by the fungi <i>Crepidotus applanatum</i>
  and <i>Leccinum insigne</i>
, Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia </i>) and patches of Shining Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium lucidulum </i>). At this point Tuliptree appeared to increase in abundance, accompanied by the fungus 
<i>Lycoperdon pyriforme</i>
  and a  Rattlesnake Plantain, likely <i>Goodyera pubescens.</i>
<p>
On approaching the first crossing of meandering Little Fork we noted the fungus<i> Amanita flavoconia</i>
  and a little White Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis montana</i>), then, beyond the crossing, the poisonous puffball <i>Scleroderma citrinum</i>
, the edible fungus<i> Xerula furfuracea</i>
, and on the stream bank, a species of the liverwort <i>Scapania</i>
, growing with a <i>Mnium</i>
 moss. Continuing along the trail, there was Round-leaf Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia</i>), Downy Rattlesnake Plantain,Striped Maple, very large Red Maple, abundant White 
Wood Sorrel, more Intermediate Shield Fern, a <i>Hypnum</i>
 moss, Beech, Yellow Birch and Black Cherry of excellent form. Some of the Yellow 
Birch here bore erruptions of the northern conk <i>Inonotus obliqus</i>
, that also has medicinal qualities. It was shortly followed by New York Fern, a Cucumbertree 
(<i>Magnolia</i>
 <i>acuminata</i>), a single small Sugar Maple and the White Cheese mushroom<i> Tyromyces chioneus</i>
, which, despite its name, is not edible.<p>
We had now arrived at a wilderness boundary marker, just off the trail, where the 
boundary left the stream at a right angle, indicating we had come perhaps 2/3 mile 
(1.1 km). Here, where the valley had become more constricted, a sharp eye among 
us caught sight of a substantial patch of Black Chanterelles (<i>Cantherellus fallax </i>) and well worth our collecting. These were followed by a light yellow Eastern Newt 
(<i>Notophthalmus viridescens </i>) in the trail, the fungus<i> Amanita daucipes</i>
, Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>) and another stream crossing. On the far bank abundant White Wood Sorrel was accompanied 
by <i>Amanita ceciliae</i>
, and just beyond, Sugar Maple saplings averaging no more than an inch (2cm) in 
diameter abruptly appeared. As we continued onward White Wood Sorrel remained very 
abundant in terrain littered by sandstone blocks heavily moss-covered by species 
of<i> Hypnum, Dicranum</i>
 and <i>Thuidium</i>
  accompanied by <i>Cladina</i>
  lichens. In a somewhat unusual association, a much-browsed Hispid Greenbrier was 
found in acid environment at the base of a Red Maple. Also of widespread occurrence 
here was a blackberry, possibly <i>Rubus canadensis</i>
, but consisting only of short heavily-browsed canes. Not far beyond, a small seep 
had White Grass and Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus </i>), while a  grape fern, likely<i> Botrychium dissectum</i>
, grew on an adjacent bank.<p>
For some distance we had been following an old, and at this point, elevated railroad 
grade, which may have encouraged certain unexpected species. These included a single 
plant of Ramp (<i> Allium tricoccum </i>), which is usually associated with better soils, abundant Christmas Fern, Foam Flower 
and many Sugar Maple seedlings, as well as a few seedlings of Yellow Buckeye, a species 
not seen above the lower part of the traverse. Here also the valley is quite constricted, and the mountain slope rises steeply above the stream. A spot inventory yielded 
abundant small to mature Yellow Birch, some Hemlock and Tuliptree, small Sugar Maple, 
Striped Maple, Witch Hazel and common Intrmediate Shield Fern, all at an elevation near 2500 feet (760 meters)asl, where our traverse was terminated.<p>
Several interesting species not observed on our ascent of the valley were noted on 
our return. These were a young Fraser Magnolia (<i> Magnolia fraseri </i>) and a sapling Umbrella Magnolia (<i>M.</i>
 <i>tripetala </i>), curiously growing in close proximity to each other. Were they the products of a 
single bird excretion transported from the south? We will never know! Here also, 
as reported earlier for Tuliptree, the leaves of these magnolias had been heavily 
fed upon by some insect.<p>

<h2>County Line Trail</h2>
<ul>
<p>
Our traverse up the County Line Trail brought us the surprise of an extensive rich 
mesic forest quite different from the northern hardwood type usually associated with 
the Allegheny highlands. Our traverse along this trail on the cool morning of 9-4-97 
extended for perhaps 2/3 mile (1.1 km) from the valley flat to an elevation of somewhat 
over 3000 Feet (915 meters), gradually ascending the southwest and south-facing 
slopes. Bedrock along the traverse was initially Bluestone Formation, then, for most 
of the way, New River, and probably Kanawha at the highest elevations attained. All 
but the initial section lay in the Cranberry Wilderness.<p>
Initially the trail is steep and ascends the colluvial slope over the same red-colored 
rock and soil and with a herb flora similar to that described earlier. The canopy 
here consisted of large Northern Red Oak and smaller Yellow Birch, Yellow Buckeye, 
American Basswood, Beech, Shagbark Hickory White Ash and Black Locust. Dotted Thorn and 
Hophornbeam formed an understory. The only shrub noted here was Witch Hazel, but 
both Hispid and Common Greenbrier were present. Here also the most conspicuous and 
striking herb was Twin Grass, which formed vigorous patches and was associated with Slender-flowered Muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia tenuiflora</i>). Strangely, neither of these grasses showed any sign of cropping by Deer. <p>
Other herbs not noted previously were Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii </i>), Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema triphyllum </i>), <i>Carex virescens  </i>
and a <i>Carex </i>
of section <i>laxiflorae</i>
. Despite the obvious fertility of the soil, the ground cover was relatively sparse 
and lacked diversity, perhaps as a consequence of the deep shade.<p>
Climbing to a gentler slope we saw Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>), Silvery Glade Fern (<i>Athyrium thelypterioides </i>), the panic grass <i>Panicum boscii</i>
, and curious for this habitat, a small, isolated patch of<i> Leucobryum  </i>
moss. However the only other moss seen along this section of the trail was Delicate 
Fern Moss, a highly adaptable species. Continuing upward, there were abundant Sugar 
Maple and White Ash seedlings, Four-leaved Yam (<i> Dioscorea quaternata</i>), the poisonous fungus <i>Hygrophoropsis aurantiacus</i>
, abundant Hog Peanut, Canada Brome Grass (<i>Bromus purgans </i>), here past its prime, Bottlebrush Grass, Bitternut Hickory (<i>Carya cordiformis </i>), Muscletree and Wood Nettle.<p>
We had now reached a part of the trail on which the aspect was nearly due south and 
a slope on which Twin Grass grew in larger and more frequent patches in association with  with Slender-flowered Muhly. 
Here also were scattered Grape Fern, likely <i>Botrychium dissectum</i>
, Wild Liquorice (<i> Galium circaezans </i>) and Four-leaved Milkweed (<i>Asclepias quadrifolia)</i>
. Numerous Sugar Maple along this slope averaged perhaps a foot (0.3 meter)dbh,while 
Tuliptree,Basswood and scattered Shagbark Hickory were conspicuously larger.<p>
Next recorded as we moved along the trail were the fungus <i>Lactarius piperatus,</i>
 Calico Aster, the meadowrue<i> Thalictrum</i>
 <i>steeleanum</i>
, the fungus <i>Trametes versicolor</i>
, Foam Flower, again abundant Hog Peanut and Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i> Uvularia sessilifolia </i>). Twin Grass
  also continued its trend of increasing abundance and was shortly joined by Basil 
Balm (<i>Monarda clinopodia </i>), Virgin's Bower (<i>Clematis virginiana</i>), the first Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>) seen by us in the Three Forks area, the fungus <i>Clitocybe gibba,</i>
 Enchanters Nightshade (<i>Circaea quadrisulcata </i>) and Great Blue Lobelia. Here also we noted a single small Hemlock, and the first 
and only one seen on the entire traverse. This was followed by a large patch of Oyster 
Mushroom at eye level on a tree, abundant Christmas Fern, Hog Peanut, Twin Grass, Slender-flowered Muhly, White Snakeroot, Lance-leaved Wild Liquorice (<i>Galium lanceolatum</i>), Beaked Dodder (<i> Cuscuta rostrata </i>), <i>Carex aestivalis</i>
  and Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum</i>
 <i>thalictroides </i>). Sugar Maple dominated the canopy here in numbers, and we remarked again on the 
near absence of conspicuous mosses- which had been generally true for the traverse 
so far.<p>
Next encountered were Wild Stonecrop, Summer Grape, and of special interest because 
of its association with limestone soils, Sharplobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica acutiloba </i>). Not far beyond this point a trailside vertical face of sandstone was almost covered 
by Tree Moss (<i> Climacium americanum</i>), which too is frequently found in rich soil areas, although not necessarily calcareous. 
Next seen was the fungus <i>Sarcoscypha occidentalis</i>
, a species frequently found &quot;on wet sticks and fallen branches of damp hardwood forests&quot; 
(Phillips,1991), and then, quite unexpectedly in this southern Appalachian type 
habitat, <i>Carex brunnescens</i>
, a sedge with an Arctic distribution, and here, as is characteristic, on rocks. These 
were followed by the fungi <i>Mycena leaiana</i>
, <i>Amanita vaginata</i>
  and <i>Collybia butyracea</i>
, Wild Columbine (<i>Aqilegia canadensis </i>) and Maidenhair Fern (<i>Adiatum pedatum</i>), both of the last-mentioned species also being characteristic of rich, if not calcareous 
soils.<p>
We now had come to an area of sustantially thinner ground cover, with Cucumbertree, 
Prickly Gooseberry (<i> Ribes cynosbati </i>) and a thick litter of sandstone blocks, a likely indication of a change in lithology 
here or upslope. Following was a short interval of less rock and the first-noted 
Black Birch and Striped Maple of the traverse. Twin Grass
still occurred in small clumps and in another short interval in which there may again 
have been richer soil, we noted <i>Carex plantaginea</i>
, a somewhat demanding forest sedge.Then for still another short interval sanstone 
blocks increased in number again. A spot inventory taken in this interval yielded 
abundant large Tuliptree and Northern Red Oak, with subordinate Black Cherry, Black 
Locust,Cucumbertree and Sugar Maple with an undergrowth of Spice Bush, Virginia Creeper and 
Summer Grape. Then farther along the trail we saw Fraser Magnolia and New York Fern 
in somewhat less rocky terrain. Also noted was Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia</i>
 <i>perfoliata </i>) as was the one and only Bloodroot (<i>Saguinaria canadensis </i>) plant of the traverse. Delicate Fern Moss also was present, and rocks which did 
occur contained species of <i>Brachythecium</i>
, <i>Dicranum ,Anomodon</i>
  and <i>Atrichum  </i>
mosses as well.<p>
Although Twin Grass
 had still occurred as small scattered patches up to this level, it virtually vanished 
above it. However, in a local resurgence of mesic forest we saw the first Yellow 
Buckeye since the initial slope. Accompanying it were Northern Red Oak, Sugar Maple 
saplings and a ground flora that included Broad Beech Fern (<i> Phegopteris hexagonoptera </i>), White Wood Aster, New York Fern and Dutchman's Pipe vine (<i> Aristolochia macrophylla </i>).<p>
It should be mentioned that we had seen neither Beech nor Yellow Buckeye since the 
initial slope and no Red Maple above the valley flat. Here however, a drastic change 
occurred, with the reappearance of Beech, and in the ground flora, Indian Cucumber-root with Mad-dog Skullcap (<i> Scutellaria lateriflora </i>). Not far beyond we also observed the reappearance of Haircap Moss and Red Maple. 
Following these we came upon Autumn Bent grass (<i> Agrostis perennans</i>),Black Chanterelle fungus and the only Umbrella Magnolia of the traverse (and only 
the second in the entire area).<p>
We had now reached very flaggy ground, with the flags as well as larger rocks consisting 
of sandstone. However Tuliptree was large and abundant and accompanied by Northern 
Red Oak, Beech and seedlings of Red Maple. As we neared the end of our traverse we 
recorded more Striped and Sugar Maples,<i> Dicranum  </i>
moss, Round-leaf and Sweet White Violets, Mountain Goldenrod (<i>Solidago roanensis </i>), the Bird Nest fungus <i>Crucibulum laeve</i>
  on a Tuliptree root and the ringing call of a Pileated Woodpecker (<i> Dryocopus pileatus </i>).<p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>

Most of our traverse on the County Line Trail was through clearly rich mesic forest 
that had been developed under colluvial conditions on steep slopes. The rocks that 
yielded this colluvium were probably Bluestone Formation at the spur base and New 
River Formation for most of the traverse. The flora in the upper part of the traverse, that 
reflect more acid soil conditions, as indicated by such species as Red Maple, Beech 
and <i>Medeola  </i>
and a relatively sparse ground cover, are probably attributable to the Kanawha Formation.<p>
It  is significant also that this forest is developed on a slope with an almost due 
south aspect. Moisture appears to be abundant by certain plant and fungal indicators, 
perhaps as a consequence of the water-retaining properties of fine-grained, clay-rich rocks and soils. While the valley flats and smaller flood plains below are rich in 
such acid-soil species as Red Maple, Beech and Great Rhododendron and northerners 
such as Yellow Birch and Canada Mayflower, the colluvial slope has species characteristic 
of circumneutral soils and southern Appalachian habitats. Only one species,<i> Carex brunnescens</i>
, of all those observed, was out of character. Here were Broad Beech Fern rather than 
Northern Beech Fern, the south-ranging species of Enchanters Nightshade rather than 
the northern/alpine species and <i>Monarda clinopodia</i>
  rather than the <i>M. didyma</i>
 of the valley flat.  While the rich mesic character of the slope forest likely follows 
from nutrient-rich rocks and soils developed under moist-climate colluvial conditions, 
its southern appalachian character is probably a consequence of air drainage and the southerly aspect.<p>
The contrast between the flora of the valley flat and the colluvial slope apparently 
extends to their fungi. In the lists and text descriptions of species (not genra) 
identified for these habitats only two, Oyster Mushroom and Black Chanterelle, were 
found in both habitats. While it is likely that a closer study would find more species 
in common, the effect seems real and is supported by the strong affinity between 
a number of the valley species and Beech (Phillips,1991), a tree that is common 
there but virtually missing on the colluvial slope.<p>
A further point of interest is the relatively low number of woody species in this 
rich colluvial forest. This is especially true for shrubs. Great Rhododendron, which 
is common in the valley, is missing here, apparently because conditions are too alkaline. Doubtless there are shrubs we missed, including a likely<i> Cornus</i>
, which was sighted, but does not appear in our notes. For most of the traverse only 
nine species appear regularily in the canopy and do not include Yellow Buckeye,Beech, 
Red Maple and Yellow Birch, which are almost entirely confined to the valley in terrain investigated by us. Nonetheless, taken as a whole, this slope forest appears to 
be markedly more diverse than at least some northern hardwood forests on limestone 
terrain of low relief- a case in point being those examined by us in the Canaan Valley.

Fauna generally noted the first night (9-2-97), which was quite mild, were crickets, 
katydids and a Barred Owl (<i>Strix varia</i>).An unidentified frog was seen in the small springbrook near camp. Chipmunks (<i>Tamias striatus </i>) and Red Squirrels (<i>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus </i>) were seen and heard in the morning. During the first night and the early morning 
of the next day there was a series of showers followed by a drastic fall in temperature. 
Consequently no insects were heard the following day and night, which was quite cold.<p>
