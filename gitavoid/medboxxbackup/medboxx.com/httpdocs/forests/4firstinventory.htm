7-19,20,21-94
Beartown / Chestnut Ridge</h3>
<ul> Steve
Krichbaum and I drove by way of Covington Routes 18, 600, 17, 635, 460, 61Y 16
to FDR 222 and access to the Beartown Wilderness near Tazewell Va. On the way
noted apparent healthy of Hemlock and abundance of <i>Rhododendron maximum</i>
(in bloom) in this part of the mountains. We noted that the lower Roaring Fork
and Laurel Creek Valley were quite mesic with much Tuliptree Black Birch, Yellow Buckeye and <i>R. maximum</i>.
We saw a fine, large accipiter dart through the woods here, probably Coopers
Hawk. We then took FDR 631 from 222 to near the Wilderness boundary where
Kelley Humps stopped us. There we also were visited by Tom Davenport of the
Mountain Heritage Alliance for about an hour's hike. Steve set up his tent,
here at about 3000' asl and I spent the night in the truck. After we cooked,
Steve made an excellent fire and we listened to Whippoorwills and Barred Owls
after retiring. The forest here is rather xeric, developed on yellowish red
silty clay soils Black, Scarlet,
Chestnut Northern Red and White Oak
dominate with Red Maple and Pignut. There is Black Gum and some large Tuliptree
Pignut Black Cherry, Black Locust,
Sourwood Flowering Dogwood, Am.
Chestnut Mt Laurel and a little <i>R.
maximum</i> in the understory. <i>Vaccinium</i> sp including Deerberry are
abundant. <i>Coreopsis major </i>is very common along the road. <i>Lobelia
inflata </i>(in bloom) is present 
Trailing Arbutus is common as is the Mountain Mint (<i>Pycnanthemum
montana </i>) as well as a similar but whitish, fuzzy Mountain Mint of a
different species. We also heard Robins, virios[spel], Whippoorwills and Barred
Owls in the morning. 7-20-94 we began our traverse from camp on FDR 631 to the
shelter on the Appalachian Trail overlooking Burkes Garden. The first leg was
along this road to the Wilderness edge. The forest consists of black, Scarlet Chestnut, White and Northern Red Oak Pignut, Red Maple Black Cherry, Black Locust, Black Gum with
scattered Tuliptree and Cucumber Magnolia. some Chestnut Oaks are very large
and Red Maple is abundant. There is also some Pitch Pine. Sourwood, Flowering
Dogwood and American Chestnut are understory species with some Mt Laurel. Hay
Scented Fern, Bracken Fern, Whorled Loostrife[spel],<i> Coreopsis major</i>,
trailing Arbutus, Deerberry, <i>Vaccinium</i> sp. Teaberry, Wild Indigo and <i>Aster
divaricatus</i>, Service berry occur along the road. We chased up two Turkeys
here, one a chick. On the next leg we ascended Chestnut Ridge from about 3100
ft asl to about 3687 ft asl, the junction with the Appalachian Trail. Black,
Scarlet White Oak remain abundant but
Chestnut Oak begins to fade and Northern
Red Oak becomes more common as does Pignut. Striped Maple appears first! 
There is cucumber Magnolia and some Tuliptree. One Hemlock (healthy) was
seen Service Berry, Deer Berry are
common and <i>Vaccinium</i> <i>corymbosum </i> (Highbush Blueberry) appears.
Here not in wetland (berries dark) Galax is common. Leaves of Pink Ladyslipper
were noted as was<i> Goodyera pubescens</i>, Spotted Wintergreen, Christmas
Fern <i>Aster acuminatus</i> appears.
Red Maple continued abundant and only a few small Sugar Maples were noted Sassafras continues to be abundant. As in
virtually every forest, Four-leaved Wild Yam seems omnipresent Near the top of this leg conditions become
more mesic and White Ash, May Apple and Black Cohosh (sp?) appears. <i>Monarda
clinopodia</i> with white flowers becomes common as does <i>Hypericum punctatum</i>.
Red Oak increases and in one grove there is practically nothing but Pignut.
Just South of the junction with the AT old fields begin and there is much
Hawthorn (with dark green glossy leaves) of unknown species, Black Cherry (
frequently wind broken), Black Locust, Sassafras and scattered Tuliptrees. The
fields, in addition to trees contain Timothy Grass (alien) large patches of <i>Rubus </i>(Blackberry) and <i>Potentilla,</i>
Hazelnut, Bracken Fern. Stunted but healthy looking Tuliptrees here go to 3700'
asl! However, for whatever reason Chestnut Oak disappears at less than 3700' as
would be expected. As we ascend through the old fields Northern Red Oak and
White Ash become more common. Tuliptrees appear to be left behind. Red Maple
remains common. The next leg begins at about 4000 ft asl where fields give way
to woodland again. At near 4200 ft the trail enters a forest of Northern Red
Oak, White Oak White Ash, Red Maple,
Black Cherry and for the first time Yellow Birch. Mountain Maple, Service
Berry, Wild Raisin <i>Vaccinium
corymbosum</i> and <i>Rhododendron maximum</i> [and] Hawthorn form the
understory. One bush of <i>R catawbiense </i>was also noted. The<i> R maximum </i>was
in bloom but the <i>R catawbiense </i>was forming seed capsules. In one place
there was a small grove of Beech and some Sugar Maples. Many of the large oaks
in this high elevation forest appear to be dead or dying No sign of the Gypsy Moth was seen.Various <i>Rubus
</i>(sp?) are abundant as is Cinnamon Fern and Witchhazel. Some Black Birch and
curiously one Tuliptree!! were seen. Tuliptree at 4200' asl! One small Mountain
Ash and a Mountain Ash seedling were seen. Unidentified Azaleas are present.
American Chestnut and Cucumber Magnolia also were noted as was <i>Ilex Montana</i>,
Pignut and <i>Lyonia ligustrina</i>. Hazelnut sp? is common. Low <i>Vaccinium</i>
including Southern Mountain Cranberry (<i>V</i> <i>erythrocarpum</i>), 
Teaberry, <i>Athyrium felix femina </i>(?) Christmas Fern, Lovage (?), Pale
Jewelplant[weed], Plume Lily (sp?),one Fire Pink,<i> Geranium maculatum Veronica officinalis, Hypericum punctatum</i>
(?) <i> Maianthemum canadense, Aralia
nudicaulis </i> Indian Cucumberroot, <i>Galax,
Aster acuminatus Convallaria montana,</i>
lush Haircap Moss and Four-leaved Yam among other plants form a lush ground
cover. Under the Beech <i>Aster acuminatus,</i> <i>Maianthemum canadense,</i>
and Galax occur with an unknown monocot with flattened parallelogram-shaped
leaves in part flat against the ground and glaberous on both sides but dark
green on top and grayish-green on the bottom. <i>Convallaria </i>also occurs
here as does Plume Lily. A Catbird called here. <i>Monarda clinopodia</i> also
occurs here.

<h3>
Roaring
Fork / Beartown After our return from Chestnut Ridge</h3>
<ul>


 Steve collected a Chicken
of the Woods (<i>Polyporus sulphureus</i>) which I sauteed for supper-an
excellent meal
<p>On the 21 we hiked the mile to Roaring
Fork on the extention of FDR 631 into the Beartown Wilderness, a road being
reclaimed by the forest. At first this walk is through xeric forest as already
described. Turkey and Scarlet Tanagers were noted as were virios[spel.]. Along
this trail <i>Lycopodium</i> spp (<i>lucidulum,</i> <i>flabelliforme</i>) with
Galax The forest appears to be about 50
yrs old here. It gradually becomes more mesic with Hay Scented Fern and
seedlings of Fraser Magnolia, also more Red Oak and Red Oak seedlings.
Tuliptree, many as double sprouts is abundant and first! Striped Maple appears.
Pignut is common and Hemlock increases. <i>Viola rotundifolia</i> is common on
shaded banks as is Christmas Fern. Large Northern Red Oaks appear and there is
a patch of <i>Convallaria montana. Uvularia perfoliata</i> occurs and <i>Aralia
nudicaulis</i> appears. The soil here is a red-brown silty loam with a 6 inch
organic (mor) layer on top. Red Maple remains common. As we approach Roaring
Fork <i>Rhododendron maximum </i>and Hemlock (no Adelgid but diseased
nevertheless) increase. Black Gum occurs and many large Cucumber and Fraser
Magnolias join Tuliptree and Black Birch and Northern Red Oak. Finally Yellow
Birch becomes the dominant tree at the stream. <i>Ilex montana</i> and <i>Viburnum
alnifolium, R maximum</i>, Witchhazel form the understory. A few American (?)
Basswood were noted. Ground cover consists of Clearplant[weed] <i>Heuchera </i>(?),
Horse Balm, <i>Trillium erectum</i>(?) Indian Cucumberroot, Agrimony (sp?), <i>Aster
divaricatus, Astert acuminatus, Viola </i>(sp) incl. <i>V rotundifolia,</i> <i>Thalictrum</i>
(sp?) <i>Zizia aurea</i> (?) Chantrell mushroom. A Wood Thrush called We saw
no fish in the stream which tumbles over flat rocks
<p>
 The overall aspect of this walk,
essentially along the 3100 ft contour passes from typical Appalachian xeric
forest to a more northern / high elevation type forest near the stream probably
due to the moist and cool conditions in this narrow valley below the high
mountains to the north from which cool air can drain. Also northern aspect!


</ul>
<h3>
7-29,30,31-94
Skidmore Rendezvous</h3>
<ul>
Steve and I drove to
Skidmore Fork, where Gus and I had been on June 29-30 for VFWs midsummer
rendezvous. Also attending were Charlie Sullivan, Dennis Hendricks Tracy Hickson, Mark Barker[spel?], Mike
Jones, Ed Lytwak, and Jason Halbert of Save Americas Forests. Not long after
arrival at the same clearing Gus and I had camped and after fording the high
roaring stream at the cement slab culvert, we had a very intense shower. However
it gradually cleared in the evening and we enjoyed a good fire Steve as usual
made. The next day (July 30) everyone but Dennis, Tracy and I hiked up the fork
to see the ancient forest as Gus and I had done. I decided not to ford the
stream and stay behind to botanize around camp Very abundant is a twining
Desmodium? I haven't identified the species 
no! This is <i>Amphicarpa bracteata </i> ("Hog Peanut") !!
finally identified at Muellers Mtn on 8-24-94 
Its quite common here in mesic areas
<p> As remarked previously the forest around camp is open due
to removal of Gypsy Moth-killed oaks. What remains is mostly Hemlock and White
Pine with scattered Shagbark and Pignut Hickories, White (?) Basswood, Black
Locust, Sycamore, Red and Sugar Maple, White Ash, some quite large. Undergrowth
trees are very abundant Striped Maple, Flowering Dogwood There is some Mtn Fetterbush and Spice Bush.
Black Raspberry and Blackberry (in ripe fruit) are common.<i> Potentilla</i> is
everywhere creeping across the rocky soil and Partridge Berry and <i>Maianthemum</i>
<i>canadense</i> are very common especially under Hemlock. In some places there
is abundant Star Flower With them is
abundant <i>Carex platyphylla, Asplenium platyneuron,</i> White Snakeroot is
very abundant <i> Hepatica americana </i>and
Gaywings (niether in bloom) accompany Partridge Berry and <i>M. canadense</i>
in places. There are lush patches of <i>Hedeoma pulegioides</i> (Wild
Pennyroyal), and Columbine is abundantly scattered throughout <i>Galium circaezans </i>(Wild
liquorice[spel.]) is common<i> Impatiens capensis</i> (Orange Jewelplant[weed]) occurs in some moist areas as [does] a <i>Polygonum</i> (sp? Also seen was a patch of Bottle brush Grass,
large clump of a large<i> Panicum</i>, a Dogbane, <i>Panicum dichotomum </i> Virginia Creeper occurs in a few places as
does <i>Uvularia perfoliata</i>, One plant of<i> Polypodium vulgare</i> (<i>P.
virginianum</i>) was found on a steep mossy bank Christmas Fern is also common throughout Lobelia inflata 9in bloom) <i>Campnula
divaricata, Hieracium paniculatum</i> Clearplant[weed], a little Bloodroot, <i>Specularia
perfoliata</i> Indian Pipe, <i>Gnaphalium
obtusifolium </i>occur in some places an Enchanters Nightshade that appears to
be <i>Circaea alpina </i>is abundant.It has all <i>C alpina</i> characteristics
except prominant tubers on its roots 
Then its <i>C quadrisulcata</i> <i>Lobelia
inflata</i> (in bloom) Old Man of the Woods mushrooms are very common and
chantrelles[spel] were noted We heard a
few Whippoorwills and I heard a Catbird Mosses are quite abundant and in some places
there are patches of dark green-yellowish Sphagnum-like moss (This is <i>Climacium
americanum.</i>) We saw a single female Gypsy Moth almost dead on the ground 
<p>
 Northern characteristics here are shown by the abundance of
<i>Maianthemum canadense,</i> Star Flower 
possible <i>Circea</i>[spel.] <i>alpina</i>(?) No <i>Aralia nudicaulis </i>or
Poison Ivy were noted in this entire area. Also no <i>Gaultheria</i>
<p> As is usual the valley floor consists of flat sandstone
cobble stones and during dry weather the stream flows out of site[spel.] beneath these. As usual also
there is evidence of frequent channel shifting in the form of dry channels. We
noted again the clouds of minute yellow flying and hopping biting insects with
small black eyes that I'd never seen elsewhere.

<h3>
8-14-94 Survey Clayton Mill
Springs Special Interest Area-Biologic and Vicinity 1700-1800 ft asl</h3>
<ul>

 
 Mike Jones, Steve Krichbaum and R F Mueller
of Virginians for Wilderness and Shay Clanton made a rapid survey of the
Clayton Mill Springs Special Interest Area-Biologic and vicinity. We followed
the first major branch of Clayton Mill Creek upstream to the spring source in
the SIA. The first reach of this branch passes close to the cutting unit #4 of
the proposed Marble Valley Timber Sale. We also followed the diversion branch
downstream to the road from the spring area and explored further in the upland
forest of the Project area and along Forest Road 1676.
<p>
The immediate vicinity of the lower branch stream, where it
joins the main stem of Clayton Mill Creek, is quite rich, perhaps near
circumneutral (near pH 7) in mesic forest. However virtually the entire area
upstream along the branch is quite acidic though still mesic (medium moist) in
character. Because of prevalent good drainage however, there are no true hydric
conditions except in the stream bed. The stream bed, which consists of coarse
flagstones and cobbles is up to 10 meters in width but the rapidly-flowing
water is usually only a decimeter or less in depth. The many protruding rocks
and boulders and down trees of the stream course are covered with a rich growth
of mosses, liverworts and lichens through which grow a variety of flowering
plants to be discussed later.


<p>The branch stream flows between a quite high banks through
an essentially upland forest dominated by Northern Red Oak, Scarlet Oak, Black
Oak, Chestnut Oak and White Oak with minor Black Gum, red Maple, Sassafras,
Pignut Hickory and Pitch Pine. Hemlock, White Pine, Tuliptree, Black Birch, Red
Maple and Northern Red Oak are concentrated near the stream where they reach
large sizes. No Striped Maple? American Chestnut (<i> Castanea</i> <i>dentata</i>) occurs as sprouts. understory shrubs and trees in the upland forest include
Mountain Laurel (<i> Kalmia latifolia</i>), Minibush[spel.] (<i>Menziesia
pilosa</i>) and Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus florida</i>). Ground cover
includes Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>), Spotted Wintergreen (C<i>himaphilla
maculata</i>), Roundlobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatcas americana</i>), Rattlesnake
plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens </i>), Pink Ladyslipper (<i> Cypripedium
acaule</i>], partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>) Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa uniflora</i>) and
Indian Tobacco (<i> Lobelia inflata </i>). The lower, more mesic part of the
stream also includes, in addition to the above species, Cucumber Magnolia (<i>Magnolia
acuminata </i>), White Ash, Beech and Basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>) with
an understory of Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya virginiana</i>), Spice Bush (<i>Lindera
benzoin </i>), Redbud (<i>Cercis canadensis</i>) and Witchhazel (<i>Hamamelis
virginiana</i>). Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus radicans </i>] and Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus
quinquefolia</i>) are common vines. Additional species in the ground cover are
Common Speedwell (<i>Veronica officianalis</i>[spel.]), Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga
racemosa </i>), Jack-in-the-pulpit (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>), Wild
Geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>). White Snakeroot (<i> Eupatorium rugosum
</i>), Avens (<i>Geum </i>sp), Tick Trefoils (<i>Desmodium </i>spp) Gall-of-the-Earth (<i>Prenanthes </i>sp), 
White Wood Aster (<i>Aster divaricatus</i>), Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea
quaternata </i>), among others.


<p>Along the middle and upper reaches on stream banks are
shrubs such as Spicebush, Mountain Laurel and Mountain Rosebay (R<i>hododendron
catawbiense </i>). On the forest floor is very abundant Partridge Berry and
Indian Cucumberroot (<i>Medeola virginiana </i>) and the northern / high
elevation species Wild Sarsaparilla (<i> Aralia nudicaulis</i>), here at
1700-1800 ft asl, are common. Here also we saw the related American Spikenard (
<i>Aralia racemosa </i>) as well as a few plants of Roundleaf Violet (<i>Viola
rotundifolia</i>) Wild Comfrey (<i>Cynoglossum
virginianum</i>), Wild Liquorice[spel.] (<i>Galium circaezans</i>) and
Enchanters Nightshade (<i>Circaea </i>sp.). Fern species include Christmas
Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides </i>) 
Ebony Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium</i> <i>platyneuron</i>) and Marginal
Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>). 
<p>Growing from the moss covered rocks of the stream bed are
patches of Partridge Berry, Miterwort (<i>Mitella diphylla</i>), Bedstraw (<i>Galium</i>
sp.), Clearplant[weed] (Probably <i>Pilea pumila</i>), Sedges (<i>Carex</i>
sp.) and the Small Green Wood Orchid (<i>Habenaria clavellata</i>) (in bloom
). in one place a little Pennsylvania Bittercress (<i>Cardamine pensylvanicum</i>
) was found, although not thriving in these acid waters. An unidentified dicot
 (This is <i>Samolus parviflorus</i> [as id.] 8-24-94) was also observed at
this location
<p>The vicinity of the stream source springs is rich in ferns
including New York Fern (<i> Thelypteris novaboracensis</i>) Beech Fern (T
hexagonoptera), Hay Scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia</i> <i>punctilobula</i>), 
Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>) and Goldies Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris
Goldiana</i>). Flowering plants include White Snakeroot, Jewel plant[Jewelweed]
and sedges (<i> Carex </i>spp) as well as mosses and liverworts.
<p>The presence of butternut (<i>Juglans cinerea</i>) was
again confirmed along Forest Road 1676 in the Project Area
<p>On 8-24-94 Hoagie and I went
to Clayton Mill Spring, she to paint, I to botanize. We ascended the third
branch of Clayton Mill Creek which flows from the Northwest just upstream from
the diversion branch. As the first branch discussed previously the streamside
forest here is dominated by Tuliptree, Hemlock, Black Birch and Northern Red
Oak and Red Maple. There appears to be less White Pine however. Seedlings of
White Ash were noted. The area seems a bit less acid than the first branch.
Spice Bush is very abundant and a patch of Paw Paw was noted. Witchhazel is
also abundant and one Black Haw Viburnum was noted. There is some Flowering
Dogwood, a little Mtn. Laurel and no Rhododendron. A few Beech and Pignuts were
seen. Only one small plant of a <i>Vaccinium</i> was noted and the upland
forest is free of ericaceous shrubs by and large. The stream rocks are heavily
covered with mosses which have flowering plants and ferns growing through them.
One rock a foot in dimension had a heavy growth of mosses, with
Clearplant[weed], Partridge Berry, <i>Viola </i>sp. <i>Galium triflorum Mitella diphylla</i> and Christmas Fern. Partridge
Berry is very abundant, especially under the Hemlocks which appear suffering
from some disease (but not Adelgid). Clearplant[Clearweed] is also very
abundant in all moist spots as is <i>Galium triflorum </i>and other bedstraws
but <i>Mitella </i>is less abundant compared with the first branch; and only a
few <i>Habenaria clavellata</i> were seen on stream rocks.<i> Laportia
canadensis</i> is quite common. <i>Aralia nudicaulis,</i> Spotted Wintergreen
and <i>Goodyera pubescens </i>are all unusually abundant along the dryer areas.
Virginia Creeper is common and there is some Poison Ivy as distinguished from
the first branch. Smilax sp is scattered about but sparse. Other herbs include
Four leaved yam, Pink Ladyslipper, and a few Black Cohosh, probably <i>Cimicifuga
racemosa. Aster divaricatus</i> increases downstream where it's more mesic.
There are also a few small patches of <i>Cardamine
pensylvanicum</i> on stream rocks and here again a single plant of Water
Pimpernel (<i>Samolus parviflorus</i>) in bloom-as in the first branch.<i>
Samolis parviflorus </i>is an unusual species here since it also occurs in
brackish waters as well asin the mountains 
 Indian Cucumberroot] is common
but not as in the first branch. Also possible <i>Carex conjuncta</i> was noted.
<p>Ferns are abundant and diverse here. most widespread is
Christmas fern although not as abundant as New York Fern. others are Hayscented
Fern, Beech Fern (<i>Thelypteris hexagonoptera </i>), <i>Dryopteris spinulosa</i>,
Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium aspenoides </i>), Interrupted Fern, and a single
rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium</i> <i>virginianum </i>). 
<p> We saw a high flying raptor, heard Piliated Woodpeckers and
saw one small brown salamander scurry across the damp leaves. One apparently
viable Gypsy Moth egg mass was seen. I also saw a hatch of small Mayflies (?)
high above the bushes along the spring. The weather was perfect for our efforts
with pleasant cool, dry air and partly sunny skies.

8-28-94
Bald Knob Proposed S. I. A. (Elevation 4225' asl) SW Aspect + Falling Springs
Falls
</h3>
<ul>


 Mike Jones and I visited Bald
Knob, hiking to the top from the junction with State Road 703 the airport
access. The general aspect is of a stunted Northern Red Oak-Pine Heath. At the
junction where we parked our truck at ~3898' asl, we saw a single Tuliptree,
the only one we saw on the entire mountain. Tuliptree out of place! Other trees
are Northern Red oak, Black Birch, Pitch Pine, Black Locust, Mountain Ash, Fire
Cherry Striped Maple Shrubs are Witchhazel Bear Oak 
<i>Aronia melanocarpa</i>, Mountain Laurel,<i> Rhododendron catawbiense</i>
and various blueberries (<i> Vaccinium pallidum</i> ?). Is abundance of <i>R.
catawbiense </i>here correlated with the rockiness ? A little stunted Spotted Knapweed[?] The land is very rocky with large blocks of
quartzite. At the area of the road junction there is a beautiful unidentified
Goldenrod with a dark purple-brown angular stem, glaberous, also much Sweet
Fern, some White Snakeroot, Teaberry, Trailing Arbutus. There are some American
Chestnut sprouts and Bracken Fern. Stunted Sassafras is common-indeed to the
highest elevations of 4225' asl. Along the road to the electronic tower on top,
the most common herbaceous species are Whorled Loostrife[spel] and Southern
Bellflower (<i>Campanula divaricata </i>). Blackberries of unidentified
species are common and White Oak sprouts. No Black Gum seen Witchhazel seems to thrive here! as does Bear Oak some of which are 6"
thick Other species are Plume Lily, <i>Convallaria montana, Aster Macrophyllus,
Hieracium paniculatum, Prenanthes serpentaria, Melampyrum lineare</i> and <i>Menziesia
pilosa</i>. About half way to the top <i>Aster acuminatus </i>and a little
farther on <i>Aralia nudicaulis</i> appeared. other species noted here in
addition to those listed below are <i>Gillenia trifoliata, Ribes</i> <i>rotundifolia,</i>
Black Cherry, Black Huckleberry Ha[z]elnut (sp?), Spreading Dogbane (in bloom),
Virginia Creeper, Hawthorn (sp?), <i>Smilax rotundifolia Letuca</i>[spel] <i>canadensis</i> [Wild
Lettuce], Upland Willow (one bush) <i>Solidago curtisii</i> likely from
photo A little <i>Lycopodium
flabelliform</i> ? was noted in several places There are a few, probably planted spruce on
top. In one place there is a small grove of Beech. The stunted forest on top
consists of Northern Red Oak (dominant) Bear Oak, Witchhazel, Mountain Holly
 (<i>Ilex montana </i>). <i>Menziesia,</i> Mountain Ash, Wild Raisin, Catawba
Rhododendron, Mountain Laurel 
Blackberries, Striped Maple, Black Birch, a little Yellow Birch. A bush
of <i>Lyonia ligustrina </i>(?) was also seen. A large purple-stemmed
umbelliferous plant with inflated petioles, perhaps <i>Angelica triquinata</i>
is common along the road. In the forest underneath the low stunted trees <i>Maianthemum
canadense, Convallaria, Aster acuminatus,</i> <i>Aralia nudicaulis,</i> Tea
Berry and Hay Scented Fern grow among moss and lichen covered quartzite blocks.
No poison Ivy was seen Noted an azalea,
perhaps <i>R. roseum </i>(pubescent underleaves along top) Farther on, on a slightly northern aspect, <i>Polypodium
virginianum</i> is very abundant in the forest.There are also clumps of a dark
green round ? grass with tall culms, possibly <i>Deschampsia flexuosa</i>.
Unknown species of Blueberries are common, as is Black Huckleberry. Pink
Ladyslipper and a Clematis (sp?) were noted. A single White Pine and a single
Virginia Pine seedling were seen. Va Pine out of place! There appears to be no
sweet Fern on top. No Partridge Berry or <i>Potentilla</i> were seen, but there
are a number of unidentified species of Goldenrod in addition to that noted
earlier. Four-leaved Yam is also present at the highest elevations 
<p> On our way in we overshot and ended up
seeing the exceptionally beautiful Falling Springs Falls.

9-4-94
Paddy Knob
</h3>
<ul>


 Steve Krichbaum and I made a trip to Paddy Knob and also noted
changes in the Forest with elevation. Our first station was at the junction of
Route 84 and FR 55 at an elevation of 3175' asl. There we met Joe Robertson of
6248 Brewda[spel?] Ct. Huntington, W Va 25705-2406 who was sympathetic to our
efforts and wanted information. The forest here is rather dry oak with White
Oak, Scarlet Oak, Pignut, White Pine, flowering Dogwood, Mtn Laurel, Bracken
Fern Continuing up the road toward Paddy
Knob we encountered Chestnut Oak, Am. Chestnut sprouts, Sassafras, red Maple,
Flowering Dogwood (here at ~3300' asl), Sugar Maple Hemlock (healthy looking), Striped Maple,
White Oak Chestnut Oak occurs at perhaps
at least 4000' asl here where northern Red Oak begins to dominate. Butternut
seems relatively common at these high elevations where the soil seems to
improve and more moisture is available
<p> We began a hike from the junction of
FR 55 and FR 141 from a sign saying "Bird Run" toward the SE into the
GWNF. Here Black Cherry, Shagbark, Sugar Maple, Northern Red Oak, White Ash, a
few Black Oak, Butternut, Striped Maple, Alternate leaved Dogwood Hawthorn sp, Pignut, Hazelnut sp., a little <i>Menziesia</i>,
Blackberry sp, Am Chestnut sprouts, Black Birch, Black Locust, a little
Cucumber Magnolia occur at about 4200' asl. No White Oak here at 4200' A <i>Viola </i>sp is very common with
varigated[spel?] leaves. White Snakeroot, <i>Aster acuminatus</i>, <i>Cimicifuga
racemosa </i> (not <i>C americana </i>) <i>Potentilla canadensis </i>(?), sedges,
Indian Cucumberroot, a little<i> Maianthemum canadense, Galium triflorum</i>,
Hay Scented Fern, <i>Aralia nudicaulis</i> and a little Whorled
Loostrife[spel.] are on the forest floor
 An azalea, either Flame or <i>R. Roseum</i>,
also occurs here. Farther down FR 141 we saw White Basswood, many Am. Chestnut
sprouts, red Maple, Witchhazel, and<i> Solidago graminifolia, Impatiens
pallida,</i> Service Berry sp., <i>Rudbeckia hirta</i>. We then entered the
woods to the east. This is quite dry oak forest near the road and contains Wood
Betony, Four leaved Yam, <i>Convallaria montana, Aralia</i> <i>nudicaulis, </i>Bracken
Fern, Blueberry sp, Cancerroot (Conopholis <i>americana</i>) occur here.
Farther up the hill away from the road, moister and / or soil nutrients
increase and it becomes more mesic. <i>Melanthium parviflorum</i> occurs here <i>Collinsonia
canadensis</i> and <i>Polygonum virginianum </i>are common in Northern Red Oak,
Red Maple and Beech forest. Another small pink and white flowered <i>Polygonum</i>
also occurs<i> Uvularia perfoliata, Dryopteris marginalis </i>Maple leaf
viburnum also occur. On the way back, along the road we noted Black Elderberry
and Oswego Tea.
<p> On the top of Paddy Knob [~4400' asl]
is a stunted forest obviously regrown from agriculture and much degraded. It
consists of much Hawthorn including <i>Crataegus punctata </i> Northern Red Oak, Yellow Birch and Black
Cherry are also abundant. Striped and Mountain Maple and Black Birch occur.
Undergrowth includes <i>Ribes rotundifolia 
Cimicifuga racemosa</i>, Jack in the Pulpit, <i>Melanthium parvifolium</i>,
Jewelplant[Jewelweed] sp. An umbelliferous plant possibly <i>Angelica
triquinata,</i> is common. Black Locust 
is common here at ~4400' asl 
Across FR 55, in the Monongahela NF, the forest is a little larger. Here
we saw Interrupted Fern, one <i>Christmas Fern, New York Fern, Hay </i>Scented
Fern, a little<i> Maianthemum canadense </i>under Red Oak and Sugar Maple with
Hay Scented Fern, a little Indian Cucumberroot, <i>Galium triflorum</i>. There
are large fire (?) scarred trees including large Northern Red Oak Black Oak? and Black Birch here all at
~4300'asl. In the open there are many Blackberries and some Hazelnuts [or] <i>Corylus
americana</i>
<p> We then drove slowly back down toward
Route 84. At one point we saw a beautiful Coopers Hawk perched in roadside
trees
<p>We then walked about 1/4 mile down FR
431 into the Monongahela. The elevation here is ~3700' asl We noted Northern
Red Oak, American Basswood, Striped Maple, Black Birch, Chestnut Oak, Red
Maple, <i>Impatiens pallida</i>, Cucumber Magnolia, Sugar Maple <i>Aster Macrophyllus,</i> Mtn Laurel, Deer
Berry (with many large unripe berries) 
<p> Species not seen on this entire
mountain this day are Black Gum, Teaberry, Spotted Wintergreen and<i> Goodyera</i>.
Sassafras seems confined to the lower slopes but we may have missed this
species However we saw none of the
colored leaves associated with Black Gum.

Smoke Hole 
</h3>
<ul>

 Steve Krichbaum and I went to
the Smoke Hole area of the Monongahela NF to meet R Hunsucker and to see Cedar Glades
etc. We met Hunsucker and his friend Dottie at the Big Bend Campground from
where we proceeded upstream to Eagle Rock where we camped on private land. In
the afternoon of the 6th we made a foray through Upper Tract to a spot on
Highway 8 about 5 miles SW of Upper Tract. From there we hiked into the
mountains to find a supposed Cedar Glade at the end of Forest Road 889. On the
way in we saw an Osprey above the South Fork of the Potomac The woods here was typical upland oak forest
but with much Dittany (<i> Cunila origanoides </i>) in beautiful blue bloom
even in the dark forest. We found the Cedar glade to be too degraded to study.
The climb here was difficult for me partly because of an ingrown toenail.[repaired
by Dottie later!] We had a delightful campfire that evening and Hunsucker
recited some of the Cedar glade species he had found above Eagle Rock at the
grove top about 600 ft above the South Fork. These included <i>Solidago
ulmifolia, H. harrisii,</i> <i>Guercus muehlenbergii, Juniperus virginianus,
Acer saccharum,</i> White Ash, Hophornbeam Red Bud 
<i>Carex pennsylvanica, Paronychia virginica, Antennaria virginica,
Danthonia spicata, Elymus hystrix 
Taenidia montana, T integerrima, Pellaea atropurpurea </i> Nodding Onion 
Virginia Pine Pitch Pine. Of
course this list is secondhand from Hunsucker who couldn't remember all the
details of association etc. The campground we stayed at is owned by Harlan
Kimble (304) 358-3171 who gave me permission to visit again.
<p> The next day (9-7-94), I scouted the
river shore near camp and saw a number of small (~2 inch) fish with striped
backs who would dart from hiding places in the cobbles to other[s] farther out.
But these were probably not darters since they were suspended above the bottom
when still I also saw a somewhat larger,
clear patterned fish with a prominent black vertical band at the end of its
tail. There were also insects in what appears to be nuptual[spel.] flights and
coiled gastropods in the stream. The bank is rich in Paw Paws <i>Commelina communis</i>, The Asiatic
Dayflower is common on the shore. <i>Scrophularia marilandica</i> also occurs
along the River. We then drove back to U.S 220 and went NE to Landes where we
headed into the mountains About 2 miles
NW of Landes we encountered our first Cedar glade with <i>Quercus muehlenbergi</i>[<i>i</i>],
Va Juniper <i> Carex eburnea, Solidago
ulmifolia, Onosmodium hispidissimum, Antennaria virginica</i>. In adjacent oak
forest we saw <i>Senecio obovatus</i> and<i> Draba ramsissima</i> ("Rock
Twist"). We then drove farther into the mountains over a very rough and
steep road and after a substantial hike ended up virtually on the gorge rim of
the South Fork with a splendid view North. Here was the Cedar glade Hunsucker
examined in detail in 3 quadrates. This is more like a "Limestone
Barren" according to TNC The glade
is very open, trees mostly Va Juniper with scattered Chinquapin Oak, especially
on the margins Black Walnut, Black
Locust, Hophornbeam, Red Bud, White Ash<i> Celtis occidentalis</i>, some White,
Pitch and Va Pines on edges. Much of the
area between the trees is covered with grass, much of it tall. Especially
conspicuous is Yellow Indian Grass (<i>Sorghastrum</i>
<i>nutans </i>) which was in flower, also Little Bluestem (<i>Andropogon </i> <i>scoparius </i>) and Big Bluestem (<i>A.
gerardi</i>) and <i>Panicum lanuginosum</i>]. 
See Braun 1950 p 248 for similar community Hidden in these grasses are many small plants
including <i>Senecio</i> <i>obovatus, Phlox subulata</i>, Oxeye Daisy,<i> Viola</i>
sp<i> Aristolochia serpentaria</i> (Virginia Snakeroot), <i>Galium </i>sp, <i>Anemone
virginiana</i>, Nodding Onion, Hog Peanut, Bloodroot, Aster undulatus, <i>Aster
pilosus, Veronica officianalis</i>[spel.], Sweet Yellow Clover, <i>Symphoricarpos
orbiculatus, Hypericum prolificum, Hypocynum cannabinum</i> (Indian Hemp), <i>Lithospermum
canescens</i> (Orange Puccoon) <i>Blephhilia
ciliata,</i> Black Medic Clover, <i>Viola saggitata, Lespediza nuttalli,
Bouteloua curtipendula</i> (Side Oats Grama) (an indicator), <i>Poa
compressa</i> (Canadian Bluegrass, an alien), <i>Linum sulcatum,</i> Indian
plantain sp <i>Hygrophorus coccineus</i>
 (a mushroom) and a number of unidentified mosses. Goldfinch were seen and
later Steve and I were affected by what we took to be "Chiggers" the
effect of which was to cause welts due to intense itching under arms, crotch
etc. but not until on our way home. These presumably were part of the Cedar
glade ecology, but one I'd never experienced before! I also explored the
surrounding forest which had many pignut and Shagbark Hickories with Chinquapin
Oaks, Hophornbeam etc. There on a rock we also saw the fern <i>Pellaea
atropurpurea </i> (Purple Cliff Brake) 
on a limestone outcrop. The soil in the Cedar glade is dark brown, clay, and
organic rich loam. It was quite moist.

Crawford Mtn.
</h3>
<ul>


 Steve K, Mike Jones and I hiked up Crawford Mtn. from Route 688. At this point the
elevation is about 2600 ft asl. From there we climbed about 1000 ft to the
junction with the Chimney Hollow Trail at elevation a little above 3600' asl.
This trail is then generally a southern aspect. At 2600' to a alight bench at
3200' asl the forest is typical xeric ericaceous oak forest with mostly
Chestnut Oak, Northern Red, Scarlet, Black, White and a little Bear Oak, Black
Gum, Red Maple Sassafras. Pitch and
White Pine Black Locust[.] Pignut
Hickory, (Carya glabra and C ovalis) is quite abundant and increases toward
the top. Chestnut sprouts are present. Shrubs include Mtn Laurel, Deer Berry
(in fruit), <i>Vaccinium pallidum 
Spiraea corymbosa </i>Black
Huckleberry maple leaf Viburnum. Striped
Maple becomes more common upward. Other species are Sweet Fern, <i>Solidago
bicolor</i>, <i>Solidago </i>spp, Southern Bellflower, <i>Liatris graminifolia</i>,
Bracken Fern, Wild Indigo, <i>Aster liniarifolius</i>[spel.],[ Here at ~2700'
to 2800' asl], <i>Potentilla canadensis</i>(?), Spotted Wintergreen, a very
little teaberry, <i>Lespediza</i>[spel.] spp, Birds Foot Violet, Mouse ear
Hawkweed, Three Seeded Mercury sp(?), <i>Cunila origanoides</i>, <i>Hedeoma
pulegioides</i>, Avens sp, Hog Peanut, <i>Desmodium rotundifolium, Sedum</i>
sp. Nodding Onion, <i>Veronica officianalis</i>[spel.]. At the 3200 ft bench
the forest becomes more mesic, Black Locust increases, Black Birch, White Ash,
Hophornbeam appear. Striped Maple increases. <i>Cimicifuga racemosa, Agrimonia
gryposepala,</i> Virginia Creeper, Poison Ivy <i>Anemone virginiana</i>, Lambs
Quarters, a <i>Heuchera</i> sp. <i>Dryopteris marginalis</i> Indian
Plantane[spel.], <i>Carex</i> sp. <i>Juncus</i> sp, Bottlebrush grass, all
appear. A dogwood, much browsed by deer, probably <i>Cornus racemosa</i>,
appears. Hawthorns are common. Upward <i>Tilia heterophylla,</i> Service Berry
sp a few Hemlock, Black Cherry, and Slipery[spel] Elm! Staghorn Sumac and
definitely <i>Cornus racemosa </i>appears. Few Northern herbaceous species No <i>Aralia nudicaulis Maianthemum canadense</i> (not acid enough
) No <i>Viburnum alnifolium</i> No <i>Cimicifuga americana </i>In one place
Tall grasses (sp unknown) extend beneath small oaks. however many trees
appear to be about 100 to 125 yrs old (~29" dbh). Pignut, Hophornbeam,
Northern Red Oak, Striped Maple all increase, Chestnut Oak decreases. White
Snakeroot becomes common. Hoary Mtn Mint (<i>Pycnanthemum incanum </i>)
appears. Chestnut Oak disappears between about 3400' and 3500' asl. No
Sassafras or Black Gum were seen at the higher elevations above 3200' asl. Near
and on top Sugar Maple and Butternut appear and Hophornbeam and Striped Maple
are very abundant as is White Snakeroot and <i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>. Clear
Plant[weed] also appears and White Basswood is common. Pignut Hickory is one of
the most common large trees. The largest trees are Northern Red Oak (dbh>
30") some likely more than 150 yrs old. Large Black Birch and White Ash
are also common. <i>Pinus virginiana</i> and <i>Cornus racemosa</i> and Coral
Berry are abundant as is Witchhazel. 
<p>Other
species near or on top are Four leaved Yam, <i>Thalictrum</i> <i>clavatum,</i>
Alternate leaved dogwood, much Hog Peanut. One possible Black Oak ~12' dbh was
seen. Large White Oaks are common at 3500' asl <i>Polygonum cristatum </i>is common
vining over other plants. Ravens and a raptor with a voice like a Redtail were
heard. Juncos were seen. Just above RT 688 near the trail we saw a beautiful
Northern Copperhead which we photographed.

Benson Run / Shenandoah Mtn.
</h3>
<ul>


 Mike Jones, Steve Krichbaum and I drove to the Deerfield
Valley then up Forest Road 173 to the top of Shenandoah Mtn, then down to
Benson Run at 2600' asl. We then hiked up the Right Prong (SE prong) to perhaps
3300 ft asl. Where we parked (at ~2600' asl) there is a fairly rich rocky
bottom land with, as usual for these mountains, a number of old channels and
abrupt natural levees. The forest is dominated by Hemlock here much defoliated
by some agent, but no sign of the Adelgid! Other trees are White Pine,Red and
Sugar Maple, Black Birch, a few Yellow Birch, White Basswood and at least one
apparent American Basswood, Black Locust, a few Tuliptrees, Beech Chestnut Oak, Northern Red Oak, White Ash,
Cucumber Magnolia. There are a few Flowering Dogwood, <i>Sambucus canadensis,</i>
Striped Maples. There are some impressive Shagbark Hickories Virginia Creeper is common and there is a
little Poison Ivy and some Grape Vines(sp?). Clearplant[weed] dominates the
ground cover and Hay scented Fern is abundant as is Christmas fern, Partridge
Berry <i>Galium triflorum,</i> a <i>Potentilla</i>
 (<i>simplex </i>or<i> canadensis</i>) <i>Botrichium dissectum,</i>
particularly forma <i>obliquum</i> is very common though inconspicous. <i>Dryopteris</i>
<i>spinulosa, Viola</i> sp <i>Hepatica
americana</i>, Indian Cucumber Root, <i>Prenanthes </i>sp <i>Senecio obovatus, Aster divaricatus,
Lobelia inflata Geranium maculatum, Carex platyphylla, Lycopodium flabelliform</i>[spel],
<i>Conopholis americana</i>, 4-leaved Yam, a little <i>Veronica officianallis</i>[spel],
Jack in the Pulpit Spotted Wintergreen, <i>Carex</i>
sp, <i>Polygonum sagittatum, P cristatum, P.</i> sp, <i>Aster prenanthoides </i>occurs along the
stream. In one place, along the road both <i>Impatiens pallida</i> and I<i>
biflora</i> (<i>capensis</i>) occur together, the first such occurrence seen
by me. In this occurrence <i>I pallida</i> dominates, is more abundant and
larger <i> Smilax </i>sp are common and
there are some saplings of Sycamore. Although the Hemlock in the vicinity of
the road and quite generally in the area is severely defoliated, abruptly on
the far (right) bank of the stream there are a number of trees that show
little defoliation. Also on our drive back to higher elevations I noted that
most Hemlock in the oak forested upland seemed quite healthy looking.
<p> After surveying the flood plain at
2600 ft asl we ascented the stream toward 
the Fork. This reach is much as below with scattered Tuliptrees. We saw
a common (?) bright black and yellow Millipede of a familiar type. We also saw
a Red Eft and heard much calling of Pileated Woodpeckers. Mountain Laurel and
Black Gum were noted. Hemlock, greatly defoliated, some very large, still
dominates, and Black Birch increases. We saw scattered Catawba Rhododendron
bushes but only a few. A single Gypsy Moth egg mass was seen. There are fish in
the stream.
<p> At the Fork we saw perhaps the last
Tuliptrees, here at ~2800 ft asl, also Sassafras seedlings, Red, Sugar and
Striped Maple, Cucumber Magnolia, White Basswood, <i>Sambucus canadensis</i> ?,
L<i>aportea canadensis</i>, More yellow Birch 
<i>Botrychium dissectum</i> forma <i>obliquum</i>, Along the Right
Prong, climbing above 3000 ft asl we note Shagbark, Beech, much Black Birch,
increasing Yellow Birch, Large Northern Red Oak, finally the first White Oak.
Some very large Black Birch mostly Sugar but also some Red Maple, defoliated
Hemlock. Water Striders in stream. Witchhazel is very abundant, in fact the
dominant shrub. I note fire sign (basal scars) on large hardwoods. <i>Lycopodium
lucidulum</i> is quite common. I hear what sounds like a single Spring peeper
in the stream and the calls of Katydids! I also saw <i>Hepatica americana</i>.
Farther up, approaching perhaps 3200' asl ground vegetation becomes very scarce
except for a little Partridgeberry. Later Steve told me that he saw large (
~9") trout in pools at these high elevations. We saw few if any truly
northern or high elevation plants anywhere despite the elevation.
<p>

10-1-94
Dennis Hendricks and I hiked from Signal Corps Knob Area (near confederate
Breastworks on Rt 250) SW along the crest of Shenandoah Mtn for about 3 miles
to where the FS road forked above the head of Benson Run. We started at about
3100 ft asl where the forest consists of Chestnut and Northern Red Oak with
Pignut White Pine, Red and Striped
Maple, Black Locust, Witch hazel understory.<i> Veronica officianallis</i>[spel.],
White Snakeroot are common. Along this trail just above we noted Table Mtn
Pine, Bear Oak, Mtn Laurel an aster that
resembles New England Aster Wood Betony,
a low Blueberry, Chickadees sp?, flitted through the bushes. At the first fork
in the road we noted Southern Bellflower, Four leaved Yam, Hay Scented Fern, <i>Heuchera</i>
sp, possible Flame Azalea, Red Oak seedlings were abundant along the road here
at about 3200 ft asl. Proceding[spel.] along the road we entered a steep cove
zone or topographic concavity. Here we saw <i>Aster divaricatus</i>, Goldenrod
sp(?), Possible American Basswood, at any rate, large beautiful multitrunked
Basswoods, Sugar Maple, Black Birch. On the road surface we encountered an
unknown clover, also <i>Melampyrum lineare</i> and Black Huckleberry on the
bank. After passing the cove area Chestnut Oak increases again and farther up
we encounter <i>Ilex montana</i>, here at perhaps 3400' asl. Also occurring is
Hophornbeam, possible <i>Aster macrophyllus, Polygonum </i>sp and in the road <i>Galinsoga</i>
sp. We ate our lunch at the crest at ~3600' asl and I explored the forest which
here consists of about 90% Northern Red oak, 2% White Oak 1% Chestnut Oak, the rest White Pine, Am
Chestnut, Bear Oak Pignut, Striped Maple 
Pitch Pine Serviceberry, Black
Birch, Black Cherry, Hophornbeam. Ground cover is Dee[r]berry, low
Blueberry perhaps <i>Vaccinium</i> <i>pallidum,</i>
Nodding onion, Bottlebrush Grass, White Snakeroot. Nuthatches were seen and
there are some Gypsy Moth egg masses, but on less than 5% of trees. The north
facing slope at this elevation is rich in mosses. <i>Cladonia</i>, Teaberry, <i>Potentilla
canadensis </i>(?), Sweet Fern, <i>Menziesia pilosa</i> Mtn Laurel. The Northern Red Oaks have very
thick bark ridges (photo). <i>Veronica officinalis </i>occurs here at 3600'
asl. There are generally lots of Northern Red Oak seedlings.There is also
scattered Hawthorn. The soil seems very poor and rocky, podzolic with a
~4" mor layer on the surface. The transition from dominantly mixed oak to
dominantly Northern Red Oak forest occurs perhaps at 3500 ft or slightly higher. As to be expected
the crest forest consists of stunted contorted "orchard" type trees
many of which show fire indicator of widely spaced multiple (sprout) stems
(photo). Northern Red Oak here appears to occupy the same severe sites occupied
by Chestnut Oak at lower elevations, including very acid conditions. An
interesting point is that Katydids were heard calling all day long in these
mountains. Also occurring here is an unknown green leaved Blueberry (<i>V
myrtilloides</i>?)
<p> We then resumed our walk along the
ridge road descending slightly seeing Hoary Mtn Mint, Chokeberry Black Cherry,
White Ash, Shagbark Hickory, Hophornbeam, Sassafras saplings, Sugar Maple,
fairly large White Oak, still dominant Northern Red Oak. Along the more mesic
westward facing slope on the approach to the power line we noted much Goats beard,
some Black Cherry, Striped Maple, <i>Aralia racemosa</i>. At the power line I
took a photo each way. Following the trail we noted a small Butternut (with
excellent nuts) along the eastward facing slope, also <i>Cimicifuga
racemosa Dryopteris marginalis,</i> Wild
Liquorice[spel.], Poison Ivy, Christmas Fern, <i>Disporum lanuginosum</i> and other
mesic species. Farther on Pignut becomes very abundant and Shagbark occurs.
Hemlock is common as is Hophornbeam, White Pine 
Black Birch, Striped Maple.At one place we saw crossing the road a large
(3.5-4") Millipede with a Black body and many fine brown stripes.<i>
Laportea canadensis</i> is common, and there is some Impatiens sp. Although Red
Oak dominates there is some Sugar Maple and a little Chestnut Oak, here at
perhaps 3600 ft asl. At the crest a little above 3600 ft, the forest consists
of Northern Red Oak, Black Birch Red
Maple, Pignut, Shagbark, some very large (~2ft dbh) White Oak on a flat, Witch hazel is the
dominant understory Hay-Scented Fern, <i>Galium
triflorum, Laportea canadensis </i> <i>Galinsoga</i>
is on the road and Black Locust is common.
<p>10-2-94
Along the Crest Shenandoah Mtn Mike Jones, Dennis Hendricks and I hiked NE from
FR 173, west of Deerfield, along the crest of Shenandoah Mtn toward the head of
Benson Run. It was a cloudy day with a few drops of rain and the clouds brushed
the mountain tops. At the road on a pass elevation ~3100 ft asl the forest
consists of fairly large possibly 80 yr old, Chestnut, White and Northern Red
Oak, younger Red Maple, Pignut Black
Gum, White Pine and Hemlock (here in a very dry environment with no
characteristic ground cover of Partridge Berry etc) Understory consists of Flowering Dogwood,
Striped Maple, Black Locust, Deerberry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i> varieties) 
American Chestnut, Mtn Laurel. Ground cover is Tea Berry, Spotted
Wintergreen <i>Potentilla canadensis</i>
(?) <i>Uvularia pudica</i> (?) A little
along the trail there is Pitch Pine, Bear Oak 
Sassafras, Sweet Fern, Four-leaved Yam. Some Black Oak also occurs on
this part of the trail and there are scattered Gypsy Moth egg masses on some
Trees. Other species along this trail are Witchhazel, Service Berry sp?, large
patches of <i>Leucobryum</i> and other mosses and species of <i>Cladonia</i>.
There are scattered Black Cherries and Deerberry and low blueberries are
common. The forest is very unevenaged with some large old trees and many small
saplings as well. At one point we encountered a large flock of Wild Turkeys.
The elevation here is about 3200 ft. Following mostly a westward facing slope
near the crest White Pine, Pignut sp?,
Chestnut Oak, Northern Red Oak, Deerberry <i>Potentilla</i> become abundant.
There is also some Shagbark Hickory and species of unknown legumes. There are
scattered Hawthorn with abundant red berries. Pileated Woodpeckers called.
Dwarf Iris of some species is common from the leaves. At one point there was a
bush of <i>Lyonia ligustrina </i>and <i>Menziesia pilosa</i> is periodic. There
is also some Hairy Tree Lichen. At one place there is a rich westward-facing
gentle slope of rich Northern Red Oak with the remains of many down dead [American]
Chestnuts. The Red Oak here may be somewhat more than 100 yrs in age and some
trees are ~2 ft dbh. There is also sporadic fire evidence along the trail in the form of
burnt snags, basal scars, and widely-spaced sprouts in clumps. Black Birch and
White Ash also occur. in one place rock outcrops had <i>Asplenium platyneuron</i>
on them. <i>Polygonum cristatum </i> (Hedge Buckwheat) occur[s] in some places
and Hophornbeam is fairly common even in the dryest[spel] woods. At one point,
perhaps at about 3300 ft asl, on a westward facing slope of slight concavity.
there is a fairly large patch of <i>Rhododendron catawbiense</i> and lesser
amounts of <i>Ilex montana </i>here with young (~30 yr old ?) Hemlock, Black
Birch, Mtn Laurel, Red Maple. This is the only <i>R catawbiense</i> and <i>Ilex
montana</i> observed. Farther along Deer Berry of several varieties, with berry
color ranging from greenish white to dark pink becomes very abundant as do
several species of <i>Vaccinium</i>, one perhaps being <i>V pallidum </i>and
the other with, thin lanceolate leaves and hairy twigs possibly<i> V
myrtilloides</i> (?). Trailing Arbutus appears to be confined almost to large
scattered patches but Tea Berry with many puny red berries is everywhere.
Spotted Wintergreen was seen only near the road and at a few other locations
and no <i>Goodyera</i> was seen. Although not as common as Deer Berry Black
Huckleberry is common and appears to be concentrated in the poorest rocky
areas. Hemlock, always young, is scattered along the ridge and always with none
of the characteristic ground cover such
as Partridgeberry. There is also scattered <i>Melampyrum lineare,</i> some
still in bloom. Eventually the trail follows the narrow crest of a very rocky
ridge with Table Mtn Pine, White Pine, Black Birch, Chestnut Oak, Bear Oak, Mtn
Laurel, <i>Vaccinium pallidum</i> ? American Chestnut,Witchhazel and Teaberry.
Whorled Loosestrife was seen in one place. The trail continues to increasingly
high and dry terrain in which Chestnut Oak dominates and Red Maple, Black Gum,
Mtn Laurel and various Blueberries and Black Huckleberry are common. At one
place we flushed a flock of Ruffed Grouse. This area, perhaps between 3400 and
3500 ft asl, is increasingly dominated by Chestnut Oak, the dry rocky terrain,
apparently countering elevation. Presumably however, Northern Red Oak dominates
eventually as 3600 ft is approached. But we didn't get that far along the
trail. However we know it does at the crest above[see previous 10-1-94] Signal
Corps Knob 
<p> On the way back we saw a few Flowering
Dogwood trees at perhaps 3200 ft asl and this may be their elevational limit.
Also there appears to be a sequence of events shown by the forest as follows:
(1) An era of fires which favored Table Mtn and Pitch Pines. (2) An era of fire suppression favoring the
seeding and growth of Hemlock with only
light deer browsing. (3) An increase in deer suppressing Hemlock reproduction.
This was accompanied by a growth of hardwoods and the dying out of Pines except
White Pine which thrives more than Hemlock under both fire suppression and
heavy deer browsing.
<p> Finally we heard a Barred Owl call as
we returned although it was daylight but dimmed by clouds.
