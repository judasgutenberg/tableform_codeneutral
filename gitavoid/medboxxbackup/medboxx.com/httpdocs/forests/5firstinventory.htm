<ul>




  Steve
Krichbaum, Dennis Hendricks and I drove to the Tea Creek Campground in the
Monongahela NF for a 3 day rendezvous of Virginians for Wilderness and the
Central Appalachian Biodiversity Project. It was attended by about 20 in
excellent weather. Our first hike was up Tea Creek and the Williams River on
Saturday Oct 8. The forest in the vicinity of the Campground and along Tea
Creek has been previously described  in
the 8-25-92 notes. Here we add White Ash, Black Locust, Hawthorn sp, Staghorn
Sumac, <i>Viburnum alnifolium, Salix sericia</i>, American Chestnut, <i>Ribes</i>
sp Lady Fern,<i> Dryopteris spinulosa,</i> Wood Betony  Dutchmans Pipe, <i>Lycopodium flabelliforme,
L clavatum,</i> Hay Scented Fern, <i>Botrychium</i> <i>dissectum, Osmunda</i>
sp, Wood Betony[repeat !], <i>Carex plantaginea, Cymophyllus fraseri,</i> Avens
sp, Golden Saxifrage,<i> Cimicifuga americana</i>  (first seen by me)  <i>Thalictrum</i>
sp, <i>Senecio aureus</i>  (very abundant winter leaves) <i>, Laportea
canadensis, Mitella</i> ?  <i>Solidago</i> ? [sp. unknown], <i>Aster prenanthoides,</i> <i>Polygonum</i> <i>virginianum,
Lobelia inflata,</i> Black Raspberry, Beech Drops  (under Beech),  <i>Carex
scabrata, Fragaria virginiana, Ranunculus septentrionalis, Hydrangea
arborescens, Disporum lanuginosum, Philonotis</i> sp  (Moss)  <i> Angelica triquinata, Cladonia </i>sp,<i> Aster
divaricatus  Marchantia </i>sp, Honewort,
<i>Hypnum</i> sp
<p> We heard
and saw Red Squirrels and very small <i>Hyla</i> ? Frog  A common species here is<i> Meehania cordata,</i>
a creeping mint 


</ul>
<h3>10-8-94 Red Spruce Knob Trail</h3>
<ul>
 In the afternoon of Oct
8 we ascended Red Spruce Knob  (4703 ft asl).  The lower part of the forest,
perhaps starting at ~4200' asl (?) is 
Beech, Yellow Birch  Sugar Maple,
Black Cherry, Spruce with Striped and Mountain Maple understory, some White Ash
and Red Maple and <i>Viburnum alnifolium.  Rubus canadensis </i>?  (a thornless
Blackberry)  is very common as is <i>Aster acuminatus  </i>Spinulose Shield Fern, Shining Club Moss,
a umbelliferous plant, possibly <i>Angelica </i>sp? No Black Birch <i> Ilex montana </i>is the most common understory
but Southern Mountain Cranberry is common. Ground cover consists of <i>Bazzania
trilobata </i>(?), a variety of mosses. There is some Red Maple, Yellow Birch.
In some places an unknown monocot, apparently <i>Clintonia borealis </i>?   <i>Lycopodium
obscurum </i>and Hay Scented Fern also occur, the latter common in openings. In
one place, at the site of an old fire tower, Large toothed Aspen, a <i>Salix </i>sp
and a Northern Red Oak occur. On our return to the starting point on the road
at ~4100' asl or so noted  Partridge
Berry  Red Oak seedlings, <i>Smilax
rotundifolia, Aster prenanthoides </i>and <i>Hydrangea arborescens. </i>We saw
no Black Birch anywhere.



</ul>
<h3>10-9-94 North South Trail, Cranberry Wilderness</h3>
<ul> We
started just off the "Scenic Highway" in forest of Yellow Birch, Red
Maple, Beech, Striped and Mtn Maple, Spruce, Black Cherry, some Sugar Maple <i> Ilex montana.  Aster acuminatus</i> is common and<i>
Dryopteris spinulosa </i>and Hay Scented Fern are very abundant. Partridge
Berry occurs. In one place, at about ~4250 ft asl there is a small clump of <i>Magnolia
acuminata</i>, perhaps at its elevational limit. Shining Club Moss is common. <i>Rubus</i>
spp are also common. Ragged Fringe Orchid <i>Habenaria lacera</i> in moist
opening  As the traol climbs to 4400 ft
asl Red Spruce and Mountain Holly  (<i>Ilex montana </i>) become more common.
The forest floor is draped in mosses and liverworts, and in particular <i>Bazzania
trilobata</i> with abundant<i> Oxalis montana</i>.  Southern Mountain Cranberry, some with
berries, is scattered throughout. There are also small patches of <i>Cladonia </i>sp.
In some places <i>Rhododendron maximum </i>is abundant. There are scattered
tall Mountain Ash trees with berries and Red Maple. But <i>Ilex montana </i>is
the most common understory. In some places<i> Polypodium virginianum</i> occurs
in small patches on moss covered rocks. There are also scattered <i>Clintonia</i>
perhaps<i> borealis</i> ? and patches of<i> Maianthemum canadense</i>. Farther
on we encounter Mtn Laurel. Everywhere at this elevation  (~4400' asl)  <i>Dryopteris
spinulosa </i>and Hayscented Fern dominate among Ferns with some apparent
Cinnamon Fern Patches. We saw only one bush of <i>Viburnum alnifoium</i> along
this trail. In at least one place we noted a peculiar "shedding moss"
which if rubbed by the hand, covers the hand with light green. There is also
some <i>Lycopodium obscurum</i>  Where
there are openings in the spruce forest Beech, Yellow Birch and Red and Striped
Maple occur. We saw no Black Birch on this trail. In the case of the moss
referred to above, it probably propagates in this manner!
<p> It is
interesting that although there are many large rocks with steep sides in the
spruce forest at 4400 ft and above none contain Yew, although it is sometimes found
on such rocks at lower elevations in northern hardwood forest. Instead the rocks
in the spruce forest contain heavy growths of Ferns  (<i>Dryopteris spinulosa </i>)
and Spruce seedlings and saplings. Apparently these spruce forests are not
ideal Yew habitat. It's the soil stupid!  (8-7-98)  These are very nutrient
poor  rocks
<p> Quite
generally, at least above 3000 ft asl the leaves had mostly fallen from Birch
and other deciduous leaves were in the process of falling. However those of <i>Ilex
montana </i>in the dim light of the Spruce forest still cling mostly remaining
a pale sickly greenish yellow.

<h3>10-16-94 Paddy Lick</h3>
<ul> Steve Krichbaum, Mike Jones and I
visited the lower part of Paddy Lick on Allegheny Mtn just off State Rt 600 in
connection with the White Teas Timber Sale. It was a beautiful clear fall day.
We first went up the temporary stream just North of Paddy Lick. The forest here
is somewhat mesic consisting of Northern Red Oak, Black Oak, Black Birch, Sugar
Maple, White Oak, Black Locust, some quite large  (3 ft dbh)  White Pine, a few
Hemlock, Shagbark or Shaggy Pignut Hickories, a few Sycamore, some Beech  Musclewood, Sassafras, American Chestnut
sprouts and down wood, understory of Witchhazel, Flowering Dogwood, Mtn Laurel,
<i>Vaccinium pallidum,</i> Deerberry, Striped Maple. There are also some White
Basswood and Chestnut Oak on the slope. The stream had a small trickle over
deformed, vertically dipping shale and sandstone, Ground cover is White
Snakeroot, Clearplant[weed], <i>Dryopteris marginalis, Dryopteris spinulosa</i>,
New York Fern, Christmas Fern, Sedges, Viola sp,  Upslope Spotted Wintergreen, <i>Goodyera
pubescens</i>. Tea Berry and Trailing Arbutus occur with increasing Chestnut
Oak, <i>Cladonia, Asplenium platyneuron,</i> stunted <i>Carex platyphylla,
Smilax rotundifolia. </i>On top of the ridge there are many pines, Virginia and
Pitch mostly dead, Small White Pine, Stunted Chestnut Oak, Hawthorn  Service Berry, Large patches of a tall grass,
patches of<i> Cladonia</i> sp  <i>Leucobryum
</i>moss, Deer Berry  We thern descended
into the Paddy Lick hollow which had many large White Pine, Hemlock, White,
Black and Northern Red Oak. There is also Sycamore, Sugar also Red Maple,
Tuliptree, Blach Birch  (very abundant),  White Ash  Black Cherry, Black Locust.  Musclewood is very common and there are
patches of shrubby Hemlock  small
saplings. All the hemlock seems partially 
defoliated by an unknown agent. There is also some apparent Shagbark
Hickory  and non-shaggy Pignut.
Downstream near the road Beech is common and there is some Slippery Elm. No
Striped Maple? see end of section There are some American Chestnut sprouts and
a number of very large down Chestnut tree trunks. Mtn Laurel and Witchhazel are
the dominant understory. Ground cover consists of White Snakeroot,
Clearplant[weed], G<i>alium </i>sp. <i> Dryopteris spinulosa,</i> Christmas Fern,
Sedges, Viola sp, <i>Potentilla canadensis</i> ?, Hay Scented Fern, Wild
Liquorice[spel.], Large <i>Panicum </i>sp. In some places under Hemlock there
are large patches of <i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i> intergrown with Partridge
Berry  but in other places Partridge
Berry is absent  There is a little <i>Veronica
officinalis. </i>There is some Hog Peanut, <i>Polygonum</i> sp. Some Hemlock
show fire scars. There are large trout in large isolated holes in the stream.
Vines include Dutchmans Pipe. We noted stick nests near the trunk of a large
Pine. A Black Snake (sp?) was seen and Katydids called slowly still. There are
also grape vine  a little Virginia Creeper
The forest here is perhaps a little over a hundred years from the largest trees
although some are undoubtedly older. 
<p> Along the
road, in the main valley Black Walnut, Black Elderberry, <i>Cacalia
atriplicifolia, Aster patens</i> were noted
<p> At about
2200' asl here we noted a few Striped Maples but over most of the bottoms none,
Steve reported seeing a Scarlet Oak on the ridge and a few Black Gum. Generally
the latter seem scarce in this area as on yhe other side of Paddy Knob.
<p>10-18-94 Clayton Mill Spring Robert Hunsucker, Steve
Krichbaum and I went to Clayton Mill Spring Area again to study the biology,
mainly mosses, liverworts, lichens etc. We hiked up the main branch that leads
to the Special Interest area again. Just as we began we saw a Redtail Hawk circling.
Near the start near, the main stream, we saw Wahoo  (<i>Euonymus atropurpureus </i>)as
a small tree with abundant spectacular red fruits. In the upland forest we also
saw <i>Aplectrum hyemale</i>  (Puttyroot)  leaves and examined the roundish
corm for next year. We also saw<i> Aster undulatus</i>. We also saw a dead
Hairytailed Mole and <i>Carya tomentosa</i>. In the streambed (substrate?) we
saw <i>Thuidium delicatulum,</i> a Fern Moss. Also<i> Atrichum crispum,
Anomodon</i> sp, <i>Fissidens</i> sp, all mosses, an unknown leafy liverwort,<i>
Platygyrium repens</i>, a moss with minute gemmae  (on bark of dead Black Birch), a Thallus liverwort <i>Conocephalum conicum</i>, a beautiful shiny dark
green leaf the size of a dime intergrown with mosses on rocks in the stream.
Here in the stream also a few small clumps on rocks of <i>Cardamine
pensylvanicum,</i> the moss <i>Hypnum </i>sp on dead wood, <i>Dryopteris</i> <i>intermedia</i>.
here we also encountered two yellow tree frogs, one quite fat. We also saw <i>Brachythecium
</i>sp and the interesting Leafy Liverwort <i>Nowellia curvifolia </i>on a well
rotted tree trunk. Heard Katydid call, and saw another leafy liverwort on a dry
rock. On shore is <i>Leucobryum</i>. We then confirmed the presence of <i>Bazzania
trilobata.</i> Also <i>Lycopus unifloru</i>s and <i>Muhlenbergia schreberi </i> Near the spring headwater we also encountered
a Lichen <i>Peltigera</i> (?)  (Spelling may not be correct) [It's correct] and
in the vicinity of the lush fern growth previously described, <i>Chelone glabra</i>
somewhat browsed by deer. Hunsucker also found a cluster of the mushroom <i>Naematoloma
sublaterstrum</i>[spel??] as well as a <i>Calestoma </i>sp We then descended to
the Valley road by way of the diversion trail. There we noted a hatch of
Mayflies dancing above the road along the main stream. It had been another
beautiful day! The Basswood here appearsto be American Basswood. On 11-16-94
received following list from R. Hunsucker for specimens collected on above

<h3>10-30-94 Stony Run Jeep Trail</h3>
<ul>
 Steve Krichbaum and I
hiked up to the top of Big Levels via the Jeep Trail just east of Stony Run.
The entire route with eight switch backs is over hard, light gray Antietam
Quartzite. Soils are very rocky and quite sandy 
There are only two springs along the ~4 mile route we hiked to the top.
The weather was warm, mostly clear and pleasant 
Katydids called and ants worked the hills on top. We saw few birds, only
a Woodpecker  (Hairy ?) juncos etc.
<p> At the
start of our hike at Coal Road, elevation ~1900' asl the forest consists of
Chestnut and Scarlet Oak, Pitch Pine 
Black Gum, Sassafras, Red Maple, Black Locust, Virginia Pine, American
Chestnut sprouts, with Mountain Laurel understory. Along the trail Bracken Fern
is common and we saw clumps of <i>Deschampsia flexuosa. Aster linariifolius</i>
is quite abundant and <i>Coreopsis verticillata</i> was noted  <i>Vaccinium pallidum</i> and Trailing
Arbutus are common. Here also we began to see Bear Oak and Beetle(?) killed
Pines  After the first right turn in the
trail, we saw Service Berry (sp?) in the forest as first described. We also saw
a single bush of Wild Rose with large red "hips", probably native.
Golden Rods of unknown species are also common. After a sharp right turn Black
Oak were noted. After a sharp left turn at ~2100 ft asl, we saw the Woodpecker
 (Hairy ?) a few clumps of Spotted Wintergreen,<i> Leucobryum</i> sp, a Beetle
of unknown type on horse dung. At a left turn at ~2200 ft there is a small
drainage with water and a little farther on we noted clumps of Northern Red Oak
and some Blackberries. Here also Sweet Fern and the first of the Lycopod we saw
on the entire way up  This is <i>Lycopodium
tristachum</i>, which is at home in dry sandy soil.  This lycopod increases above this level The
forest is Chestnut Oak, Pitch Pine, with some Virginia and Table Mtn. Pines. We
also began to see the widely-spaced multiple sprout clumps interpreted as due
to strong fire history. Also patches of Haircap Moss begin to appear and a
single legume, probably Hairy Vetch  (non-native),  was noted. After a turn to
the right at ~2400 ft asl the forest becomes very scrubby and a photo was taken
of multiple sprouts. The lycopod  (same species)  continues abundant. Farther
along we also photographed a beautiful Butterfly. After a sharp right at ~2480
ft Pitch Pine with Laurel understory dominates. Lycopod is common and we saw a
common Dung Beetle near some horse manure. After a very sharp left turn we see <i>Menziesia
pilosa</i>, Hemlock seedling, Black Birch and <i>Rhododendron catawbiense-</i>one
of each! After this the Laurel becomes very lush and we see mor[spel] <i>Menziesia.</i>
We also see remains of Iris sp? So far we've seen no Teaberry but lots of
Trailing Arbutus, Bracken Fern  (the only fern)  and <i>Lycopodium tristachyum </i>along
the trail. After eating lunch and continuing we see the first Black Huckleberry
as small shrubs have been dominated by Blueberries. After a sharp right at 2650
ft asl we note more Catawba Rhododendron 
clumps of <i>Cladonia </i>and a number of large Ant hills [and ants]
with Red Thorax and Black abdomen. These Ant hills are probably so large ~6'
diameter because of high soil rock content 
We then took a sharp left at ~2840 ft asl and noted more large Ant
hills. I took a photo of Steve in front of stunted forest of Chestnut Oak at
~2900 ft. After another sharp right turn at ~2920 ft more stunted forest of  Chestnut Oak Pitch Pine, Black Gum and Mt
Laurel. Black Huckleberry is abundant here. Suddenly here Teaberry and Catawba
Rhododendron appear here. As we top out at about 3100 ft asl, there is a
Teaberry explosion and Rhododendron becomes abundant as well. As we hike along
an almost flat path now Teaberry forms a complete ground cover under the oaks
of which I took a photo. By contrast the Lycopod and Trailing Arbutus seem to
have dropped out. Farther on we note a few White Pine and Hemlock seedlings,
the latter with no sign of the Adelgid, although this is only a few hundred
vertical feet above Johns Run where Hemlock has been devastated. Here I also
heard Katydids call. I also took a photo across Johns Run.  At one place we saw-with berries-a single
bush of <i>Aronia melanocarpa</i>. Farther on took another Photo of Johns Run
showing Left Prong. A little fartther on we saw our first Fetterbush  (<i>Pieris
floribunda</i>)  which is a minor component in Laurel. <i>Rhododendron
catawbiense </i>is common with Laurel under Chestnut Oak and Black gum.
Teaberry remains  the dominant ground
cover with its abundant very large berries. There is some <i>Lycopodium tristachyum</i>
and Trailing Arbutus and also some Deer Berry. The low Blueberries  (<i>V
pallidum</i> ?) still have some berries, now desiccated but still sweet. Since
berries were somewhat glaucous  It may be<i>
V. vacillans</i> American Chestnut Sprouts are quite common as is Pitch Pine.
There are scattered White Pines and small Hemlock  (quite healthy).  Finally we
reach the spring which forms the Head of Johns Run, here terribly intruded upon
by the Jeep Trail. The Rhododendron and Laurel is quite lush here and beyond we
noted the first tree Lycopods  (<i>L obscurum</i>).  Bear Oak and Black Gum
become more common as does Trailing Arbutus. I also took a photo of the defiled
spring. At this point we heard a Raven and saw a large gray-brown Cricket
feeding on a Katydid, perhaps scavenging. On the way down we noted more <i>Deschampsia
flexuosa,</i> also a little Bluestem grass and a <i>Uvularia pudica </i>in
seed. On returning to the car I noted<i> Fragaria virginiana</i> and a bat in
flight. We saw more bats over the road as we drove home. We saw no Striped
Maple. <i>Ilex montana</i>. Sevice Berry occurs scattered throughout even on
the dryest[spel] sites.

<h3>11-6-94 Maple Flats / Ponds</h3>
<ul>
 Steve Krichbaum, Mike
Jones and I went to Maple Flats to look for Cranberries and more plants such as<i>
Helenium virginicum</i>. The weather was very warm (`80<sup>0 </sup>?) and
almost cloudless. We began our traverse just west of the large artificial pond.
We wen[t] W NW for about 700 ft to a small dry pond on the edge of a large
clearcut. Here we saw mistletoe  (<i>Phoradendron flavescens</i> ?)  on Black
Gum  (Photo of pond)   various grasses,
some tall in pond. We then followed along the NE side of the clearcut on a N NW
bearing for about 800 ft to another small but slightly larger Sinkhole
pond  On the way we saw a faded Gentian
with a cluster of very closed flowers but in seed  (photo).  We also noted that
mosses were dominated by <i>Leucobryum </i>sp. At the pond took photo and also
another photo of a large <i>Vaccinium </i>possibly <i>corymbosum</i>. We also
ate persimmons under a tree at the pond edge. We noted sphagnum extending into
the woods as well as various some tall grasses. We also saw a flock of Cedar
Waxwings. We then continued NW for about 1000 ft to another small dry pond (
photo).  Here tall grasses occur in the pond and sphagnum extends into the
woods. We then turned directly north toward two large sinkhole ponds, the first
about 2000' directly north. This pond was visible and dry but lies on private
land and we didn't visit it. Instead we turned east about 800 ft to the largest
pond full to the brim with water at about 1520 ft asl. On the way to the big
pond we encountered a small dry pond  (photo shows waterline).  On the way to
the big pond I also noted the extreme porous[spel.] of the soil where a tree
had fallen. There I noted the soil to great depth as white sand and rock and an
only inch thick mohr[mor] layer on top. At the big pond [ this is Green Pond] I
noted <i>Ilex verticillata </i>large <i>Vaccinium</i> (photo)  probably <i>corymbosum</i>  Red Maple 
abundant Smilax, <i>Viburnum nudum</i>, sedges  <i>Rubus hispidus</i>, an<i> Aronia</i>
possibly<i> floribunda</i> or <i>prunifolia</i>, with red berries, Pitch Pine,
many killed by the pine beetle, Smooth Alder, large Beaver girdled Black Gum,
also Gum with large fire scars. All this is on the south side first in our
counterclockwise circle of the pond, which is about 800 ft long (roughly).
About the center of the south side we encountered <i>Vaccinium macrocarpon,</i>
Large Cranberry on little raud[spel] shelves atthe pond edge  (photo)  where
they could benefit both from indirect northern light and shade from the hot
sun.  These Cranberries grow in Sphagnum,
which is common everywhere along the shore. The Cranberry plants here are the
most lush and vigorous I've ever seen-much more so than those on Green Pond  Although the pond is "open" water
it is choked with aquatic plants. Here also I noted a herbaceous <i>Hypericum </i>and
<i>Lyonia ligustrina.</i> Large tadpoles were in the pond. A single duck was
seen. In one place there were interesting rosettes of dark green sedge-like
leaves somewhat similar to Swamp Pink but not quite since they were narrower.
We then began our return taking the trail past the double pond which lies about
600 ft directly south of the big pond [Green Pond]. On the way I heard a Red
bellied Woodpecker. i photographed the bouldery shore of the dry east part of
the double pond. At the neck between the two parts the dry pond bottom is
higher  and here we noted an abundant
Composite a so-called "Sneezeweed"  (Sneeseplant![I've subsequently
stopped changing "weed" to "plant"])  a Helinium in
vigorous bloom. It has many of the characteristics of<i> Helenium virginicum </i>the
rare two county endemic which is said to occur in these ponds. It is likely
that this plant which has the required sparse, thin punctate leaves is <i>H</i>  <i>virginicum</i>. I took a few photos of it.
We then continued to the single pond which lies about 500 ft SE of the double
pond. This pond which we had seen almost dry before was again virtually dry but
for the deepest part. It contains numerous Pin Oaks on its shore and we noted a
fair amount of Mistletoe in a few Gum trees, On the way back to our truck I
noted a few of both Hemlock and Virginia Juniper scattered in the forest.
<p> Some of
these dry sinkhole ponds have a small plant widespread on mud flats which may
be <i>Eleocharis acicularis</i> but i didn't stop to inspect.

<h3>11-13-94 Rt, 33 to Hall Springs</h3>
<ul>
 Steve Krichbaum, Mike
Jones and I walked the Hall Springs Road (FR 85)  from U.S. 33 for perhaps 3
miles toward Hall Springs Weather was clear and warm   Our
route began at perhaps 3400 ft elevation in a moist-xeric forest of Chestnut
Oak  Northern Red Oak a few Pignut
Hickories, Considerable Black Birch, Virginia Pine, Red Maple, White Pine with
understory of Mtn. Laurel, Fetterbush, Hawthorn, Striped Maple, Bear Oak. There
are a few healthy Hemlock.There is along the road,  much Hay scented Fern, a
quite a bit<i> Dryopteris marginalis</i> and some Christmas fern. Dried up
goldenrod and asters are common  The road
then climbs to perhaps 3600 ft. On the way we noted <i>Carex platyphylla</i>
much <i>Leucobryum </i>moss, Black Locust, White Basswood, a creeping <i>Potentilla</i>,
perhaps <i>simplex</i> or <i>canadensis,</i> Table Mtn Pine and a few Tree of
Heaven  (Hell!).  As we climb the forest seems to become more mesic with more
Black Birch, some Hophornbeam, a few Black Cherries. We note that Yellow Jacket
Hornets are still active and a Yellow Butterfly was seen. We also saw a
grasshopper. At one place there are many small Hemlock saplings lined along the
uphill side of the road bank, probably a response a spring line intercept by
the road cut  (photo).  As we climb there is a marked increase in Northern Red
Oak perhaps at 3500 ft asl. we note a <i>Ribes </i>sp?  American Chestnut, Witchhazel, and <i>Ilex
Montana </i>At about a mile (?) from R 33 the road turns sharply right and the
aspect becomes northerly. High cliffs tower above. The slope here is very steep
and covered by a beautiful perhaps 70 yr old, Hemlock forest on a rough talus
slope  (photo)  There is also minor Yellow Birch as well as Black Birch-the
only Yellow Birch seen on this trip. There is <i>Veronica officinalis</i> in
the road bed-the only seen. Also <i>Dryopteris</i> <i>spinulosa</i> replaces
the <i>marginalis </i>of the oak forest. A little Clearplant[weed] remains.
Haircap moss is abundant and there is a little Hydrangea, Small Hemlock
saplings are very abundant along the road. Just beyond this Hemlock this
Hemlock grove the road swings to the left and the aspect becomes northwesterly
again. Pitch Pine also occurs The slope here is covered by Northern Red Oak,
Table Mtn Pine Mtn Laurel and the ferns are <i>Dryopteris</i> <i>marginalis</i>
again.  Hay Scented Fern is omnipresent.
In one place there is <i>Polypodium virginianum</i> on a rock and in another a
evergreen leaved <i>Heuchera </i>with smooth granular leaves of shape proper
for either <i>H pubescens </i>or <i>H alba,</i> the latter a rarer high
mountain form. Took a photo of downslope Red Oak forest which also contained White
Basswood and a lone Butternut. Here also I saw a single <i>Asplenium
platyneuron</i> plant, heard a Raven call and noted plentiful large leaved <i>Panicum</i>
grass on the road bank. The road continues to climb and the forest is dominated
by Northern Red Oak with only a small amt of Chestnut Oak. At one point there
is a bench[ topographic feature] on a mountain spur, here at about 3600' asl.
Here is a small grove of White Oak, some of 24" dbh but a little
contorted. They are confined to the flat part of the bench. The area still
dominated by Red Oak, has a little Striped Maple, Black Birch. The forest floor
is dominated by<i> Deschampsia flexuosa </i>which forms a continuous turf. On
rocks with a healthy looking lichen population-as on trees also-is<i>
Dryopteris marginalis</i>. Farther along the road we noted <i>Lobelia inflata</i>,
and at perhaps the highest point ofthe road American Basswood. There is also
much Chestnut although only sprouts. Again on a NW aspect there is a little
Hemlocks and flocks of juncos. The road then descends toward the saddle and a
spring. There is White Pine and Hemlock but dominant Northern Red Oak, also
some Table Mtn Pine  <i>Deschampsia
flexuosa</i> is common on road banks. In one place I take a photo of the talus
slope and note a tiny active Butterfly. Along the road as we descend, Chestnut
Oak becomes more abundant and in some places dominates but Northern Red Oak is
always abundant. Here we see a little White Oak again and a lone Blueberry.
Chestnut Oak continues to increase although Red Oak is dominant  There is scattered White Oak. At one place
where a vehicle rut is filled with water there are some rafts of a tiny
arthropod, probably an insect. It reminded me of the tiny biting yellow
creature we encountered at Skidmore  (see notes).  This version, which may have
been a nymph phase, was also yellowish and had a similar simple antennae. It
was at least as small, less than a millimeter in length and could hop well even
from the water surface but doesn't fly like the Skidmore version. I watched to
see if I could see any rising to the water surface from below but saw none. Later
along we again encountered White Basswood. We saw a Hairy Woodpecker and began
climbing again on a turn to the left. The roadbank was covered with<i>
Deschampsia</i> and<i> Leucobryum</i> moss. Hay scented Fern was common as
usual and soon we encountered our first Sweet Fern. Here also we saw, next to
the road, a 7 inch dbh, healthy looking American Chestnut. A little farther and
we entered another saddle. At near the end of our hike we saw <i>Botrychium
dissectum</i>, Nuthatches, and Hairy woodpeckers and heard a Pileated
Woodpecker  On our way back we saw both<i>
Lycopodium lucidulum </i>and <i>L flabelliforme</i>. We also flushed a Ruffed
Grouse on our return  I took a photo of a
White Pine slope  (NW facing)  and the N-facing Hemlock slope discussed
earlier. We also saw flocks of Chickadees. Some Black Oak and possible Scarlet
Oak were noted.
<p> The history
of the area seems as follows: 1) The primary forest was cut 2) Oaks grew up
from seeds  (no multiple sprouts)  in a frequent fire regime, 3) The Chestnut
blight and fire thinned the forest, 4) Fire suppression was instituted and
Black Birch multiplied.
<p> Some
species not noted were Hickories beyond the near Rt 33 area. No Sugar Maple,
Tea berry, Spotted Wintergreen, White Ash, Cucumber Magnolia, Black Gum, all of
which might have been expected. Is this [Spotted Wintergreen] really expected
at this elevation? Virginia Pine, here at unusually high elevation, is
scattered along the ridge. One patch of Trailing Arbutus was seen. No<i>
Goodyera </i>was seen.

<h3>12-26-94 Sharp Top Peaks of Otter</h3>
<ul> Steve K and I hiked
up "Sharp Top" from the Visitor's Center after hiking up the small
stream valley NW of the Center  Rock is
charnockite 
<p> The small
stream flows SE in a quite steep-sided valley. The area is dominated by
Tuliptree. Other trees are Northern Red Oak, Black Cherry, White Ash, White
Pine, Black Birch, Red Maple, Black Locust, Yellow Birch, patially defoliated
Hemlock. Undergrowth is dominated by Spice Bush and there's some Coral Berry.
We noted a single Black Walnut. The Yellow Birch increases greatly upstream
dominating Black Birch. There are some dead Chestnut on the ground. Christmas
Fern is common and theres some <i>Dryopteris marginalis </i> The winter evergreen leaves of <i>Senecio
aureus</i> are common along the stream. We noted "Fern Moss" and
other mosses. In one place there were beautiful Thallus Liverwort <i>Conocephalum
conicum</i>, also a few patches of Partridge Berry and Moss combinations.
Possible few clumps of <i>Deschampsia officinalis</i> is common. A creeping <i>Potentilla</i>
occurs on the banks. <i>Veronica</i> <i>officinalis</i> is common. There is
also the green, beautiful Sphagnum-like moss I saw at Blowing Springs along the
stream.[this is]<i> Climacium americanum</i> 
There is some Flowering Dogwood and a few Black, White and Chestnut Oaks
upstream on higher ground. In one place, along the stream in a seep saw what
appeared to be a Saxifrage, possibly<i> S. micranthidifolia</i>. A Pileated
Woodpecker was seen. Also the winter leaves of an Avens are common. The stream
had a strong flow and there were many adjacent seeps..
<p> The <i>Conocephalum</i>
noted above has the characteristics of its surface being comprised of polygons
and of being pleasantly aromatic  It also
is interesting that while this small valley faces  (opens)  southeast and is at
a modest  (2500' ?) elevation it has considerable Yellow Birch.
<p> After
eating lunch we began an ascent of Sharp top  (3875')  At the base with a NW
aspect the forest is quite mesic  consisting
of Chestnut and Northern Red Oak, White Pine, Red Maple, Black Birch, White
Ash  Black Oak, Shagbark  Catawba Rhododendron, Witchhazel,
Tuliptree  Spicebush, Flowering Dogwood,
Black Cherry, Mt. Laurel  A stump of a
large Northern Red Oak showed uniformly thick rings  (~1/5-1/4 ") 
indicating good growing conditions. Christmas Fern is common. The soil here
appears to be good deep gray brown forest soil without visible horizons and no
mor layer. Tuliptree becomes more abundant higher. At about 300' above the base
we see our first Striped Maple. We enter a patch of more xeric Oak Chestnut
forest and a large patch of Mt Laurel with much moss ground cover. Here also a
mor layer appears. <i>Dryopteris marginalis</i> is common. At about this level
Tuliptree drops out and in mesic areas is replaced by Basswood some of which
appears to be White and some American. The mesic stands consist of Basswood,
Black Birch  Red Maple, Northern Red Oak,
White Ash with Witchhazel understory. A little farther up where large rocks
become abundant we see the first <i>Polypodium virginianum</i> on these rocks.
Heuchera sp. als o becomes abundant. We see our first Pignut and Hophornbeam
and Northern Red Oak increased now 500' above the base. we see a Hairy
Woodpecker. The aspect here is more westerly. Now Catawba Rhododendron appears
again and<i> Polypodium virginianum </i>increases greatly on rock, under
Laurel. There is some <i>Danthonia</i> sp on the bank. Mosses are very abundant
under Laurel. There is more Black Oak, Northern Red Oak, Striped Maple and <i>Dryopteris
marginalis. Heuchera</i> is common. On dry, western aspects there is a
contorted, stunted oak forest. Northern Red Oak is dominant and Chestnut Oak
has dropped out here, I infer, at no more than 3500' asl. At one place, perhaps
300 ft below the top there is the bottom of a large talus slope of fairly
rounded clasts. Here there are numerous thin  (~ 1 inch)  multiple sprouts in
clumps of Mountain Maple  (acute buds, fuzzy buds and twigs, characteristic
bark)  appearing as if they are being repeatedly severed as by some agency such
as sliding ice? We encounter a lone Tuliptree here at ~3800' asl ! On a bench
between the two highest peaks we note a ~30" dbh White Oak, also peculiar,
only sligtly shaggy, hickory with large  (~1/2 inch)  buds  (It is not
Mockernut!)   White Ash also occurs. On
the way to the highest  (Sharp top)  peak we note more White Oak, increasingly
stunted, distorted and limbless, Northern Red Oak is dominant and Service Berry
becomes more common. No sign of Gypsy Moth was noted anywhere. On top, among
giant residual boulders there is contorted Red Oak much Witchhazel some small,
perhaps Yellow Birch, Mountain Laurel and Catawba Rhododendron are common. Noted
tiny flying insects on top possibly Mayflies? Large leaved <i>Heuchera </i>is
abundant and there is some Blackberry and a little Hydrangea. On the topmost
soil in a very exposed area is a short  (~2'),  dense shrub with gray flaking
bark. This seems to be Ninebark in a very stunted state. Smilax sp occurs. In
places there are clumps of <i>Danthonia</i> sp Under some rock overhangs there
are abundant plants, some only small seedlings, of<i> Saxifraga michauxii</i>
and Remains of Southern Bellflower. At one point, right on the trail, in soft
black soil, there was a small green plant with long linear opposite leaves and
with floral parts and seeds that resembled a Veronica, but like none I could
research. Yes ! also identified 12-22-94 as <i>Veronica scutellata </i> (same
as in Folly Mills Fen !)  In fact I haven't been able  to find any like it in my literature. The
same applies to Square-stemmed red, pith-centered plants with branches on
floral/seed parts in fours in a raceme. I just 12-29-94 identified this as
Broadleaf Meadowsweet <i> Spirea
latifolia </i> As I remember there's
little or no <i>Polypodium </i>on top. The<i> S. latifolia</i> is variety <i>latifolia</i>
<i>Usnea</i> is common on rocks on top. The day had been clear and mostly cool,
but not too cold and practically windless. It afforded some excellent distant
views of this part of the Central Appalachians, We returned home by way of the
Blue Ridge Parkway to the James River and then via RT 501  to Route 11. On the way we parked over the
highest point of the Parkway at 3891' asl with Thunder Ridge Wilderness falling
away to the Arnold Valley and all beyond House Mtn! Here the forest is-presumably-
all Northern Red Oak and with continuously visible <i>Rhododendron catawbiense</i>
as understory. But this all needs checking out in detail.
<br>3-12-95 Mills Creek Trail Mike Jones and I hiked from
Coal Road up Mills Creek Trail to the Filtration Plant  The weather was the warmest since last fall
and very pleasant. The terrain is very gently sloping toward the mountains.
Soils seem deep but increasingly rocky with depth and somewhat sandy. About 100
yards from Coal Road on the east side of the trail there is a small sinkhole
pond. This pond has a small seep inlet and is surrounded by fairly mature
trees, mostly Red Maple and Black Gum. Understory appears to be <i>Viburnum
dentatum</i>, Huckleberry and <i>Vaccinium</i> sp. The forest floor has
abundant Sphagnum, Partridge Berry,<i> Rubus hispidus</i>. There are also some
large Pitch Pines and <i>Smilax </i>sp ? is abundant. There may have been some
amphibian egg masses in the Pond  The
forest along the trail is mostly oak, with Scarlet Oak apparently dominant from
leaves on the ground. White Oak is also abundant as are Black and Chestnut Oak.
There are small groves of Big toothed Aspen and and Black Gum is common. Black
Cherry, Black Locust, Virginia Pine and Red Maple occur and Red Maple is very
abundant especially in clearcuts. <i>Viburnum</i> <i>dentatum </i>and Smooth
Alder as well as unidentified  (Huckleberry, Blueberry ?)  shrubs occur in seep
areas  Mourning Cloak and other
butterflies were seen. Several Woodcock flew up near the Pond. Farther along
the trail Tuliptree and Hickories including Mockernut are common. One small
Beech was seen. Broom Sedge is common in openings and <i>Danthonia spicata</i>
occurs widely. Chorous Frogs  were heard
in some seeps. <i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i> is common on the trail banks.
There are a few scattered Virginia Junipers and only a trace of Mountain Laurel
except along the stream where it is abundant. At the dam edge <i>Dryopteris
marginalis</i> occurs in sturdy clumps but is heavily browsed by deer (?) Here
also Black Birch is common. Mike saw a turtle in a seep below the dam. White
Pine is also fairly common. A photo was taken from the dam toward the NE. Also
one of a cut bank below the dam and one of the Pond. A small amount of Bear Oak
also occurs and <i>Potentilla canadensis</i> ? occurs on the banks. A large
hairy scat was found on the trail and a large grassy one on the dam.

<h3>3-17, 18, 19-1995 
Hemlock Overlook</h3>
<ul>
 Mike Jones, Steve Krichbaum and I participated in a
PAW [Preserve Appalachian Wilderness] conference at Hemlock Overlook Regional
Park near Clifton, Va where we also met R. Hunsucker  There we took nature hikes, 3 in part along a
trail along the Bull Run River  (Blue Trail).  Tree species noted were
Tuliptree, Red Maple   Sycamore, Northern
Red Oak, Southern Red Oak  (<i>Quercus falcata</i>)   Scarlet Oak, Black Oak, Chestnut Oak  (few), 
White Oak  Virginia Pine, White Pine, Box
Elder  (along flood plain)   Hemlock (
some Adelgid damage on large trees),  River Birch  Black Cherry, Large toothed Aspen  (abundant). Beech  (abundant)   Black Walnut  (one), American Elm  (one large),  Mockernut and Pignut  (<i>Carya glabra</i>) 
Hickories, Flowering Dogwood, American Holly, Musclewood, Red Bud, Service
Berry  (sp?)  Virginia Juniper, White Ash, Paw Paw, Persimmon. No American
Chestnut was seen  Shrubs include Mtn
Laurel  (common),  <i>Euonymus americanus,</i> Witch hazel, Spice Bush, <i>Viburnum
acerifolium, Rosa palustris</i>, Coral Berry  (little along stream),  Smooth
Alder  one bush seen [ of ] <i>Vaccinium
corymbosum, V. pallidum,</i> Azalea  (sp?),  <i>Rubus  </i> (sp ?)   (a Blackberry),  Grape Vine (
sp ?)  are common along stream.
<p> Herbs in
the dry upland forest are Spotted Wintergreen, Partridge Berry  (moister acid
sites)   Trailing Arbutus  (not common)  <i> Saxifraga virginiensis,</i> Ebony Spleenwort<i>,
Danthonia spicata  Houstonia cerulia</i>[spel]  Herbs of moister areas and the flood plain
are Cranefly Orchid, very abundant Trout Lily, Blue Bells,<i> Clatonia
virginica, Lycopodium flabelliforme, Potentilla canadensis</i> (?), <i>Aster
divaricatus, Solidago</i> spp, Broom Sedge, Yellow Foxglove  (sp?), <i>Elephatopus
carolinensis, Corydalis flavula</i> and <i>Cardamine hirsuta </i>are very
common. Other herbs are Coral Orchid, Christmas Fern  (abundant)   Shining Clubmoss  (rare),  a<i> Luzula</i>
sp.  (blooming)   a clump of <i>Hepatica
americana </i> (in bloom), <i> Bromus purgans</i>, a few Common Polypody ferns
on rocks, Beech Drops, a clump of <i>Dryopteris intermedia  Lysimachia ciliata, Aruncus dioicus,</i> <i>Ranunculus
abortivus </i> Mosses, mostly on steep
banks include cushions of <i>Leucobryum</i> sp in dry forest on steep
banks  <i>Aulocomnium heterostichum </i>(
with crinkled leaves)   <i>Dicranella</i>
sp, <i>Thuidium delicatulum  Cirophyllum
boscii</i>, <i>Mnium </i>sp, <i>Dicranum</i> sp  (Windswept moss).  In places
there are rich patches of Common Haircap moss  (sp?).  Liverworts appear to be
more common on damp areas and rocks near the river. Here <i>Conocephalum
conicum </i>was noted. Kingfishers, Malard[spel] and Wood Ducks and Canadian
Geese. A beautiful pair of Wood Ducks were[was] seen. We also saw 2 fairly
large Turtles basking on a tree trunk. A turned over down trunk exposed a Red
backed Salamander and at one upland forest location we saw a male Box Turtle.
<p> The exposed
rock everywhere along the river appears to be phyllite. Large masses of Vein
quartz were seen on the uplands. The soils on slopes above the river deep, dark
colluvial soil occurs.

<h3>3-31-95 Pasture Fence Mtn, Property of Frank Fishbourn
<i>et al</i></h3>
<ul> 
Ernie Reed, Frank Fishbourn and I visited the 453 acre Fishbourn
family tract on the  W. slightly NW slope
and summit of the Mtn. The property extends down to the Moormans River and
virtually borders Shenandoah National Park 
46 acres consists of reverting to pasture with many Hawthorn Trees as
well as brambles and acid soils covered by Hawkweed  <i>Potentilla </i>etc. This is the summit
area at ~2800' asl  The rest is beautiful
mesic forest on the steep west slope down to the Moormans River. The forest is
uneven age with some large old  (~100 yrs)  Northern Red Oak, Tuliptree and
White Pines. The weather was partly cloudy and quite cold. Species present in
the slope forest, as determined along the jeep road down to the river are
Tuliptree, Black Locust  Red Maple, White
Ash, Hackberry  (small),  Black Birch, White Pine, Northern Red Oak, Sycamore,
Flowering Dogwood, Black Gum, Hophornbeam, Basswood, Chestnut Oak, Shagbark
Hickory. Beech were noted at lower elevations near the stream. Spice Bush is
very common and grape vines were noted. On topographic convexities at lower
elevation Mtn Laurel is abundant  Much <i>Dentaria
laciniata</i> was in bloom. Garlic Mustard is very abundant on the downslope of
the jeep road. Christmas Fern and <i>Asplenium platyneuron </i>are common  <i>Stellaraia pubera</i> was in bloom and
Common Chickweed is abundant. In one place <i>Corydalis flavula</i> was in
bloom. <i>Carex plantaginea</i> (?) was noted. On our way back along the
Moormans River in Shenandoah NP much defoliation of Hemlock by the Adelgid was
noted.
</ul>
<p>


<h3>4-2-95 Flat Top Peaks of Otter</h3>
<ul> Mike Jones and I hiked
to the top of Flattop peak  (elevation 4001 ft)  in quite cold weather  The first ~1/3 mile of the trail is gently
rolling with many large, ice-storm-damaged Tuliptrees. Some Black Oak, Pignut
and Mockernut Hickories, Black Cherry, Black Locust  (particularly in clearings), Flowering Dogwood, much Spicebush, large Poison Ivy vines on trees. ~2400'
asl   Farther on Red Maple, Hophornbeam,
White Basswood and Northern Red Oak appear. Black Berries are common in
openings. Among herbs Sweet Cicely  (sp?) is most common but just beginning to
come up. Garlic Mustard is common along the trail, Bloodroot, <i>Stellaria
pubera, S media, Corydalis flavula, Dentaria laciniata  Viola rotundifolia</i> (?), other yellow and
blue violets, all in bloom  (<i>V</i>. <i>rotundifolia </i>identified by flower
characteristics).  Also a few Mayapple,<i> Galium</i> <i>triflorum </i>(?), <i>Geum</i>
sp, <i>Aster divaricatus</i> plants were noted. Last yr's 4-leaved Yam seed
capsules were see, <i>Dryopteris marginalisis</i> common and Christmas Fern was
noted. A Ribes perhaps <i>R. rotundifolia</i> was fairly common. Striped Maple
also occurs. Where the trail begins its ascent there is more Pignut and
Chestnut Oak appears. Here we counted more than 150 rings on a large sawed,
downed Black Oak. Very slow growth is indicated. White Ash, Black Birch, White
Pine and Adelgid infected Hemlock were noted. About 200 ft elevation above the
start Tuliptree drops out. Shagbark Hickory appears and Basswood appears to
replace Tuliptree. A little above this we enter a more xeric and acidic slope
with nut Oak  Mt Laurel, <i>Leucobryum  Goodyera pubescens</i>.  Then again enter a concavity with much
Mountain Maple in coarse talus. American Chestnut sprouts also occur nearby.
About 300 ft above the road trees are more deformed and possible Dutchman's
Pipe Vine was noted. Fern moss is very common in moist areas. Here we also
noted a dead Land Snail and an old down Am. Chestnut. <i>Ribes</i> sp is common
and possible White Basswood identified. A Pileated Woodpecker was heard. Nearby
large Northern Red Oak with basal deformities and scars, possibly denoting fire
in the remote past were noted. Here we also identified Red Elderberry  (brown
pith)  putting out its first leaves at about 500 ft above the road  (~3000 ft
asl (?)).  We then entered an area of heavy Mt Laurel, Chestnut Oak, <i>Leucobryum</i>
and other mosses, <i>Cladonia</i> and other lichens, mor forest floor. Just
above we encountered our first Yellow Birch 
a Blueberry bush with large flower buds, <i>Polypodium virginianum </i>on
rock. At this point and somewhat lower we noted few wildflowers yet emerged. In
some places Black Locust is abundant. <i>Dryopteris marginalis</i> is and has
been common all the way up. At this point we noted large Yellow Birch and some
Mtn Maple, also <i>Heuchera</i> sp?  At
about 3500' asl noted ice in springs 
Black Birch is is common with some Yellow Birch. Red and Black Oak are
common and Chestnut Oak drops out-as is usual. We now note our first Witchhazel.
There are many large brown and black Rock Tripe lichens on the rocks. At this
point we encounter our first <i>Dryopteris intermedia</i> shield fern and a
little above a line of newly sprouting Ramps on the trail edge at perhaps 3700'
asl. Here on a northern aspect Northern Red Oak, White(?) Basswood, Yellow
Birch, Black Birch  Hophornbeam, Striped
Maple occur and a springy spot contained apparent Caddis larvae tubes. Above
this we encountered our first <i>Saxifraga michauxii </i>putting out new light
green leaves in rosttes.<i> Polpodium virginianum </i>is common on rocks with
with[repeat] this saxifrage, mosses and lichens and Striped Maple is very
abundant. Now huge boulders, the result of differential weathering appear. We
see our first <i>Rhododendron catawbiense </i> Hemlock appears healthy. Above on the first
gentle slope among large rocks patch of 6 inch high Haircap Moss occur. A
little beyond this we saw two piles of carnivore scat 3/4" in diameter
4.4" long consisting of white bleached hair, bones etc. On the very top
the forest consists of stunted, contorted Northern Red Oak, Large multi-stemmed
clumps of Witchhazel, small Yellow Birch, Red Maple,<i> Rhododendron
catawebiense</i>, Black Berries, <i>Smilax</i> sp, Choke Cherry, Hazelnut
sp?  Black Cherry and among the very most
exposed rocks at the highest point <i> Spiraea latifolia</i>. The huge rocks are
covered with the usual large brown lichens as well as<i> Usnea. Michaux's
Saxifrage</i> is common as are clumps of grass  (sp?)  and sedge, the latter in
bloom. In one place in a hole under rock Mike spotted a rodent, brown in color
and possibly a Woodrat. Other plants are<i> Dryopteris</i> <i>intermedia</i>
and possibly <i>Dicentra exima</i>. Land snails also occur as evidenced by
their shells. In one place some fairly large Yellow Birch, contorted and lichen
covered stood next to and in the shelter of the huge rocks. Summit Northern Red
Oak identified by large acorns  Here also
there was an ancient standing fragment of charred tree trunks indicating some
fire in the past. We saw Vultures, Ravens and on the way down a Hairy
Woodpecker. Patches of Haircap Moss are also common between the summit trunks.
On the summit and in other places there was sign of many deciduous ferns, possibly
Hay Scented. The soil in most places seemed of good texture and color, in the
mesic forest brown mull type and on the summit black with organic matter. We
saw no sure White Oak except a few leaves on the summit.

<h3>4-9-95 Coles Run</h3>
<ul>Steve Krichbaum and I hiked up Coles
Run in the Big Levels area in very warm weather to the point that I got ill
from struggling through the Laurel 
thickets. At the start, along Coal Road trees include Chestnut, Black
Gum  Pitch Pine, Tuliptree, Sassafras (
in bloom),  Red Maple, Virginia Pine, Flowering Dogwood  (not yet in bloom),  a
few small Virginia Juniper. Mt Laurel is the most abundant undergrowth  Herbs noted were<i> Hexastylis virginicum, </i>Spotted
Wintergreen <i> Viola hastata</i>  (in
bloom),  <i>Viola</i> sp, <i>Aster divaricatus</i>, a patch of Partridge Berry
on the stream bank with moss.<i> Thuidium </i>sp, <i>Leucobryum</i> sp, <i>Danthonia
spicata</i>, Trailing Arbutus  (in bloom)  
<i>Antennaria plantaginifolia</i>  (in bloom),  Lower shrubs include
Azalea sp?, Low Blueberry. Service Berry sp? is blooming everywhere. Near the
road we saw and heard rather plain warblers 
<i>Smilax </i>sp also is common. A little farther on we encountered <i>Rhododendron
catawbiense</i>. Along the road / trail <i>Potentilla canadensis, Fragaria
virginica, Zizia aptera</i>  (or <i>Thaspium trifoliatum</i>)   We also encountered what is almost certainly
Mockernut Hickory along the trail. Black Oak was also noted. At this point we
reached the reservoir. This reservoir seems quite biologically sterile with
clear water and little sign of vegetation or animal life. We did note one
Canadian Goose and a fisherman pull out a fish 
possibly a trout. On the upper end of the reservoir the character of the
regional rock  (Antietam Quartzite)  and soil is very apparent  The soil is very sandy  (quite white)  and
rocky. At this point we saw what appeared to be<i> Dicentra exima</i>. There
were also Blackberry canes. Here I took a photo across the reservoir  (Photo #1).  Here we also saw the first <i>Sphagnum </i>sp. and Black Birch. Steve
noted some Crayfish shells near the stream. Tuliptree and Pignut are common and
Mtn Laurel forms thickets in the valley flat along and out from the stream  which is quite incised. <i>Rhododendron
catawbiense</i> is more confined to the vicinity of the stream. Pitch and White
Pine are common and increasingly upstream, Table Mtn Pine. There are some large
Black Gum and Teaberry is common under the Laurel. Here, perhaps 1/4 mile
upstream from the reservoir, we saw a large frog in the stream, probably a Wood
frog. White and Pitch Pine and Sphagnum are conspicuous and there are patches
of Partridge Berry. I also noted 5 ft shrubs appearing to be heaths with dry
numerous flower heads on long stalks  (Azalea ?). It didn't appear to be <i>Lyonia</i>.
Here I also noted Spotted Wintergreen,<i> Goodyera pubescens</i> and on a rock <i>Polypodium
virginianum.</i> Flowering Dogwood is common. Talus slopes on the Valley edge
do not appear very mobile and are covered richly with lichens. <i>Leucobryum</i>
sp become very common at the base of trees. At one place along the stream, in
heavy laurel on a down trunk ~3 ft above the ground, I saw remains, many small
feathers, of a fairly large bird kill, probably by a raptor. Tall blooming
Serviceberry is scattered in the uplands and valley edge. The upland forest here
appears dominated by Chestnut and Black Oak and saw Black Gum. Basal fire scars
are common. There are a few Am. Chestnut sprouts. To this point, perhaps a half
mile above the reservoir there have been few seeps but here we encountered the
first. Trees surrounding the seep are White and Pitch Pine, Tuliptree, Black
Gum, some White Oak, Flowering Dogwood, Sassafras. Sedges (sp?) surround the
seeps and there are clumps of Sphagnum and Partridgeberry  Among the latter are inconspicuous rosettes (
winter)  of Swamp Pink. The Swamp Pink was just beginning new growth in the
center of the rosettes  <i>Thuidium</i>
is common on tree bases. A Turkey Vulture flew overhead. We then began our
return through the upland woods which appears to be dominated by Chestnut,
Black and some White Oak  Pignut  (sp?),
Red Maple with no Mtn Laurel understory  At one place I saw a large tree with what
appeared to be debarking with scratches on the wood, the debarked area perhaps
6-8 inches in diameter-apparently a "Bear Tree"  (photos # 2 and 3) 
Here also more<i> Viola hastata</i> in bloom and much "Velvet" Moss (<i>
Dicranum</i> sp?) like that on Muellers Mtn. At the lower end of the reservoir
near the dam I noted<i> Asplenium platyneuron</i>. Below the dam we saw a Fence
Lizard on a six inch Tuliptree sapling.  (photo # 5 and 6).  Photo #4 was taken
of iron oxide discharge staining a branch of the stream red here.
<br> This valley
is different in character from some others, such as Kennedy Creek which is rich
in seeps and hydric vegetation of diverse shrubs. By contrast the Coles Run
Valley, at least the part seen by us, is quite dry with few seeps and
apparently by a simpler vegetation, although in places we saw signs of large  (<i>Osmunda</i>
sp)  Ferns from last year. It may be that water draining from the mountains
into the Valley doesn't reach the surface because of the porosity of the White
sand and cobble etc. As a previously 
stated the stream is mostly quite deeply incised (~8 ft).  Despite the
warm weather we saw few insects except few scattered Spring Azures (?)
butterflies. I believe that the sterile nature of the  almost pure white sand subsoil and quartz
rock militates against and[?] richness in either flora or fauna. I did see a
few Water Striders mating in the stream. The mountainside above the
reservoir has many dead pines, perhaps due to the recent activity of the
Southern Pine Beetle. The age of the forest here appears to be modest with few
trees more than 15 inches dbh. However this may in part be due to inferior
growing conditions due to the sterile soil. Yet the form factors of the trees
seem good at least in the valley flats and benches, perhaps due to adequate
moisture compensating for low nutrients. It is possible that in the past fire
set an upper limit on age. We saw no sign of the Gypsy Moth.
<br>4-16-95 "Gap" Timber Sale, Smith Creek
Watershed Steve Krichbaum, Mike Jones and I went to see the Proposed
"Gap" Timber Sale and the Smith Creek Watershed. Elevation ~1600'
asl   We approached on Rt 606 from the NW
over Warm Springs Mtn. We started along a reach of Smith Creek in McGraw Gap
just below Pin[e]y Branch  The bed of the
stream is comprised of huge boulders and the mountainside steep and rocky.
However there is some good colluvial soil here in the gorge. Trees noted are
Adelgid infested Hemlock, Tuliptree, Black Locust, Black Birch, Northern Red
Oak, Scarlet Oak, Chestnut Oak, White Oak, White(?) Basswood, Cucumber Magnolia,
Red Maple, White Ash, Black Gum, Sycamore, White Pine, Black Oak, Flowering
Dogwood, <i>Amelanchier</i> <i>arborea</i> (?) One small Striped Maple. Shrubs
are <i>Rhododendron maximum</i>, Mtn Laurel, Smooth Alder, Witchhazel, <i>Rubus
occvidentalis</i>  Hydrangea. In the
stream bed there occurs what appears to be a spiraea. However it doesn't appear
to be the rare Virginis Spiraea which occurs in such habitat. Herbs include <i>Dryopteris
marginalis</i>, Christmas Fern, <i>Polypodium virginianum  Carex</i> <i>plantagginea</i>  (in bloom),  <i>C.
torta</i>  (in bloom)  in stream bed, <i>Carex</i> spp, <i>Geranium maculatum </i>(
in bloom),  Large flowered Trillium  (with light pink flowers),  Golden Ragwort
 (in bloom),  <i>Aster divaricatus, Asarum canadense</i>  (in bloom),  Blood
Root, Jewel Plant[weed] sp., <i>Dentaria laciniata</i>  (in bloom),  Trout
Lily, <i>Stellaria pubera</i>  (in bloom),  Black Cohosh sp[ there is only one
species of Cimicifuga, <i>C. racemosa,</i> referred to as "Black
Cohosh", while the other species, <i>C. americana</i>, is referred to as
"Mountain Bugbane."], a white violet in stream bed,<i> Dicentra exima</i>,
Jack-in-the-Pulpit,<i> Uvularia </i>sp 
Rue Anemone, <i>Clintonia</i> (?) sp.-and the same small hairy
mystery  plant as on Muellers Mtn!. Its <i>Cerastrum
viscosum </i>dope!  Swallowtail
Butterflies (yellow),  a small elegant Sphinx Moth and Gnats were seen as was a
Woodchuck
<br>Photo #1 of Smith Creek, Photo #2 <i>Carex plantaginea</i>  Photo #3 <i>Carex torta</i>, Photo #4 of
"Spiraea" 
<p> We then
went up the slope of Warm Springs Mtn to the sites of the cutting units (
proposed)  the first being at the junction of RT 606 and Forest Road 125.We
entered the units, seeing the pollowing trees: Scarlet, Black and Chestnut Oak,
Sassafras, Black Gum  Red Maple,
Flowering Dogwood, Serviceberry, Pitch Pine, scattered Hemlock  (little Adelgid), a few fair sized Striped Maples, downhill increasing White Oak, a few Pignut
sp  a few American Chestnut Sprouts.
Shrubs include Mt Laurel, Deer Berry (?), low Blueberry  (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>?),  Black Huckleberry (?). Some trees have large grape vines. There is a heavy
leaf mat but Viola hastata  (in bloom)  is quite common sprouting through this.
Other herbs include <i>Leucobryum </i>sp, <i>Thuidium </i>sp  (in moister areas), "Velvet" moss  Tea
Berry  <i>Goodyera pubescens </i>and very
few Spotted Wintergreen. Basal fire scars, some well healed are common, usually
on the uphill side, as if fire burned up hill from the NE down the valley.
There are also scattered patches of <i>Cladonia</i> sp and a few clumps of <i>Danthonia
spicata</i> and a few clumps of bright green sedge  (not in flower yet). 
Toward a small watercourse Tuliptree and Black Birch appears and Northern Red
Oak were noted, although the latter may be present higher as well. In some
places here Black Locust is abundant but scrubby. At one place a few stunted <i>Geranium
maculatum</i> were seen. <i>Angelica venenosa </i>is common but scattered, and
there are Blue Violets as well. In one place there is a patch of Partridge
Berry in moss. There are also a few plants of <i>Galium triflorum </i>(?). At a
small seep Blue Violet, sedges and a rush occur. A Turkey Vulture circled
overhead. We then turned to FR 125 and walked NE along it to the next cutting
unit on its NW side, Mike and  I then
went downhill again to an artificial pond visible through the trees. Along the
road we had noted a Bigtoothed Aspen, Witchhazel and along a small water course
Trailing Arbutus  (in bloom), <i> Galax</i>, the latter the farthest north I'd
ever seen and Teaberry. We also noted Plantain-leaved Pussytoes along the road
and a soil profile with mor and bleached layer below that. Down the hill we
noted <i>Hieracium venosum</i>, sprouting Iris sp. At the pond I heard the
years first Vireo. Salamanders, possibly Newts, were in the Pond. <i>Lycopodium
flabelliforme</i> occurred on the pond edge. 
Down slope from the pond in a seep, turned rocks revealed a possible
Dusky Salamander (?) and a Two lined Salamander (?). On our way back uphill
we  noted more Galax near watercourses
and on banks, a newly sprouting mint? possibly <i>Monarda </i>sp. by its odor.
Also we encountered a single multiple trunked Sugar/Black Maple that had been
severely attacked by Sapsuckers and hence was blackened by fungi stain. It
should be noted that the degree of attack of Hemlock by Adelgid increased
downhill from FR 125. Also we saw no sign of Gypsy Moths.
<br>"Gap" Timber Sale/Smith Creek Watershed +
left prong Wilson Creek along FR 125  On
our way home we drove NE on Forest Road 125 in the deep Valley of Smith Creek.
The forest seems quite xeric and oak-rich even in the Valley although <i>Rhododendron
maximum</i> is common in moister areas 
Toward the divide with Wilson Creek, Hemlock seems less infected with
the Adelgid but along Wilson Creek infection increases again. At the place
where the old road crossed Wilson Creek and there is much sign of camping the
Hemlock is mostly dead or dying. Partridge Berry is common here and <i>Hepatica
americana</i> was noted. There [I] also detected the odor  (pleasant)  of what
was probably <i>Amelanchier arborea</i> flowers. Most of the route along Wilson
Creek is marked by old and not-so-old timber cuts, with many clearcuts, some
extending up the mountainsides. Some of these clearcuts are virtual
monocultures of Tuliptree, while some have abundant Red Maple.
<p> The forest
along Smith Creek, at least where we stopped and botanized, seems of the class
of "acid mesic" for lack of a better term, as indicated by Hemlock,
Rhododendron and lack of Sugar Maple. No Spice Bush was seen although, as at
this place, the ground flora may be quite rich as illustrated by Trillium,<i>
Dentaria </i>etc.

<h3>4-22-95 Green Ridge State Forest, Md.</h3>
<ul> Steve Krichbaum
and I drove to Green Ridge State Forest to meet with Charlie Sullivan and
others on a rendezvous arranged by Charlie. We were at first frustrated in an
attempting to reach State Forest HQ coming from the south when we
encountered  fords on 15 Mile Creek. We took
several photos of the Potomac River from overhanging bluffs along the road. By
going around we finally reached the HQ near I-68. We then hiked down to the
Swinging Bridge on 15 Mile Creek.
<p> The upland
forest everywhere is an apparently monotonous oak forest apparently dominated
by Black, Scarlet  White and Chestnut
Oaks with much Red Maple in places. Other abundant trees are Black Gum, Black
Locust, Black Cherry  Virginia and White
Pines with some Hemlock, Tuliptree, Pignut 
Mockernut, Service Berry, Flowering Dogwood. There are of course minor
areas along the stream and in depressions that have more diverse forests as we
shall see. However the area seems lightly populated and the forest relatively
unfragmented but for roads. Soils appear deep but rocky and acid for the most
part. Many areas seem devoid of undergrowth such as Mt Laurel or
Rhododendron  We saw no Yellow Birch and
little Beech and Sugar Maple where we passed.
<p> On the hike
down to 15 Mile Creek we noted Black Oak 
Scarlet Oak, White Oak and Chestnut Oak in order of abundance with
Virginia Pine and some White Pine as well as Pignut, Black Gum  Black Locust, Red Maple, Black Cherry,
Sassafras. Red Bud seems abundant everywhere and was in full bloom, as was
abundant Service Berry.<i> Rhus aromatica</i> occurs just below I-68 There is
also some Mockernut, Big toothed Aspen and in richer mesic slopes White Ash,
Blackhaw Viburnum  Sugar Maple, Flowering
Dogwood. Photo #3 is SW from just below I-68. Also <i>Hypericum hypericoides</i> 
+ Haircap moss Shrubs in this upland forest are almost confined to scattered
low blueberries and perhaps 
huckleberries with a small amount of Mt Laurel  Herbs noted include Spring Beauty  (<i>Claytonia
virginica </i>) blooming in abundance in the heavy leaf mat  <i>Veronica officinalis</i>, Teaberry,  Virginia Saxifrage, <i>Antennaria plantaginifolia</i>, Rue Anemone, <i>Cladonia  Potentilla canadensis</i>,
abundant <i>Dentaria laciniata </i>in places 
Garlic Mustard, mostly along the trail, Common Chickweed, <i>Geum </i>sp,
<i>Uvularia pudica</i> (?) and <i>Galium aparine</i>  Common Violet (?), patches of <i>Smilax</i>
sp and in richer soil areas patches of Japanese Honeysuckle. At some small
cliffs of rock outcrops <i>Polypodium virginianum</i> and Rock Tripe occur. No
Spotted Wintergreen or Hawthorn observed  
Small amounts of Teaberry and<i> Hieracium venosum </i>occur and <i>Leucobryum</i> sp and other mosses are common around tree trunks. Near a largepatch of <i>Dentaria
laciniata </i>we noted a White Butterfly, perhaps a "West Virginia
White" (<i> Pieris virginiensis</i>)  known to feed on <i>Dentaria</i>. We
also saw a brilliant Scarlet Tanager sitting on a small tree but didn't hear a
Tanager call all day. There were also a few Golden Ragwort blooming on the
trail. The traverse began at ~960' elevation at State Forest HQ and ended at
Swinging Bridge of 15 Mile Creek at ~700' elevation[.]  In the evening Steve Parks and his wife Julie
and I drove up along Sugar Bottom Road and camped in the edge of a recent shelterwood
timber cut. It was cold and windy. During the night we heard Whipoorwills[spel.]
and Barred Owls. Elevation ~1000' asl
</ul>
<p>



<h3>4-23-95</h3>
<ul> We awoke to the calls of a number of birds
including Crows, Ravens, Robins, drumming woodpeckers and saw a Pileated
Woodpecker. The forest here is dry upland and dominated by White, Black and
Scarlet Oak with some Chestnut Oak There are smaller Pignuts and even some
Mockernuts. Redbud and Service Berry are common and Flowering Dogwood occurs.
There are also small scattered Black Cherry. Virginia Pine is common in small
stands. Shrubs are mostly low Blueberry 
perhaps<i> V. pallidum. Leucobryum</i> sp is very common. Herbs include <i>Pedicularis
canadensis</i>, Virginia Spring Beauty, <i>Potentilla canadensis</i> ?  <i>Galium triflorum, Deschampsia flexuosa</i>
(?)  Some of the large felled oaks were
quite old, by count at least 130 years, with some possibly older.
</ul>
<p>



<h3>4-24-95</h3>
<ul> 
The next day we did a survey along 15 Mile
Creek beginning at Swinging Bridge here at ~700' elevation. The forest here is
dominated by Hemlock  (no Adelgid ?),  Black Gum, Red Maple, Sycamore, Northern
Red Oak. Spice Bush is a common shrub. Ground cover is dominated by Trout Lily
 (in bloom).  <i>Panax trifolius</i> is the most abundant I ever saw with
thousands of plants on the flood plain. Other herbs in the vicinity of the
Bridge are <i>Pedicularis canadensis, Potentilla canadensis </i>?,  (in bloom), <i> Houstonia cerulea[</i>spel?]  (in bloom),  <i>Aster divaricatus, Uvularia
sessilifolia,</i> Sedges. Here I heard Toads singing and someone saw a turtle
in the stream. A little later Julie spotted two Wood Turtles mating in a clear
pool in the stream. Mating occurred plastron to plastron underwater with (
apparently)  the male on top. They were observed for an hour and 3 minutes from
11:22 AM although they were unobserved for a longer[total] period. During the
period of observation the male (?) took in air 3 times but the female (?) not
at all  (transfer of air through sex organs ?). The weather was cool and partly
cloudy.
<p> There is
much sign of Beavers along this stream and a little way downstream from the
Bridge is a Beaver pond. I also heard a Red Shouldered Hawk call. Trees noted
downstream include <i>Tilia americana</i> (?), Shagbark Hickory, Sugar Maple (
mostly on N-facing slope)   White
Basswood (?)  Tuliptree, Black Birch  (on
slope)  White Oak  Musclewood. Tuliptree
becomes more abundant downstream  Shrubs
in the flood plain include Ninebark, an unknown dogwood, Spicebush, <i>Alnus
serrulata</i>  Herbs include <i>Circium </i>sp,
Christmas Fern, Sedum <i>ternatum 
Dryopteris marginalis, D. intermedia, Carex platyphylla, Hepatica</i> <i>americana,
Thuidium</i> sp on slope,<i> Monarda</i> sp ?, <i>Polygonatum biflorum,</i>
Walking Fern on reddish sandstone on edge of flood plain  [*Note <i>Corydalis aurea</i> may be present
on the bank facing north]  <i>Maianthemun
canadense,</i> Blue Cohosh, <i>Dicentra cucullaria, Dentaria laciniata,
Prenanthes</i> sp, <i>Goodyera pubescens, Viola rostrata,</i> Star Flower (?),
Teaberry, <i>Dentaria heterophylla,</i> Plume Lily sp ? Going up Wellesley
Hollow, a branch stream we noted Star Flower  (definite), <i> Viola pubescens</i>,
on main stream again<i> Carex torta.</i> Possible warblers were heard aswas a
Phoebe. Large fish  (Trout ?) were seen in the stream and lots of insects
nymphs etc  (mayflies  stoneflies etc) 
were found under rocks in the stream. In one pool large strings of Toad eggs
were seen. In another pool were large  (2 inch)  Tadpoles. Charlie's dog found
a beautiful Hognose Snake with bright yellow-orange pattern. Two Turkeys were
seen and a Vireo heard. Also a Woodchuck was seen among rocks on the
mountainside. The mountainside rock here seems to be dominantly thin bedded
sandstone.
<p> The forest
in the entire region seems retarded in leafing out compared to those of the
Staunton area despite the flowering of the Redbud in both areas. Tuliptree, in
particular, is far more leafed out in the Staunton area.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>4-26-95 Maple Flats / "Big Pond"[this is
Green Pond]</h3>
<ul>Robert Hunsucker and I made another trip to Maple Flats and hiked
past the Double Sinkhole Pond to the large pond with E-W orientation and the
Large Cranberry colonies discussed earlier. All ponds we saw were full of
water  photo #1 is of orange colored<i>
coronarium</i>(?) fungus on Va Pine
<p> I saw the
first Wild Ginger  (<i>Asarum canadense </i>) in this whole area along the
trail,<i> Perilla frutescens</i>, the introduced "Beefsteak plant" is
also common along the trail. Shrubs noted were <i>Hypericum hypericoides</i>
and Pinxter Azalea. <i>Amelanchier arborea </i>is common. Herbs noted were <i>Galium
aperine,</i> <i>Viola sagit</i>[t]<i>ata</i> (?, <i>Iris verna </i> (in bloom), 
<i>Danthonia spicata, Veronica officinalis</i>, <i>Carex artitecta, Melampyrum
lineare</i> and<i> Uvularia pudica</i> in beautiful bloom. Numerous butterflies
including various Swallowtails and Spring Azures were present and Woodpeckers
and possible warblers were heard. No sign of Gypsy Moth was seen and the oaks
were coming into leaf nicely.
<p> When we
reached the Big Pond[really Green Pond] we saw the entire surface dotted with
flowers of the Golden Club  (<i>Orentium aquaticum</i>)   Along the shore <i>Vaccinium corymbosum</i>
and<i> Menziesia pilosa</i> were leafing out. Photo #2 shows a Swamp Pink in
bloom partly submerged. Photo #3 is a general view of the Pond showing Golden
Club. Golden Club and Skunk Cabbage showed evidence of being fed upon either by
Muskrats or Beaver. There were also many trees with signs of the latter. Other
herbs noted were Fly Poison  Bracken Fern
and <i>Parnassia asarifolia</i>. Small <i>Aronia melanocarpa</i>  (glaberous
leaves)  were identified. <i>Lycopodium lucidulum</i> and <i>L. obscurum</i>
were noted. Photo # 4 is of a large <i>V.</i> <i>corymbosum.</i> We saw yellow
Swallowtail Butterflies and some Canada Geese set up a clamor on the pond. We
also saw a small warty Cricket Frog. on our way back we identified Mockernut
Hickory and Persimmon in the upland forest as well as<i> Carex laxiflora</i>  
<p> On the way
home we stopped along the road and photographed  (#5) <i> Vicia caroliniana</i>
in bloom. No Hawthorn was observed-as in previous trips to this area
</ul>
<p>

<h3>May 7, 1995</h3>
<ul>
Mike Jones and I made another visit to Big Pond[Green Pond] in Maple
Flats. It was a beautiful, sunny but cool Spring day.  We hiked from the Maple Flats parking lot on
Coal Road along the stream that skirts the east side of the artificial pond.
There we identified the Blue Marsh Violet  (<i>Viola cucullata </i>) with its
conspicuously tall flower stalks. It was very abundant. Also present was a
small White Violet, either<i> V. pallens </i>or<i> V. blanda</i>. Spice Bush
was noted as was Hay-scented Fern and a broad leafed, hairy Panic Grass.
Probably<i> Panicum boscii </i> A beautiful
Rose Breasted Grossdbeak was spotted in low trees and Vireos were heard. We
also saw a very warty gray Cricket Frog. We then bore NW past the small pond
just N of the last  (most northerly)  artificial pond, noting Cinnamon Fern,
4-leaved Yam and a single small possibly Hawthorn tree  (~3' high).  Photo #1
was taken of a Black Oak with swollen  (fire scar?)  base. We then reached the
road and proceeded N., taking the left branch at the Y. We then visited the
first small pond on the right just visible through the trees. On May 23 of last
yr this pond had much more water-Its where I saw the Broad headed Skink  Here we noted on the south side of the pond,
on dry mud flats a small plant with tiny, hairy leaves and remains of last
year's panicle, possibly a Lechea  Photo
#2 is ov this plant with Haircap Moss. Here we heard a Raven call. Along the
road we also saw <i>Vicia caroliniana</i> in bloom. Photos # 3 and 4 are of
fire-spaced sprout trees. We then visited the Double Pond noting small berries
already forming on <i>Vaccinium corymbosum </i>there. No sign of Gypsy Moth ?
Also much<i> Veronica officianalis</i>[spel.] was also noted on the road. We
then continued on to Big Pond[Green Pond] also on the right of the road. In the
western  (south side)  area of the pond wetland we observed <i>Uvularia
sessilifolia</i>  Photos 3 5, #6 and #7
of Golden Club and pond respectively 
Nearby but on edging upland noted first <i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>. We
also saw Hay-scented Fern and possibly <i>Viola hirsutula</i> we noted
"Witches Broom" growths in Service berry  (<i>A. arborea</i>),  also
a little Partridge Berry. Heard Yellow Billed Cuckoo call. We then continued to
the Pond inlet stream  (Canada Cr ?) 
coming from the south and flowing into the SE corner of the Pond. The
water of the Pond had dropped at least a foot since our April 26 visit. The
following vegetation dominated the boggy inlet creek area, Red Maple, Black
Gum, a little Pitch Pine, <i>Vaccinium corymbosum</i>, <i>Aronia</i> sp, <i>Ilex
verticillata</i>, Possum Haw, a little Mtn Laurel, Cinnamon Fern, Skunk Cabbage
 (very large),  Swamp Pink, Sphagnum 
Golden Club, Sedges, One Royal Fern, a little Indian Cucumber Root, One
Pink Ladyslipper  (in bloom)  much Teaberry.

<h3>5-21-95 Sideling Hill / Walker Mtn.</h3>
<ul> Steve Krichbaum
and I went to view the site of the proposed Sideling Hill Timber Sale. We
entered the Clayton Mill Creek Valley at Marble Valley and drove SW up the
Valley to the divide with little Mill Creek. The weather in the morning was
bright but partly cloudy. The forest at the divide consisted of White Oak,
Scarlet Oak  Bear Oak, Red Maple  Black Gum, Chestnut Oak, American Chestnut
Sprouts, Pitch Pine, White Pine, small Sassafras, Mtn Laurel  <i>Rhododendron nudiflorum </i> (in bloom), 
Sweet Fern, Black Huckleberry, <i>Vaccinium pallidum </i> (in bloom)   Herbs include Bracken Fern, Hay-scented Fern,
Iris sp, Teaberry, a dewberry, a <i>Hieracium </i>sp  Wild Indigo  (<i>Baptista tinctoria</i>).  A
Scarlet Tanager sang. Along woods road leading upslope from divide toward the
top of Sideling Hill we noted Black Oak, Black Locust, a small Virginia Pine,
Small shrubby Service Berry with glaberous leaves  (<i>V. spicata </i>?)  Scarlet Oak, higher up Chestnut Oak, American
Chestnut sprouts, Red Maple saplings, Witch hazel, <i>Amelanchier arborea,
Menziesia pilosa</i>, possible <i>Rhododendron roseum </i> (from glands on
ovary).  Herbs include <i>Coreopsis major, Lycopodium tristachyum, Potentilla
canadensis</i>, Trailing Arbutus, Spotted Wintergreen, <i>Veronica officinalis,
Dentaria spicata,</i> <i>Leucobryum</i> sp, Oxeye Daisy, <i>Viola hirsutula </i>(?),
"Velvet" moss,<i> Fragaria virginiana</i>. Most of the trees are no
more than 12 inches dbh  The area as a
whole has  one of the densest shrub
layer[s] I've seen. There are also scattered Flowering Dogwood and some
"British soldier' lichen. Pileated Woodpeckers, warblers, Vireos  were heard. Photos #1 and #2 were taken of
herbicide-killed shrubs near the road. From the divide we then headed down
stream SW on Little Mill Creek, which here is intermittent, flowing in places
beneath cobbles from a series of springs and side branches   It flows through a xeric, ericaceous oak
forest, but along its branches are abundant Red Maples and Black Gums with some
White Oak and a large White Pine. Down stream farther are Pitch Pine  Generally there are abundant Red Maple
seedlings. Understory consists of <i>Amelanchier arborea,</i> one little
browsed Hemlock  a little <i>Viburnum
dentatum </i> Mt Laurel, a few large
Blach haw Viburnum, <i>Lyonia ligustrina 
Vaccinium</i> <i>pallidum</i>, scattered Hawthorns  Photo #3 is a view downstream of the Creek
showing beautiful bordering Gums. Scattered <i>Smilax </i>sp In one place we
also saw  a few small shoots of <i>Aronia</i>
which from the smooth leaves appears to be <i>A melanocarpa. Rubus hispidus</i>
is quite common  Herbs seen include
Teaberry, Spotted Wintergreen "Velvet" moss, Dewberry, Hay Scented
Fern, Pink Ladyslipper  (bloom), <i> Panicum </i>grass, Interrupted Fern,
Cinnamon Fern <i>Sphagnum </i>patches, Christmas Fern, Indian Cucumberroot,
Haircap Moss, <i>Galium triflorum, Pyrola rotundifolia,</i> 4-leaved Yam,
Sedges, a fuzzy 4-leaved <i>Galium, Potentilla canadensis, a little Aralia
nudicaulis,</i> Whorled Loosestrife, Oxalis sp, Some times especially Maple
show fire scars. The forest, except for a few large Gums, appears to be ~ 50-60
yr old  Only one evidence of animal life
was seen in the stream, a small dark gray frog with a light strip along
the  mouth but no visible back pattern.
Yellow-billed Cuckoos were heard.
<p> We then did
another traverse toward the top of Sideling Hill ridge, this time using a woods
road perhaps 1/5 of a mile down stream on Little Mill Creek and leading to the
proposed cutting unit #1 of the Timber Sale. Near the start at lowest elevation
on the forest is dominated by White Oak with some Scarlet and Chestnut Oak,
Black Gum, Red Maple  A 6" dbh
American Chestnut was noted-apparently healthy[.]   Mtn
Laurel, Black Huckleberry and <i>Vaccinium pallidum</i> form a thick
undergrowth. At one place there was a beautiful clump of Lupine in bloom (
photo #4)   <i>Leucobryum</i> sp, Teaberry,
<i>Hypoxis hirsuta</i>, Trailing Arbutus, <i>Hieracium venosum,</i> Bracken
Fern are common and Deerberry was noted. Farther up Pitch Pine, Chestnut Oak
became more common and a little Pignut Hickory was noted. a small white violet,
perhaps <i>Viola pallens</i> occurs along the trail  Vireos were heard.  A little farther on we entered an area of
gentle slope and downslope an almost flat area of richer forest and larger
trees, quite open, with little shrub undergrowth. Northern Red Oak, Black Oak.
Red Maple, Black Gum, White Oak are quite large. Average dbh perhaps 18"
but some large Northern Red and White Oak exceed 32" dbh  (photo #5) 
There are scattered Black Haw Viburnum, Flowering Dogwood  Witchhazel. There are scattered large dying
Black Locust. A few Coral Berry bushes are also present. Herbs include a quite
a bit <i>Cynoglossum virginianum</i>  (in bloom)  some <i>Uvularia</i> <i>perfoliata,
Botrychium virginianum</i>, Black Cohosh  (quite stunted),  May Apple  (a patch), Hay Scented Fern, Sphagnum-like moss but dark green, This is <i>Climacium
americanum, Viola hirsutula </i>[ Southern Woodland Violet ](?) Several
Pileated Woodpeckers were seen  Quite
generally there is a substantial number of Red Maple seedlings here. A very
little Partridge Berry was seen.
<p> Next, in
the late afternoon we drove down the little Mill Creek Valley noting the
destructively herbicided forest undergrowth on the Walker Mtn side. About a
mile SW of the divide we hiked up another road that again angled up toward the
Sideling hill crest, crossing Little Mill Creek near the road. The forest here
is similar to that at the divide. At one place we startled about 8 Turkey
Vultures that had been on the ground in heavy undergrowth about 200 ft off the
trail, apparently at some carcase[spel.] 
We noted<i> Viola pedata</i>. At the top of Sideling Hill at about 2600'
asl near a gap, the forest consists of Chestnut Oak essentially with a heavy
undergrowth of Bear Oak, Mt Laurel, Black Huckleberry, <i>Lyonia ligustrina.</i>
There is also some Pitch Pine, rather small Black Gum, perhaps dating to fire
suppression's start, and the usual American Chestnut sprouts. There also appears
to be some Northern Red Oak and<i> Vaccinium pallidum</i> and Deerberry and <i>Menziesia
pilosa</i>. One Hazelnut bush was noted. Some of the pines show blackened bark
and there are fire-spaced Chestnut Oak clumps. Coreopsis major is common on the
trail and Pink Ladyslipper in bloom was seen. Teaberry and Trailing Arbutus as
well as the same tiny White Violet were seen. Most trees in the area are
10" dbh or less and here too the undergrowth is very heavy.
<p> On the
drive out toward Marble Valley we saw a beautiful pigeon-sized Coopers Hawk at
the edge of the road, then fly to a nearby tree and perch again.
<p> The entire
area visited has a poverty in certain species such as Black Birch   (none seen)  
Sugar Maple  (none seen),  White Ash  (none seen),  hickories  (only a
few pignut),  Tuliptree  (none seen in areas visited),  few if any sedges
except along the stream. Also no basswoods, elms  Beech, Black Cherry, not to mention a host of
even more demanding species. The species observed are thus the least demanding
Appalachian species.
<p> Both Walker
Mtn and Sideling Hill appear to be formed of resistant Keefer Sandstone of
Silurian age which probably explains in part the severe conditions here.
Conglomeratic sandstone was sited[spel?] near the top of Sideling Hill.
