 <strong>5-27,28,29-95 Bluestone West Va. Conference Center  Heartwood Meeting at Bluestone Lake Conference
Center at Bluestone Reservoir, West Va.</strong>
<ul>
 I led two botanical walks that were
well attended   The first was in the
woods NW of the large field where I parked my pickup  (in which I slept).  The
night before we heard Whippoorwills call 
Also Brown Thrashers and Wood Thrush seemed abundant around the clearing
in the woods.  The forest here is mesic
but with increasing oaks on upland. Dominant trees are White Oak, Black Oak,
Scarlet Oak, Black Cherry, Red Maple, Cucumber Magnolia  White Ash, Black Locust, Northern Red Oak,
Chestnut Oak  Beech, Sugar Maple,
Shagbark Hickory, Pignut Hickory, Mockernut Hickory(?), Virginia Pine, White
Pine, Sassafras, Sourwood, Yellow Buckeye. Flowering Dogwood is abundant and in
some places, where more moisture is available, there is a dense understory of
Paw Paw and Spice Bush. Black Haw Viburnum, Red Bud, Service Berry and Hop
Hornbeam occur. One Wahoo bush was noted. There is a little Witch hazel in
places and in dryer areas under oak, Deer Berry and a low Blueberry  (<i>V
pallidum </i>?). Maple leaf Viburnum also occurs. Smilax species, including S<i>milax
rotundifolia</i> occur and vines include Virginia Creeper, Poison Ivy and
various grapes. There's some<i> Rubus</i>  (Dewberries).  Herbaceous species
include<i> Geranium maculatum,</i> 4-leaved Yam, a little May Apple  (stunted), Violet Wood Sorrel, <i>Sedum ternatum, Heuchera americana</i>, White Snake
Root, <i>Veronica officinalis, Galium triflorum,</i> Hog Peanut,<i> Potentilla
simplex</i>, Spotted Wintergreen, Plume Lily, Hairy Wood Rush, <i>Carex platyphylla,
Carex hirsutella,</i> <i>Carex radiata, Hypoxis hisuta  Cunilla origanoides,</i> Squaw Root, Christmas
Fern, <i>Botrychium virginianum, Asplenium platneuron, Polygonum virginianum,
Hackelia</i> <i>virginiana, Salvia lyrata Tradescantia virginiana </i> (in
bloom), <i> Leucobryum </i>sp and other mosses in dry areas, <i>Verbesina
occidentalis</i> in open areas. <i>Hieracium venosum</i> is common in dry
areas. Apparent basal fire scars occur. We heard Scarlet Tanagers call. <i>Hepatica
americana</i> was noted also.
<p />May 28 The second walk was along Beech Trail to the
south. The moister areas here are dominated by Yellow Buckeye  (mostly small to
saplings)   Tuliptree, White Oak Black
Locust, Beech, Northern Red Oak, White Ash 
Black Oak, Shagbark  Black Walnut<i>  Magnolia acuminata</i>, Slippery Elm, Red and
Sugar Maples, Black Gum. Dryer areas contain the above oaks and in addition
Chestnut and Scarlet Oaks and Sourwood and Sassafras. There are also a few
Sycamores in moist areas. Understory is dominated by Flowering Dogwood, some
Witchhazel, Red Bud, a little Musclewood was seen and Black Haw Viburnum is
common. There is only a little Pignut Hickory. White Pine is scattered and in
old fields  Virginia Pine is common.
Deerberry and low Blueberry occur in dry areas. <i>Smilax</i> sp  Virginia Creeper and Poison Ivy are common.
Herbs include <i>Senecio obovatus, S. aureus </i> (the former in bloom).  <i>Sedum
ternatum, Osmorhiza longistylis, Verbesina occidentalis</i>, White Snakeroot (
abundant),  Hog Peanut, Christmas Fern,<i> Botrychium virginianum,</i> <i>Asplenium
platyneuron</i>  (only ferns) <i> Galium aperine</i> and <i>G. triflorum, G,
circaezans, Carex platyphylla,</i> <i>Carex</i> sp, grasses  <i>Viola </i>spp, a little <i>Goodyera,
Dentaria</i> laciniata, Honewort, Rue Anemone Jewel Plant[ Jewelweed ]  (<i>Impatiens</i>
sp)   <i>Cardamine</i> <i>impatiens</i>, <i>Disporum
lanuginosum,</i> Canada Moonseed. 
<p /> In one
place an area of Virginia Pine on a fairly high site was being invaded by
hardwoods, including Buckeye seedlings. No Striped Maple  Little or no herbaceous vegetation was
present. The whole area at the site of both walks appears to have suffered
degradation of its herbaceous vegetation since in such a rich forest with
Buckeye and other mesic species one would expect many more species.  Black Cohosh <i> Uvularia, Trillium </i>and other species of
lily family were missing, among others. This hints that tree species of a
degraded mixed mesophyte forest can recover much faster than herbaceous
species.
<p /> Another
characteristic of the whole region appears to be a patchy pattern of abundant
lichens on tree trunks as compared with other Central Appalachian areas
visited.

 <strong>6-4-95 East Dry Branch / Little North Mtn.  (Proposed
"Little Big Woods" T. S.)  Steve Krichbaum and I went to view the
proposed timber sale</strong>
<ul>

<p />  Weather was mild
and humid, mostly cloudy. The entire area which lies between RT 688, East Dry
Branch and Little North Mountain has been stripped by the Gypsy Moth which is
current for the first, perhaps peak year Oaks are mostly stripped of all leaves
and even Red Maple is severely defoliated.
<p />  Beginning
at RT 688 we traversed along a Forest development road that trends first a
little SE and then turns gradually NE. The total length is several miles. This
road lies generally between East Dry Branch and the Crest of Little North
Mountain. Elevation at the start is a little below 2000' asl and it reaches
somewhat more than 2100' asl. Between RT 688 and where the traverse crosses the
power line the forest consists of Northern Red Oak, White Oak  Chestnut Oak, Red Maple, Black Gum, Pitch
Pine  Black Locust, Black Cherry, White
Pine, Scarlet Oak  with understory of
Service berry, Blackhaw Viburnum 
Hawthorn, Sassafras, Flowering Dogwood, Hemlock  (mostly free of
Adelgid, but some have it).  Shrubs include Deerberry (<i> V pallidum</i> ?).
Herbs noted were <i>Potentilla</i> (<i> simplex</i> ?),  <i>Aster</i> <i>divaricatus</i>,
Honewort, <i>Houstonia longifolia,</i> Agrimony sp, <i>Hieracium venenosum,</i>
Pink Ladyslipper (flower fading),  Trailing Arbutus Whorled Loosestrife,
Blue-eyed Grass, Spotted Wintergreen. Vines include Poison Ivy, Virginia
Creeper, <i>Smilax rotundifolia </i> There are also various <i>Rubus</i>  (Black
and Dew Berries)   Yellow Billed Cuckoos
and a Cicada that sounded like " 17 yr locust" were heard. Continuing
past the Powerline the first Pignut, Tuliptree, Cucumber Magnolia and Black
Birch was noted. One small Virginia Juniper[also known as "Red
Cedar"] was in the trail. We saw the first Black Huckleberry, Sweet Fern <i> Lyonia ligustrina</i> and a little Witchhazel.
 The undergrowth is very lush, consisting
mostly of Laurel and Black Gum but also includes <i>Menziesia pilosa</i>. There
are a few American Chestnut Sprouts. Black Oak also occurs here  as does Scarlet Oak. Herbs include Teaberry, <i>Coreopsis
major</i>, possible <i>Fragaria vesca, Cladonia</i>  Wild Indigo, Dwarf Iris (sp?) and Hayscented
Fern becomes common. We noted several Chestnut and Scarlet Oaks that were
little defoliated by the Moth. Just after the road begins to climb we noted our
first Striped Maple, here at perhaps a little over 2000' asl and shortly
thereafter it becomes very abundant and quite large in places. <i>Menziesia </i>also
increases. We had been hearing Scarlet Tanagers. Some large Tuliptrees and
Cucumber Magnolias seem little touched by the Moth. Our first 4-leaved Yam was
seen. As we top the rise the forest becomes more open with little undergrowth
We see our first <i>Goodyera pubera, Uvularia pudica  Prenanthese</i> sp, a small White Ash and
hear Vireos call  Many of the trees, here
18" dbh and larger and perhaps 80 yrs old or more, show basal fire scars.
These appear to be mostly Northern Red Oak. Striped Maple continues abundant.
Down hill from here there is again a heavy undergrowth of Laurel, <i>Menziesia</i>
etc. Pileated Woodpeckers were heard and we noted a lot of <i>Cunila origaoides</i>
in the path, White Snakeroot is abundant 
Grape vines are present along here and little affected by the Moth.
Cuckoos and Tanagers were again heard 
Photo #1 is of mohr[mor] layer in soil. Here the trail descends again
and we note the first Spicebush in a small cove of Tuliptree, Cucumber
Magnolia, stunted Black Cohosh, <i>Aster divaricatus </i>Christmas Fern <i>Asplenium</i>
<i>platyneuron, Uvularia </i>sp, Virginia Creeper  Sensitive Fern, Hog Peanut, Sugar Maple, Possibly
Also<i> Carex laevivaginata  C. scoparia</i>
and <i>C. baileyi</i>  Photo #2 is of
virus affected Gypsy Moth larvae on Chestnut Oak  Near here we also saw a Butternut Sapling
which had no defoliation by the Moth. A seep near here has abundant Tuliptree,
Black Cohosh, <i>Galium triflorum</i>, Hay Scented Fern, Christmas Fern,
possible Lady Fern, <i>Viola</i> spp., <i>Hypericum punctatum, Geranium
maculatum. </i>Steve saw two species of salamanders and there was a beautiful
tan 3" Millipede. A little farther on we saw a Staghorn Sumac.s We then
reached where the trail / road turns sharply to the left directly down hill in
a concavity with a northern aspect. Here in the Hemlock and Tuliptree-rich
woods we encountered our first <i>Aralia nudicaulis</i> and Indian
Cucumberroot. After crossing the forest boundary here we came upon a pond and a
small logging operation. At this pond we saw a small Northern Watersnake
basking on a down tree above the pond. Defoliation by the Gypsy Moth ceased
abruptly at the Forest Boundary with none apparent on private land so that it
would seem that the latter had been effectively sprayed (?). From the boundary
area we then made a loop toward the crest of Little North Mtn toward the trail
again, mainly to survey some proposed potential "old growth",
"dry mesic" forest as stated in the scoping notice. This tract
extended SW from the boundary bounded by a line a little uphill from the road
and the crest for perhaps 3/4 mile according to the map. The lower slopes
consisted of quite mesic forest dominated by fairly large Tuliptree, White and
Northern Red Oak, Red Maple with abundant Striped Maple, many small saplings
and little herbaceous vegetation. Squaw root parasite is common. There is some
Black Gum and stunted May Apple. Most Hemlock here looks healthy with no sign
of the Adelgid. Flowering Dogwood is common. A little farther on, up the slope,
in the so called potential "old growth", the forest is not "dry
mesic" but xeric, ericaceous, dominantly Chestnut Oak with Laurel
understory and a mohr[mor]/moss layer (<i> Leucobryum </i>sp etc)   In one place, lower down on the slope we saw
the largest American Chestnut sprout ever, a double ~9" dbh tree, somewhat
diseased but in a vigorous healing mode. Lots of fire scars at tree bases This
proposed old growth is probably not old since its trees are seldom more than
12" dbh  The slope is very steep and
would be difficult to log and of poor quality trees-probably the explanation.
Continuing on our loop toward the trail we came upon a shallow cove in which
stood a single Black Walnut. Hay Scented Fern, Wild Comfrey were common here
also. After reaching the trail again I took photo #3 of mature forest downslope
showing good site index and defoliation. Farther on we saw in the trail / road
a large type "tiger beetle" perhaps a ground beetle of the genus <i>Colosoma</i>,
more than an inch in length with a purple head, blue pronotum and elytra of
gold red and green iridescent colors contributed to by the refraction of fine
lines on the latter. We saw another of these beetles later, moving rapidly on
the forest floor  They may have been
feeding on the Gypsy Moth larvae  One of
our final observations was of a blooming Partridge Berry under a Pitch Pine (
photo #4).  Regarding resistance to Gypsy Moth defoliation the rank appears to
be Cucumber Magnolia; Tuliptree, White Ash, Virginia Creeper, Black Gum  Striped Maple, Sassafras, Red Maple, oaks.
White Pine, in some cases is also hard hit, with almost complete defoliation,
complete for saplings. Even small Pitch Pine are defoliated

<p /> <strong>6-11,12-95 Cranesville Swamp elevation 2500' asl  Steve Krichbaum and I were at Cranesville
Swamp  on the West Va / Maryland line
with Robert Hunsucker and his friend Dottie</strong>
<ul>




<p />  
The weather was cloudy, threatening rain on the 11th, rained all night
and was rainy and cool on the 12th.  The
forest around the swamp consists largely of planted Red Pine, Norway Spruce,
White Pine etc with some natural regrowth of Black Cherry  (does well here)  Red Maple Red Spruce Hemlock  Black Locust, White Pine  with understory of Hawthorn. Under these
trees the most abundant ground cover is <i>Rubus hispidus, Lycopodium
flabelliforme, L. obscurum</i>, <i>Maianthemum canadense </i> Partridge Berry  <i>Dryopterus spinulosa </i>and <i>intermedia</i>,
Indian Cucumber root, Skunk Cabbage, Gay Wings 
Of these<i> Rubus hispidus</i> the Lycopods and <i>M. canadense</i> are
the most common. There is also Hay Scented Fern and some <i>Aronia melanocarpa</i>,
4-leaved Yam. In some places there are dense patches of Goldthread  (Photo #4,
June 12)   In one place the Goldthread
community consisted of Black Cherry, Hemlock  (healthy),  Cinnamon Fern, <i>Lycopodium
obscurum, L. digitatum</i> (<i> flabelliforme</i>)   Indian Cucumberroot,<i> Maianthemum</i> <i>canadense</i>,
Red Maple, Service Berry, <i>Aronia melanocarpa, Rubus hispidus,</i> Northern
Red Oak, <i>Carex gracilescens </i>was off to the side. Goldthread frequently
was found on E-facing banks and on elevated soil on tree roots and intergrown
with <i>Rubus hispidus</i>-also<i> Vaccinium angustifoium</i>. 
<p />  The
swamp itself consists of Central Sphagnum / Cranberry bog with enveloping shrub
swamp, scattered sedge meadows beaver floodings. In places steep banked small
streams flow through these swamps  In
places old beaver floodings are marked by extensive stands of dead trees,
mostly Red Maple. Trees are scattered within the swamp and consist of Red
Spruce, Hemlock  (Adelgid-free),  White and Pitch Pine, Red Maple, Black Cherry
 (in dryer areas)   Small trees include
Hawthorn, <i>Malus coronaria </i> Mtn Ash
 (in bloom),  Service Berry  (<i>Amelanchier laevis</i> ?). In wet areas the
most common shrub is Speckled Alder followed by Wild Raisin. <i>Aronia
melanocarpa </i> (in bloom)  seems omnipresent. <i>Viburnum dentatum</i> is
abundant. There are scattered <i>Nemopanthus mucronatus</i>  <i>Sambucus canadensis  Ilex</i> <i>verticillata </i> Mtn Laurel and rare Great Rhododendron and
Witchhazel. The most common blueberry is <i>Vaccinium myrtilloides </i>with
some<i> V angustifolium</i>. In dryer areas are the lushest Deer Berry  (<i>V
stamineum</i>)  bushes  (in bloom)  I ever saw. Also the <i>V myrtilloides</i>
already had small green berries. In a few places within the brushy sedge
meadows we encountered Cranberry patches, probably <i>V. oxycoccos </i>(?). I
also noted that the Mtn Laurel was just beginning to bloom whereas it had been
blooming for some time in the mountains to the south.  No <i>Menziesia  </i>Striped or Mtn Maple were seen  A few patches of Blackberries were also seen
but don't seem to thrive, perhaps because of the acid conditions. In dryer
areas ground cover is dominated by<i> Rubus hispidus</i> and both <i>Potentilla
canadensis</i> and <i>P simplex </i>appear to occur.<i> Fragaria virginiana </i>was
noted Fire Cherry occurs and one Choke Cherry was seen. Teaberry and Trailing
Arbutus are common. A few plants of <i>Aralia</i> <i>nudicaulis</i> were seen.
Skunk Cabbage is very abundant in moist areas. <i>Gentiana linearis</i> occurs,
as does <i>Polygonum sagittatum</i>, <i>Lycopus</i> sp. In openings <i>Solidago
rugosa</i> is very common and in moister openings <i>S. uliginosa</i> rosettes
but no tall stems. Two species of <i>Cornus</i> present Ferns are quite
abundant with large conspicuous Cinnamon Fern in full "fruit". Also
Interrupted Fern, Sensitive Fern,  Hay Scented Fern, a few <i>Thelypteris
simulata</i> and<i> Dryopteris cristata</i> and much Bracken Fern. Spinulose
Shield Fern occurs on forest edges. New York Fern occurs but is not abundant. <i>Hypericum</i>
<i>densiflorum </i>is almost omnipresent. Sedges occur in great variety and
include <i>C</i>. <i>gracilescens, C folliculata </i> (widespread), <i> C.
stricta, C. crinita</i>  (common),  <i>C. lurida, C. scoparia, C. interior </i>(
photo #2) <i> </i> (widespread <i>), C. bailey, C. intumescens, C. stipada, C.
rostrata, C. canescens </i>  In places there are large patches of <i>Lycopodium</i>
<i>flabelliforme and L, obscurum. L. clavatum </i>occurs. A common grass here
is the rough-stemmed <i>Panicum clandestinum</i> which also occurs along woods
trails. Another is <i>P. dichotomum 
Danthonia</i> <i>spicata</i> forms scattered clumps in dryer areas. The
aliens <i>Poa trivialis, Holcus lanatus</i>  (Velvet grass)  occurs along the
trail near the parking lot. In a few places <i>Rumex acetocella </i>grows like
a native.<i> Juncus effusus</i> occurs as does Eleocharis sp. ; also a <i>Sphagnum
</i>sp., <i>Glyceria</i> <i>striata, Scutellaria lateriflora, Lindernia dubia</i>.
In places there are mats of the moss <i>Polytrichum commune</i> or <i>Sphagnum,</i>
the latter with<i> Drosera rotundifolia </i> (photo #1)  Jewel Plant[Jewelweed]
 (<i>Impatiens</i> sp)  is widespread. <i>Ludwigia palustris</i> and <i>Epilobium
</i>sp  <i>Hypericum virginicum</i>. In
one of the small streams we noted a water starwort,<i> Callitriche heterophylla</i>.
In many meadow areas in the swamp there is a dense, blueish[spel.] green grass
 (photo #3)  we have taken to be a <i>Calamagrostis</i> sp[<i>canadensis</i>] (
Blue Joint).  We heard Veeries call frequently and heard Scarlet Tanagers even
out in the open swamp. We heard unidentified warblers and the Common
Yellowthroat. In one place we heard a Mallard Duck and Green Frogs croak.
Beaver dams, lodges and ponds with acres of dead Alders occur. In some places
in what appeared to be quite acid ground we saw large holes and casting of
Crayfish. Photo #5 is a panorama  of the
swamp from the NE along the road in Maryland. The mushroom <i>Tricholomopsis
platyphylla</i> appears to be quite common. late note from Robert Carex
lacustris 
<p />  On a
rainy Monday morning Dottie and I went to the Southern section of the swamp to
see the "Jacobs Ladder" (<i> Polemonium van-bruntiae</i>[) ], which
here occurs in a 1/8 acre patch  (in bloom)  
 (photos #1,2 and 3 of new film)  where it occurs with Black Elderberry,
Skunk Cabbage, Cattail[broad-leaved ], Cinnamon Fern,<i> Solidago rugosa,
Angelica atropurpurea</i>. We then returned to the Nature Conservancy Parking
lot and hiked through the woods toward the Board Walk  (photo #4 is of
Goldthread along the way).  On the Board Walk took photo #5 of Bladderwort in
bloom  (yellow flowers)  and a general view of the open bog  (photo #6).  The
plant community here consists Red Spruce, Larch, Pitch and White Pine,
Hemlock  Red Maple, Skunk Cabbage  Wild Raisin, <i>Viburnum dentatum </i> Cinnamon Fern, <i>Vaccinium myrtilloides,
Carex folliculata, Vaccinium oxycoccos</i> (?), Sphagnum, <i>Rubus hipidus,
Carex crinita, Hypericum densiflorum, Solidago uliginosa Nemotanthus mucronata,
Leersia</i> sp, <i>Aronia melanocarpa</i> 
Cattail  (<i>Typha latifolia</i>).  This cattail is widely spaced and
not too vigorous appearing in this acid environment  A Gray Catbird, Chickadees and a possible
Swamp Sparrow were heard. I couldn't say definitely which Cranberry or both are
present here in the absence of flowers. One place in the swamp was an upwelling
of clear water through the sand like an artesian spring.
<p />  Campground
at Garret State Forest  (Swallow Falls State Forest)  This campground is about
5 miles SE of the Cranesville Nature Coservancy parking lot and bulletin board.
The elevation is a little higher, perhaps between 2600' and 2900 ft.  The forest is young  (~35-40 yrs),  quite
mesic. The dominant trees are White Oak, Black Cherry, Red maple, Northern Red,
Black and Scarlet Oak perhaps in that order. Service Berry  Hawthorn and Witch hazel are common. There is
a little Black Birch and Sassafras. No Flowering Dogwood Tuliptree Chestnut
Oak  Shrubs include <i>Aronia melanocarpa</i>  Wild Raisin, <i>Vaccinium pallidum  Rhododendron arborescens, Vaccinium
myrtilloides</i> Herbs include White Clintonia  (in bloom),  Trailing Arbutus,
Teaberry  (both on road bank),  <i>Rubus hispidus </i> (the dominant ground
cover),  Spring Bluet, Cinnamon and Bracken Ferns,<i> Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>  Indian Cucumberroot, 4-leaved Yam, <i>Maianthemum
canadense </i> (very abundant),  White Violet (<i> Blanda-pallida</i> complex) 
<i>Potentilla </i>sp.  (<i>canadensis/simplex </i>),<i> Scirpus atrovirens,
Smilax glauca,</i> Hay-scented Fern  (common),  N.Y. Fern  (scattered)<i>  Panicum clandestinum, Aster simplex, A.
macrophyllus, A. acuminatus, Ranunculus septentrionalis, Glyceria striata</i>
(managrass[spel.]),  <i>Leersia virginica, Monarda clinopodia, Lilium
canadense, Solidago rugosa, Luzula</i> <i>echinata, L. acuminata Oxalis
stricta, Dryopteris intermedia, Oxypolis rigidior,</i> <i>Smilax hispida</i>, <i>Dryopteris
spinulosa</i>, Interrupted Fern,<i> Lycopodium lucidulum, Smilax herbacea</i>,
Gay Wings<i>  Solidago caesia, Carex
digitalis Aronia melanocarpa  Lycopodium
clavatum </i> Possible Solitary Vireo was
heard 
<p />  This is
a rich mesic, acid forest of considerable diversity with straight, high site
index trees and substantial undergrowth. It is basically northern hardwood /
Allegheny [forest] in which Black Cherry does well. Except for species such as
White Clintonia its herbs are strongly northern as are its shrubs. In places
along the road this forest has considerable healthy-appearing Hemlock. We saw
one clump of American Chestnut.

was heard. The forest here are Red Maple, Cucumber Magnolia, Sourwood trees,
Northern Red Oak, Fraser Magnolia, <i>Rhododendron maximum,</i> Partridge
Berry  Striped Maple, Witchhazel.
Hemlock, Christmas Fern, Sugar Maple, <i>Danthonia compressa </i>is all along
the trail. The forest then appears less acid again as we clime[spel] and we see
Broad Beech Fern. But then we see our first <i>Menziesia pilosa</i> and Black
Gum  (small)   This [is] followed by
Black Cohosh sp, <i>Sanicula canadensis, Vitis aestivalis,</i> <i>Hieracium
paniculata, Uvularia pudica  Zizia aurea,</i>
Small American Chestnut Sprout, fairly large Flowering Dogwoods, long dead  (no
living F Dogwood seen),  Native Thistle,<i> Lobelia inflata, Galium
latifolium  Carex laxiflora,</i>
Dutchmans Pipe Vine, White Ash, Putty Root  (in seed), <i> Campanula Americana,
Erechtites</i> <i>hieracifolia, Arabis laevigata, Cimicifuga racemosa</i>  Virginia Creeper, <i>Circaea quadrisulcata,
Rubus odoratus  Botrychium virginianum.</i>
Here I took photo #3 of the very rocky mountainside with Hemlock. Here also
appeared the first Yellow Birch since leaving the flats, perhaps at~3500' asl.
Here also<i> Aster acuminatus, Tilia</i> <i>americana Ribes cynosbati,</i> a
"rocky woods" species. Virginia Creeper Foam Flower, <i>Trillium
erectum, Rubus canadensis, Viola canadensis, Asarum canadense</i>, a White
Basswood leaf. At this point we reached the vicinity of Comer Creek Falls at
perhaps 3200' asl (?). Here appeared the first <i>Maianthemum canadense</i>
since the Valley flat. Here we noted New York Fern, Sugar Maple, Black Cherry,
Northern Red Oak, Black Birch, Virgins Bower Witchhazel,<i> Solidago rugosa,</i>
Black Locust Blue-eyed Grass <i> Aster
divaricatus  Aster lateriflorus, Vitis
aestivalis, Fragaria vesca.</i> On the way down heard Pileated Woodpecker. Note
only Hickory seedlings were seen except for one possible Shagbark
<p />  The
forest here is remarkable for the occurrence of northern and mountain
species-Painted Trillium, <i>Maianthemum canadense,</i> Souther Mountain
Cranberry, <i>Habenaria rotundifolia</i>-on the Valley flat, perhaps due to
cold air drainage, there[spel.] disappearance on the slope above and
reappearance-Yellow Birch, <i>Maianthemum canadense  Aster acuminatus</i>-farther up near the
falls.

Diphylleia cymosa </i> Red Elderberry, <i>Disporum
lanuginosum, Rubus canadensis Carex gracilescens  </i>Photo #1 is of huge <i>Diphylleia cymosa </i>Northern
Red Oak, <i>Solidago caesia.</i> At some point along this traverse we exceeded
5000 ft asl and continued along at ~5200' or more roughly along a contour.
Continuing we see <i>Galium triflorum  Polygonum pubescens</i>. Large Land Snail, Golden
Ragwort  Shining Clubmoss, Oswego Tea, <i>Rhododendron

Apple, Witch hazel  4-leaved Yam, <i>Aster
divaricatus</i>, Yellow Buckeye here all above 5100' asl (?), <i>Carex
brunescens, Maianthemum canadense </i>in bloom at this elevation. <i>Viburnum
alnifolium</i> increases upward in the more mesic areas  Also <i>Carex intumescens</i> occurs along
most of the trail  Here we flushed a
flock of Ruffed Grouse which flew off. Here at almost 5200' asl occurs May
Apple not far from the edge of the meadow to the west. Aspect along most of the
trail so far has been SE. Habitat has been mostly slightly acidic-mesic
alternating with smaller stretches of more acidic environment with more
Clintonia, Shining Clubmoss, <i>Maianthemum</i>, Partridge Berry etc   The
upper part of the trail seems dryer with less lush vegetation, more acid with
less diversity.
<p />
<p />  At this
point the trail enters the meadow which was white with blossoms of <i>Potentilla
tridentata</i>, some yellow flowers of <i>Potentilla canadensis/simplex</i>?.
Photo #4 is of<i> Potentillas tridentata</i>. Other species are <i>Houstonia
serpyllifolia </i> (in bloom)  May have been [<i>H</i>] <i>caerulia</i>,    a large alien Hawkweed, Hay Scented Fern,
isolated Choke Cherry trees, shrubby Beech 
No <i>Aralia nudicaulis </i>or<i> Panax</i> were seen  no Black Birch  In some places highly pigmented, orange
Whorled Loosestrife and <i>Aster undulatus </i>cover the meadow. There is also <i>Solidago
rugosa, Fragaria virginica </i>and isolated contorted Hawthorn trees, Grays
Lily  (photo #5),  <i>Viola sagittata, Solidago</i> <i>hispida  Luzula echinata, Luzula multiflora, Aster
laevis Senecio smallii, Solidago juncea, </i>Several small garter snakes fled on
approach and had been sunning themselves Black berries are very common on the
edge of the Red Spruce forest as are Mountain Ash and Red Elderberry. This
meadow does not contain a particularly northern community except for <i>Potentilla
tridentata</i> The road to the top is flanked by these and Golden Ragwort is
roadside ground cover, some is in bloom. Fire Cherry was also noted, as was <i>Ribes
rotundifolia</i> (?). The aspect here is SE to S. The top appears to be pure
Red Spruce forest with some Mtn Ash and Yellow Birch. Ground cover under spruce
is<i> Oxalis montana</i>  (no blossoms), <i> Dryopteris spinulosa,</i> <i>Bazzania
trilobata </i>and mosses. Photo #6 is of more open Spruce forest with ferns (
Hay scented ?)  ground cover and 16" dbh trees. Photo 37 is of shrubby
Beech on the lower slope adjacent and below the Red Spruce forest. This forest
seemed healthy if a little dry. We saw no Fraser Fir which I assume was on more
NE slopes,[ Does it occur at all on this mountain?]  There is a drastic decrease in diversity from
deciduous to pure Spruce forest. No <i>Vitis</i> or <i>Parthenocissus </i>seen
anywhere  also no <i>Rhus radicans</i>-or
any <i>Rhus</i>
<p />  On late
note from Robert on Whitetop meadow: <i>Festuca rubra  Carex</i> tenera, <i>C, normalis</i>
<p />  Note no
hickories were seen on this traverse and only one oak, Northern Red Oak

<p /> <strong>6-19-95 Return from Mt. Rogers We returned via the Blue
Ridge Parkway in mostly rainy weather </strong>
<ul>
 
  On the highest part of the Parkway near
Thunder Riodge  (elevation ~3800')  noted Va Creeper of a type climbing up
trees but no <i>Vitis</i>. Also noted Goats Beard in bloom-or false Goats beard
at these high elevations 
<p />  On the
way followed Rt 42 to Covington and South of Covington for many miles heard and
saw signs of 17 year locusts
