<h3>Skidmore
Rendezvous (continued) </h3>
 

<p>Galium circaezans (Wild licorice) is common. Impatiens
capensis (Orange Jewelweed) occurs in some moist areas a</p>
 
<p>s does a Polygonum (sp.?). Also seen was a patch of
Bottlebrush Grass, large clumps of a large Panicum, a Dogbane, Panicum
dichtomum, Virginia Creeper occurs in a few places, as does Uvularia
perfoliata. Campanula divaricata, Hieracium paniculatum, Clearweed, a little
Bloodroot, Specularia perfoliata, Indian Pipe, Gnphalium obtusifolium occur in
some places; an Enchanted Nightshade that appears to be Circaea alpina is
abundant. It has all C. alpina characteristics except prominent tubers on its
roots Then it's C. quadrisulcata. One plant of Polypodium vulgare (P.
virginianum) was found on a steep mossy bank. Christmas Fern is also common
throughout. Old Man of the Woods mushrooms are very common and Chantrelles were
noted. Lobelia inflata (in bloom) [occurs ]. We heard a few Whippoorwills and
I heard a Catbird. We saw a single female Gypsy Moth almost dead on the ground.
Mosses are quite abundant and in some places there are patches of the dark
green-yellowish Sphagnum-like moss (This is Climacium americanum). </p>
<p>Northern characteristics here are shown by the abundance
of Maianthemum canadense, Starflowe and possible Circea alpina (?) No Aralia
nudicaulis or Poison Ivy were noted in this entire area. Also no Gaultheria. As is usual the Valley floor consists of flat
sandstone cobblestones and during dry weather the stream flows out of site
beneath these. As usual also, there is evidence of frequent channel shifting in
the form of dry channels. We noted aqgain thje clo0uds of minute yellow flying and hopping insects with
small black eyes that I'd never seen elsewhere.</p>
 

<h3>Survey of
Clayton Mill Springs</h3>
<p>Special Interest
Area - Biologic and Vicinity</p>
<p>1700 - 1800 ft asl</p>
 
<p>On Aug. 14, 1994 Mike Jones, Steve Krichbaum and R F
Mueller of Virginians for Wilderness and Shay Clanton made a rapid survey of<a
name=Dropdown1> the Clayton Miil Spring Special Interest Area Biologic and
Vicinity. We followed the first major branch of Clayton Mill Creek upstream to
the spring source in the SIA. The first
reach of this branch passes close to the cutting unit #4 of the proposed Marble
Valley Timber Sale. We also followed the diversion branch downstream to the
road from the spring area and explored farther in the upland forest of the
project area and along Forest Road 1676. </a></p>
 
<p>The immediate vicinity of the lower branch stream,
where it joins the main stem of Clayton Mill Creek, is quite rich, perhaps near
circumneutral (near pH 7) mesic forest. However virually the entire area
upstream along the branch is quite acidic though still mesic (medium moist) in character. Because of prevalent good
drainage however, there are no true hydric conditions except in the stream bed.
The stream bed, which consists of coarse flagstones and cobbles, is up to 10
meters in width but the rapidly flowing water is usually only a decimeter or
less in depth. The many protruding rocks and boulders and down trees of the
stream course are covered with a rich growth of mosses, liverworts and lichens
through which grow a variety of flowering plants to be discussed later.</p>

<p> The
branch stream flows between quite high banks through an essentialay upland
forest dominated by Northern Red Oak, Scarlet Oak, Black Oak, Chestnut Oak and
White Oak with minor Black Gum, red Maple, Sassafras, Pignut Hickory and Pitch
Pine. Hemlock, White Pine, Tuliptree, Black Birch, Red Maple and Northern Red
Oak are concentrated near the stream where thy reach large sizes. American
Chestnut (Castanea dentata) occurs as sprouts. Understory shrubs and trees in
the upland forest include Mountain Laurel (Kalmia latifolia), Minibush 
(Menziesia pilosa) and Flowering Dogwood (Cornus florida). Ground cover
includes Teaberry (Gaultheria procumbens)
, Spotted Witergreen (Chimaphilla maculata), Roundlobe Hepatica (Hepatica
americana), Rattlesnake Plantain (Goodyera pubescens), Pink Ladyslipper 
(Cypripedium acaule), Partridge Berry (Michella repens), Indian Pipe 
(Monontropa uniflora) and Indian Tobacco (lobelia inflata). The lower, more
mesic part of the stream area includes, in addition to the above species
Cucumber Magnolia (Magnolia acuminata), White Ash, Beech and Basswood (Tilia
americana), with an understory of Hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), Spice
Bush (Lindera benzoin), Redbud (Cercis canadensis) and Witch Hazel 
(Hamamelis virginiana). Poison Ivy (Rhus radicans) and Virginia Creeper (Parthenocissus
quinquefolia) are common vines. Additional species in the ground cover are
Common Speedwell (Veronica officinalis), Black Cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa)
, Jack -in-the-Pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum), Wild Geranium (Geranium
maculatum), White Snakeroot (Eupatorium rugosum), Avens (Geum sp), Tick
Trefoils (Desmodium spp), Gall -of-the-Earth (Prenanthes sp), White Wood
Aster (Aster divaricatus), Four-leaved Yam (Dioscorea quaternata), among
others. </p>
<p> Along
the middle and upper reaches on the stream banks are shrubs such as Spice Bush,
Mountain Laurel, and Mountain Rosebay (Rhododendron catawbiense). On the
forest floor is very abundant Partridge Berry and Indian Cucumberroot (Medeola
virginiana) and the northern / high elevation species Wild Sarsaparilla 
(Aralia nudicaulis), here at 1700 -1800 ft asl, are common. Here also we saw
the related American Spikenard (Aralia racemosa) as well as a few plants of
Round-leaf Violet (Viola rotundifolia) Wild Comfrey (Cynoglossum virginianum)
, Wild Licorice (Galium circaezans), Wild Nightshade (Circaea sp.). Fern species include
Christmas Fern (Polystichum acrostichoides). Ebony Spleenwort (Asplenium
platyneuron) and Marginal Shield Fern (Dryopteris marginalis) s.</p>
<p> Growing
from the moss -covered rocks of the stream bed are patches of Partridge Berry,
Miterwort (Mitella diphylla), Bedstraw
 (Galium sp.), Clearweed (probably Pilea pumila), Sedges (Carex spp.) and the Small Green Wood Orchid
 (Habenaria clavallata) (in bloom). In one place a little Pennsylvania
Bittercress (Cardamine pensylvanicum) was found, although not thriving in
these acid waters. An unidentified dicot (8-24-94 : This was Samolis
parviflorus) was also observed at this location.</p>
<p> The
vicinity of the stream source springs is rich in ferns including New York Fern
 (Thelypteris nova boracensis), Beech
Fern (T. hexagonoptera), Hay-scented Fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula), 
Cinnamon Fern (Osmunda cinnamomea) and Goldie's Shield Fern (Dryopteris
goldiana). Flowering plants include White Snakeroot, Jewelweed and sedges 
(Carex spp.), as well as mosses and liverworts.</p>
<p> The
presence of Butternut (Juglans cinerea) was again confirmed along Forest Road
1676 in the project area.</p>
<p>On the 24th of Aug., 1994 Hoagie and I went to Clayton
Mill Spring, she to paint, I to botanize. We ascended the third branch of
Clayton Mill Creek, which flows from the Northwest just upstream from the
diversion branch.As the first branch discussed previously, the streamside
forest here is dominated by Tuliptree, Hemlock, Black Birch and Northern Red
Oak and Red Maple. There appears to be less White Pine however. Seedlings of
White Ash were noted. The area seems a bit less acid than the first branch.
Spice Bush is very abundant and a patch of Paw Paw was noted. Witch Hazel is
also abundant and one Black Haw Viburnum was noted. There is some Flowering
Dogwood, a little Mtn. Laurel and no Rhododendron. A few Beech and Pignuts were
seen. Only one small plant of a Vaccinium was noted and the upland forest is
free of ericaceous shrubs by and large. The stream rocks are heavily covered
with mosses, which have flowering plants and ferns growing through them. One
rock a foot in dimension had a heavy growth of mosses, with Clearweed,
Partridge Berry, Viola sp., Galium triflorum, Mitella diphylla and Christmas
Fern. Partridge Berry is very abundant, especially under Hemlocks, whic appear
suffering from some disease (but not Adelgid). Clearweed is very abundant in
all moist spots, as is Galium triflorum and other bedstraws, but Mitella is
less abundant compared with the first branch; and only a few Habenaria
clavellata were seen on stream rocks. Laportia canadensis is quite common.
Aralia nudicaulis, Spotted Wintergreen and Goodyera pubescens are all unusually
abundant along the dryer areas. Virginia Creeper is common and there is some
Poison Ivy as distnguished from the first branch. Smilax sp. is scattered about but sparce.
Other herbs include Four- leaved yam, Pink Ladyslipper, a few Black Cohosh,
probably Cimicifuga racemosa. Aster divaricatus increases downstream where it's
more mesic. There are also a few small patches of Pennsylvania Watercress 
(Cardamine pensylvanicum) on the stream rocks, and here again a single plant of
Water Pimpernel (Samolus parviflorus) in bloom-as in the first branch.
Samolus parviflorus is an unusual species here since it also occurs in brackish
waters as well as in the mountains. Indian Cucumberroot is common but not as in
the first branch. Also possdible Carex conjuncta was noted.</p>
<p> Ferns
are abundant and diverse here. Most
widespread is Christmas Fern, although nt as abundant as New York Fern. Others
are Hay-scented Fern, Beech Fern (Thelypteris hexagonoptera), Dryopteris
spinulosa, Lady fern (Athyrium asplenoides), Interrupted Fern and a single Rattlesnake Fern (Botrychium
virginianum). </p>
<p> We also
saw a high-flying raptor, heard Pileated Woodpeckers, and I saw one small brown
salamander scurry across the damp leaves. One apparently viable Gypsy Moth egg
mas was seen. I also saw a hatch of small May Flies high above the bushes along
the spring. The weather was perfect for our efforts with pleasant cool, dry air
and partly sunny skies.</p>
 

<h3>Bald Knob (Proposed SIA) </h3>
<p>SW Aspect 
(Elevation 4225' asl) </p>
<p>+ Falling Springs Falls</p>
 
<p>On Aug. 28, 1994 
Mike Jones and I visited Bald Knob, hiking to the top from the junction
with State Road 703, the Airport access. The general aspect is of a stunted
Northern Red Oak - pine heath. At the junction, where we parked our truck at
~3898' asl, we saw a single Tuliptree, the only one we saw on the entire
mountain. Other trees are Northern Red Oak, Black Birch, Pitch Pine, Black
Locust, Mountain Ash, Fire Cherry, Striped Maple. Shrubs are Witch Hazel, Bear Oak, Aronia
melanocarpa, Mountain Laurel, Rhododendron catawbiense and various blueberries
 (Vaccinium pallidum ?). The land is very rocky with large blocks of quartzite.
Is the abundance of R. catawbiense here correlated with the rockiness ? At the
area of the road junction there is a beautiful unidentified goldenrod with a
dark purple- brown angular stem, glaberous; also much Sweet Fern, some White
Snakeroot, Teaberry, Trailing Arbutus. a little stunted Spotted Wintergreen.
There are some American Chestnut sprouts and Bracken Fern. Stunted Sassafras is
common- indeed to the highest elevations of 4225' asl. No Black Gum seen. Witch
Hazel seems to thrive here ! -as does Bear Oak, some of which are 6&quot;
thick. Along the road to the electronic tower on top, the most common
herbaceous species are Whorled Loosestrife and Souther Bellflower (Capanula
divaricata). Blackberries of unidentified species are common and there are a
few Coreopsis major, stunted Black Oak and White Oak sprouts. Other species are
Plume Lily, Convallaria montana, Aster macrophyllus, Hieracium paniculatum,
Prenanthes serpentaria, Melampyrum lineare and Menziesia pilosa. About half way
to the top Aster acuminatus and a little farther on, Aralia nudicaulis
appeared. Other species noted here in addition to those listed below are
Gillenia trifoliata, Ribes rotundifolia, Black Cherry, Black Huckleberry,
Hazelnut (sp?), Red Maple, Wil;d Raisin, Hay-scented Fern, Maple-leaf
Viburnum. serviceberry (sp?), Spreading Dogbane (in bloom), Virginia Creeper,
hawthorn (sp?), Smilax rotundifolia, Lactuca canadensis, Upland Willow (one
bush). A little Lycopodium flabelliforme ? was noted in several places. there are a few, probably planted, spruce on
top. No poison Ivy was seen. Noted an azalea, perhaps R. roseum (pubescent
under leaves) along top. In one place there is a small grove of Beech. The
stunted forest on top consists of Northern Red Oak (dominant), Bear Oak,
Witch Hazel, Mountain Holly (Ilex montana), Menzisia, Mountain Ash, Wild
Raisin, Catawba Rhododendron, Mountain Laurel,blackberries, Striped Maple,
Black Birch, a little Yellow Birch. A bush of Lyonia ligustrina (?) was also
seen. A large purple-stemmed umbelliferous plant with inflated petioles, 
perhaps Angelica triquinta, is common along the road. In the forest, underneath
the low stunted trees, Maianthemum cavnadense, Convallaria, Aster acuminatus,
Aralia nudicaulis, Teaberry and Hay -scented Fern grow among moss and lichen-
coverd quartzite blocks. Farther on, on a slightly northern aspect, Polypodium
virginianum is very abundant in the forest. 
There are also clumps of a dark green [?] grass with tall culms,
possibly Deschampsia flexuosa. Unknown species of lueberries are common, as is Black
Huckleberry. Pink Ladyslipper and aClematis (sp?) were noted. A single White
Pine and a single Virginia Pine seedling were seen. There appears to be no
Sweet Fern on top. No Partridge Berry or Potentilla were seen, but there are a number of
unidentified species of goldenrod in addition to that noted earlier.
Four-leaved Yam is also present at the highest elevations.</p>
<p> On our
way in we overshot and ended up seeing the exceptionally beautiful Falling Springs
Falls.</p>
 

<h3>Trip to Paddy Knob</h3>
 
<p>On Sept. 4, 1994 Steve Krichbaum and I made a trip to
Paddy Knob and also noted changes in the forest with elevation. Our first
station was at the junction of Route 84 and FR55 at an elevation of 3175' asl.
There we met Joe Robertson of 6248 Brewda Ct., Huntington, W Va. 25705-2406,
who was sympathetic to ourefforts and wanted information. The forest here is
rather dry oak, with White Oak, Scarlet Oak, Pignut, White Pine, Flowering
Dogwood, Mtn. Laurel, Bracken Fern. Continuing up the road toward Paddy Knob we
encountered Chestnut Oak, Am. Chestnut sprouts, Sassafras, red Maple, Flowering
Dogwood (here at ~3300' asl), Sugar Maple, Hemlock (healthy looking), 
Striped Maple,, White Oak. Chestnut Oak occurs at perhaps at least 4000' asl
here where Northern Red Oak begins to dominate. Butternut seems relatively
common at these high elevations where the soil seems to improve and more moisture
is available.</p>
<p> We
began to hike from the junction of Fr 55 and Fr 141 from a sign saying
&quot;Bird Run&quot; toward the SE into the GWNF. Here Black Cherry, Shagbark,
Sugar Maple, Northern Red Oak, White Ash, a few Black Oak, Butternut, Striped
Maple, alternate-leaved Dogwood, hawthorn sp,. Pignut, Hazelnut sp., a little
Menzisia, blackberry sp., Am. chestnut sprouts, Black Birch, Black Locust, a
little Cucumbe Magnolia occur at about 4200' asl. a Viola sp. is very common
with varegated leaves. White Snakeroot, Aster acuminatus, Cimicifuga racemosa 
(not C. americana), Potentilla canadensis (?), sedges, Indian Cucumberroot, a
little Maianthemum canadense, Galium triflorum, Hay-scented Fern, Aralia
nudicaulis, and a little Whorled Loosestrife are on the forest floor. An
azalea, either Flame or R. roseum, also occurs here. Farther down FR 141 we saw
White Basswood, manf Am. Chestnut sprouts, Red Maple, Witch Hazel and Solidago
graminifolia, Impatiens pallida;serviceberry sp., Rudbeckia hirta. We then
entered the woods to the east. This is
quite dry oak forest near the road and contains Wood Betony, Four-leaved Yam,
Covallaria montana, Aralia nudicaulis, Bracken Fern, blueberry sp., Cancerroot
 (Conopholis americana) occur here. Farther up the hill, away from the road,
moisture and/or soil nutrients increase and it becomes more mesic. Melanthium
parviflorum occurs here [also]. Collinsonia canadensis and Polygonum
virginianum are common in Northern Red Oak, Red Maple and Beech forest. Another
small pink white flowered Polygonum also occurs. Uvularia perfoliata,
Dryopteris marginalis, Maple-leaf Viburnum also occur. On the way back, along
the road, we noted Black Elderberry and Oswego Tea.</p>
<p> On the
top of Paddy Knob at 4400' asl, is a stunted forest obviously regrown from
agriculture and much degraded. It consists of much hawthorn, including
Crataegus punctata. Northern red Oak, Yellow Birch and Black Cherry are also
abundant.-Striped and Mountain Maples and Black Birch occur. Undergrowth
includes Ribes rotundifolia, Cimicifuga racemosa, Jack in the Pulpit,
Melanthium parviflorum, Jewelweed sp. An umbelliferous plant, possibly Angelica
triquinata, is common. Black Locust is common here at ~4400'asl. In the open
there are many blackberries and some hazelnuts (Corylus americana). Across
FR55, in the Monongahela Nf, the forest is a little larger. Here we saw
Interrupted Fern, one Christmas Fern, New York Fen, Hay-scented Fern, a little
Maianthemum canadense under Red Oak and Sugar Maple withHay-scented Fern, a
little Indian Cucumberroot, Galium triflorum. There under large Black Oak /, fire-scarred (?) trees
including large Northern red Oak and Black
Birch, here all at ~4300' asl.</p>
<p> We then
drove slowly back down toward Route 84. At one point we saw a beautiful Coopers
Hawk perched in roadside trees.</p>
<p> We then
hiked about 1/4 mile down FR 431 into the Monongahela. The elevation here is
~3700' asl. we noted Northern red Oak, American Basswood, Striped Maple, Black
Birch, Chestnut Oak, Red Maple, Impatiens pallida, Cucumber Magnolia, Sugar
Maple, aster macrophyllus, Mtn. Laurel, Deer Berry (with many large unripe
berries). </p>

<p> Species
not seen on this entire mountain this day were Black Gum, Teaberry, Spotted
Wintergreen and Goodyera. Sassafras seems confined to the lower slopes but we
may have missed this species. However we saw none of the colored leaves
associated with Black Gum. </p>
 
<h3>Devil's Backbone and Tea Creek</h3>
 
<p>8-25-92 Trip by
Hoagie and I to Tea Creek Campground, Mon. NF. First a stop at Devil's Backbone
east of Huntersville, W Va. on West Bank of Knapp Creek along Rt. 39 to observe
reported (by R. Hunsucker) *Taxus canadensis. The Yew is very abundant on a
very steep Tuscarora sandstone mountainside under Hemlock and Black Birch.
There is Mountain Maple, elderberry, Red Maple, Wood Nettle, a very cool mesic
site at about 2410' elevation. Some of the Yew is 5' or more high. Hydrangea
and a number of ferns were also present. The rock is in the shape of an
anticline at this point.</p>
 
<p>8-25-92 Tea Creek Campground. We found *Taxus canadensis
with berries on a steep rocky bank of Tea Creek just upstream on theleft bank
near the trail from the Canpground, elevation ~3010'. The forest consists
largely of Black and Yellow Birch, Hemlock, Sugar Maple, Beech, Black Cherry,
with some Yellow Buckeye, Cucumber and Fraser Magnolia, Northern Red Oak, Red
Maple. Northern red Oak (the only oak observed) is no more than a trace in
the area and these are saplings and seedlings. Understory is Great
Rhododendron, Witch Hazel, hawthorn on edges etc., Pin Cherry, serviceberry,
Musclewood, red Spruce*, Ilex montana,
Alternate-leaved Dogwood. Striped Maple, Black Elderberry, Red Elderberry (?).
No Tuliptrees seen (one small Tuliptree noted on 9-25-93), American
Spikenard, Partridge Berry, Oxalis montana(?) (under deep shade), White
Snakeroot, Christmas Fern, Dryopteris sp(?).</p>

 
<p>Spectacular sounds from Barred Owls last night. They
also hoot during most of the day.</p>
 
<p>8-26-92 Hoagie and I hiked into the edge of the
Cranberry Wilderness just south of the Tea Creek Campground. The forest here
appears to be about 60 yrs old with many tall, straight, single-stemmed trees.
It consists of Sugar Maple, Black Cherry, Beech, Cucumber Magnolia, Yellow
Buckeye, *Black Birch, Yellow Birch, basswood. 3020' elevation at base of steep
slope. Understory is largely Sugar Maple and Beech with some Striped Maple and
Witch Hazel. Aspect is north here.</p>
<p>Ground flora is rich with much Hepatica acutiloba,
Galium triflorum, Blue Cohosh, Black Cohosh, Viola spp., White Baneberry (one
plant of was noted). White Snakeroot is very common. I also noted Hydrophyllum
canadense (possdible). *Circaea alpina (Alpine Enchanter's Nightsdhade) 
(in bloom) was identified for the irst time by me. It grew with much Oxalis
montana (?), Dryopteris sp? and Athyrium thelypteroides ferns were noted. A broad-leaved
sedge is very abundant (Carex plantaginea?). Hoagie did some sketches. NoYew
was noted but plenty of browse evidence of deer. There appears to be a great
deal of a low but erect plant (~6&quot;) high that may be the basal leaves of
an Anemone that didn't flower or the remains of die-back after flowering. It
resembles the basal long-petioled leaves of Anemone canadensis or perhaps A.
virginiana or A. quinquefolia. The latter seem most likely. Christmas Fern is
also present.</p>
 
<h3>Cranberry
Wilderness Spruce Forest</h3>

 
<p>8-26-92 Hoagie and I drove along the &quot;Scenic
Highway&quot; to the junction with the North -South Trail into the Cranberry
Wilderness. We walked west into the Wilderness a way along the Trail. The trees
here are 99% immature Red Spruce,mostly less than a foot in diameter, with a
few mature trees. There is minor Red Maple and Yellow Birch. There is a
scattered understory of Ilex montana with scattered Mountain Ash seedlings.
Seedlings from a inch high to 3 ft. of Red Spruce are very abundant and there are
scattered Rhododendron maximum thickets (some still in bloom!), scattered
Southern Mtn. Cranberry (Vaccinium erythrocarpum) with red berries
characteristic of the species. More than 90% of the ground cover appears to be
hummocks of liverworts (bazzania trilobata ?) in a smooth dark green
moss-like blanket. Out of this rise numerous plants of Maianthemum canadense
and Oxalis montana, scattered Clintonia borealis(?) plants are still evident.
There are also scattered Menziesia pilosa plants, Indian Pipe and Partridge
Berry. Mosses (Polytrichum and Sphagnum clumps) are common. We chased up a
large flock of Ruffed Grouse and sawe where some animal (bird) had been
feeding on spruce cones. Deer droppings and other sign (browse) were common.
Cinnamon Fern was also noted.</p>
 
<p>8-27-92 Hoagie and I drove to nearby Day Run
Campground ~ mile south of this campground, at a fork in the road, we found a
large clump of Taxus, virtually pristine in the open at the forest edge.
Another clump in the forest nearby was in bad shape, appearing to have been
browsed. At thisd point the key stuck in the ignition and we decided to return
home prematurely. We had intended to visit Cranberry Glades.</p>
 
<h3>Grassy Mt.</h3>

 
<p>May 9 and 10, 1993 Trip by Steve and I to Grassy Mtn.
Opportunity Area, Monongahela Nf to meet with Dennis Hendricks at the Island
Campground in Pocahontas County, West Va.</p>
<p> On the
9th we drove up Forest Road 112 toward Spruce Knob. When we encountered stands
of secon groeth spruce we explored to
the NW of the road on discovered water starwort (either Callitriche palustris
or C. heterophylla) growing in a small stream which also contained small fish
 (non-darters) and at least one 3 inch salamander. Ground cover consisted
of Lycopods and mosses, including
Sphagnum. We noted one old Table Mtn. Pine smothered by second growth Red
Spruce.</p>
<p> We then
hiked to the SE of the road down an old timber sale road which led to a
clearcut. We noted that the forest here (Beech, Red Maple, Cherry, Yellow and
Black Birch, White Ash and Hemlock, with some small invading Spruce) had
dominant ground cover of Lycopods and Yellow Trout Lily, a Erythronium without
auricles on petal base and no reclining capsule, a condition according to
Strausbaugh and Core! It's amazing how this flower, already done blooming,
covers many square miles of deciduous forest, here at ~3900' asl. It's likely
that this was once spruce forest and hence the Lycoplds. The soil organiclayer
appears to be about 4&quot; deep above a light colored uniform mineral soil. We
also noted Maianthemum canadense in a damp area under Hemlock.</p>
 
<p>*Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove</p>
<h3>Grassy Mtn.</h3>

 
<p>On returning to the Island Campground, elevation~3000',
I as usual explored-mostly in morning of the 10th- the vicinity. Here, as
elsewhere, we noted a spectacular nodding Trillium (Hunsucker says this is T.
erectum) with deep purple petals, also in contradiction to the Strausburg -
Core book (not really). Also noted beautiful Trillium undulatum. Maianthemum
canadensw is very common as are the toothwort (D. laciniata and D. diphylla). 
In places M. canadense is intergrown with Panax trifolius. Also, there were
several anemones, Mountain and others. Veratrum viride is common. Shrubs
include Viburnumalnifolium, Witch Hazel and Mt. Laurel. Foam Flower, Partridge
Berry and Oxalis occur. The trees include Black and Yellow Birch, Sugar and Red
Maple, White Ash, Beech, Hemlock and a few Northern Red Oak. Wood Betony in
bare soil along stream. Noted considerable bird life, including small tree top
inhabitants (warblers). I identified the Red-eyed Vireo for the first time.
Chipping Sparrows foraged around our table.</p>
 
<h3>Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove</h3>
<p>May 10, 1993 We drove to the Fanny Bennett Hemlock
Grove, a ~65 acre remnant of the primary forest - very impressive along a fine
little stream. Most im[?] dead falls and ancient down trees, snags of every age
and size, many forming debris dams in the stream. The mesic forest in the
bottom is very diverse, dominated by large Hemlock with Sugar and Red Maple,
White Ash, understory of Viburnum
alnifolium (in bloom), Striped Maple. </p>
 
<h3>Grassy Mtn.</h3>

 
<p>A partial list of herbaceous species includes very
abundant Viola rotundifolia, Maianthemum canadense, Black Cohosh, Jack-in-the
-Pulpit, Foam lower, Mtn. Anemone, Christmas and other ferns. There is also
Beech and serviceberry, Black and Yellow Birch. On climbing the slope oaks and
pine increase with very large White Oaks, also Northern Red and magnificent
White Pine. Farther up there is Black Gum, Chestnut Oak and a little Pitch
Pine. The entire area is infiltrated with mostly small understory Red Spruce,
perhaps a result of an expansion of the species due to climate change or fire
suppression (here at >3000' asl ?). The stream appears to be rich in tiny
crayfish and we heard Scarlet Tanagers.</p>
 
<h3>Big Run</h3>
 
<p>We ate lunch at Big Run and then proceeded up the Run
from Highway 28. We noted great floral and avian diversity, saw a Water Snake
swimming down stream near a debris dam and several trout. The forest, here at
~2600' asl, consists largely of Black
and Yellow Birch, Red and Sugar Maple, Beech, White Ash, some Tuliptree,
Hemlock, Northern Red Oak, Basswood (species?), Magnolia (Cucumber ?),
Viburnum alnifolium and Great Rhododendron. Serviceberry and Witch Hazel are
common.. *Importantly, we suddenly encounterd an isolated patch of Canadian Yew
on a 6 ft high steep-sided cross-bedded sandstone rock about 15 ft x 15 ft in
dimension. There was evidence of deer browsing and droppings on this rock, but
the Yew is not heavily browsed. Many mesic herb species are present, including
purple nodding Trillium, Foam Flower, Miterwort, Phlox stolonifera, Dentaria
diphylla, Dutchman's Breeches (not in bloom). Maianthemum canadense is very
common and I noted an unidentified and heavily-browsed shrub (alt. with
prunus-like leaves) near the Yew rock on the trail. We also saw asnd heard the
beautiful song of the Rose-breasted Grossbeak. we also heard Scarlet Tanagers.</p>
 

<h3>Laurel Fork Wilderness and Mtn. Rendezvous</h3>
 
<p>Aug. 6, 7, 8 and 9, 1993 Trip by Steve K. and I to
Laurel Fork Campground and Laurel Fork
North and South, Beaverdam Ridge opportunity Area and Elkins, West Va.</p>
<p>We left in a pleasant rainstorm Friday
forenoon and arrived at the Campground at about 2:00 PM. Steve and I hiked a
downstream trail into the Laurel Fork Wilderness. The forest is fairly young, mostly
Yellow Birch- Sugar Maple- Beech, wiyj much Black Cherry, fair amount of
Hemlock and some Spruce and red Maple. No Black Birch? There are scattered
White Ash and a few large Cucumber Magnolia. Skunk Cabbageis very common, a is
Musclewood, Oxalis (montana ?) and Maianthemum canadense are the dominant
ground cover. There is also Hop hornbeam, serviceberry, Striped and Mtn. Maple,
and along the stream hawthorn, Speckled Alder (large), Witch Hazel. Also
noted Chrysosplenium americanum, Clearweed, Viola sp, White Snakeroot,
Impatiens capensis, Jack-in - the -Pulpit, Oswego Tea, Rubus odoratus.
Kingfishers were common along the stream and Red Squirrels were noted. Vireos
are also calling. here are planted Red
Pine at the Campground. No ericaceous vegetation was noted downstream. We
enjoyed dead ripe, very large seviceberries along the stream. This is the most
mesic forest I've seen. No oak was seen.</p>
<p> On
Aug. 7 we hiked upstream into the Laurel Fork South Wilderness. The forest is
similar to that downstream with some additions. We noted Blue Cohosh (berries), remains of a foot-tall orchid, possibly a Habenaria, Disporum ? Uvularia,
and in the low land next to a fen, much Aralia nudicaulis as shown by many
berry stalks. this wetland has many taal
herbs: Boneset, Panicum sp.?, Carex gynandra, Impatiens capensis, Cinnamon
Fern, Tearthumb, (polygonum), Solidago graminifolia (?), S. gigantia? This
appears to be an old beaver meadow. Farther on, on upland slopes, in woods
along the trail Indian Cucumberroot, Panicled Hawkweed, Wood Betony, much Skunk
Cabbage, Hemlock, Spruce, Veratrum viride, a little Rhododendron maximum.
Square-stemmed Monkeyflower was noted in
damp openings. At the base of many spruce liverwort is common. New York Fern is
very common, as are at least 3 species of Lycopods incl. L. lucidulum. Oxalis 
(montana?) is everywhere and some Maianthemum canadense. Finally we also see a
little Christmas Fern. At one place on the shores of a small pond in the open,
we found a pile of ~7 dead 6' chubs ? piled up, perhaps by a Mink! In places
there are many small spruce showing this tree making a comeback under the
Yellow Birch, Sugar Maple, Beech overstory. A little farther on there seems to
be more Cladonia. In one place, in a small seep area with Veratrum viride, we saw our first *Glade
Spurge, perhaps a dozen yard-high
clumps, which I photographed. A white fungus ? bloom was on the Glade Spurg and we could find no seed
capsules. At another opening we saw lush wild rye of unknown species. On our return we saw one clump of Viburnum
alnifolium, and in an open serep Ninebark. An avens as well as a few American
Chestnut sprouts were noted as well. Red Maple is omnipresent in small numbers.</p>
 
<h3>Beaver Dam Run to Laurel Fork</h3>
<p>Aug. 7, 1993</p>

 
<p> On
Aug. 7 afternoon we went to the Beaver Dam Opportunity Area, along Beaver Dam
Run, Steve, Dennis, Charlie, Alice and I.</p>
<p> At
the road (FR 14) we noted Spiraea alba, Ninebark, Solidago graminifolia (?), Northern
Willowherb(?) Great Willowherb, Hypericum densiflorum, Elderberry sp?, Silky Willow, bedstraw. The
Spiraea and Johnswort were in spectacular bloom. The fen, which is along Beaver
ponds on the stream, is surrounded by Red Spruce - Hemlock stands with planted
red Pine. We also saw Catbirds in the bushes. Our hike downstream, ranging from
about 3000' asl at the fen and road ended at perhaps 2800' asl at Laurel Fork.
Along the way we noted Pignut in a predominantly Black Cherry, Beech, Sugar
Maple forest with abundant mostly small Red Spruce. The ground cover is
dominantly Oxalis with some Maianthemum canadense. Mt. Holly, Rhododendron
maximum, Striped Maple. There is scattered Cucumber Magnolia and Fraser
Magnolia seedlings were noted. We heard Wood Thrush. New York Fern is very
abundant ground cover-as well as other ferns. Again Red Maple occurs frequently
in small numbers.</p>
<p> Aug.
8, 1993 Steve and I survey forest from Laurel Creek Camp to Beaverdam Run going
upstream from FRM. The forest along FRM at 3600' asl consists dominantly of
open crowned mature Sugar Maple, Beech, Cherry with scattered White Ash,
Cucumber and Fraser Magnolia and *White Basswood. There is much down wood, some
large. Understory is largely Beech with much New York Fern and White Snakeroot.
The soil, from upturned roots, appears to be mull type, or at least very good,
corresponding to the White Basswood. Most Beech leaves appear to be curled up
as if by drought. These observations were made largely in designated Laurel
Fork North Wilderness. On the other side of the road in non-wilderness, the
forest is degraded somewhat with little down wood. No Spruce or Hemlock were observed
in this forest on either side of the road. </p>
<p> When
we reached the Beaver Dam Run we hiked upstream along the southeast edge of the
wetland. We noted the following additiona shrubs: Chokecherry (with abundant
red berries), Viburnum cassinoides, Ilex montana, Ilex verticillata, a little
Mtn. Laurel, much NY Fern and some Bracken Fern, planted Red Pine. WEe hear and
saw (in air) Red-shouldered Hawk and scattered Japanese Beetles*. There
doesn't appear to be any Red Pine reproduction, although the trees here at 3000
ft asl appear healthy. red Spruce, which appears to be reproducing well, is
concentrated around the wetland - as is common, perhaps due to air drainage. I
also heard Green Frogs croaking and there were many amphibian eggs in the
Beaver ponds. Red Maple is also common. A yellow beetle about 1cm long is very
common and many Black Cherry trees are suffering from a leaf roller and in some
cases completely defoliated with browning hillsides.</p>
 
<p> Aug.
21 and 22 Steve and I meet WVHC folks at Woodlands Institute and go on field
trip along Big Run near Spruce Knob, W Va.</p>
<p> Aug.
22 Our first walk was N of the road
along western branch and along Big Run through mixed second growth northern
hardwoods (Beech, Red Maple, Birch) with Spruce and Hemlock Red Pine
plantations and open fields. Along the west branch are many beaver ponds. Flat
Top White Aster (A. umbellatus), Impatiens capensis and Silky Willow are
prominent in openings. We noted several bush honeysuckle near the roads, either
L. tataria or L. canadensis with red berries. Under the pines, spruce and
Hemlock, Oxalis montana and Maianthemum canadense and many ferns are ground
cover. Also Partridge Berry. Around Beaver ponds we noted Hypericum mutilum,
Vaccinium angustifolium, Chelone glabra, Oswego Tea, a yellow-flowering
Hypericum. I saw my first ever clump of Gaultheria hispidula on a rotting stump
 (photo taken). Noted many butterflies, mostly Fritillaries on goldenrod.
Japanese Beetles were also common. Other plants noted were Ninebark, Menziesia
 (little), Upland Willow. Ravens were calling.</p>

<p> We
then hiked south of the road along Big
Run over an old railroad grade with ties still present. This is a birch (Black
and Yellow) - Red Maple -Beech -Black Cherry - Hemlock- Red Spruce with
increasing amounts of White Aash and Northern Red Oak, Sugar Maple downstream.
There are increasing Red Oak seedlings and Beech sprouts and seedlings,
Hawthorn, Striped Maple, serviceberry and increasing Mt. Laurel downstream.
Also increasing Rhododendron along the stream. Vaccinium angustifolium is
common. Some Menziesia pilosa. ground cover of Partridge Berry, Maianthemum
canadense, Lycopods, A little Mtn. Maple and Viburnum alnifolium,
Alternate-leaf Dogwood. Other plants are Aster divaricatus, NY Fern, a little
Christmas Fern, Carrion Flower, a few patches of Goodyera. Chickadees, a large
flock of Ruffed Grouse and Leopard Frog were noted. Rocks in the gorge are
dipping fairly steeply toward the east. A high point was the discovery of
several Habenaria orbiculata orchids (gone to seed) on the trail. No
magnolias or Tuliptrees were seen. One Trillium was seen on the steep
fern-covered slope. Also Chrysosplenium americana was seen in the damp soil
along the trail. Trout (?) were noted in the stream. In oner place in an opening
what may have been Rudbeckia laciniata was abundant and spectacular. Bracken
Fern was common along the trail and in openings and Veratrum viride occurs.</p>
 
<h3>Blue Bend at Anthony Creek</h3>
 
<p> Sept.
2, 3, 4, 1993. Trip with Hoagie to the Blue Bend Campground of the Monongahela
NF' Anthony Creek cuts through Ridgely 
Sand stone upstream and may pick up carbonate.</p>
<p> We
arrived early afternoon and camped at the Blue Meadow (overflow ?) Campground.
Hoagie sketched along Anthony Creek and I botanized. The upland forest (White
Pine, Black(?) Maple, N. Red Oak, Hemlock, 
Musclewood etc.) was quite mesic. I discovered two colonmies of
Panax quinquefolius of about 4 plants
each with one mature with berries right in the Campground. Hepatica americana
and possibly H. acutiloba, are common, as is Virginia Creeper. Pileated
Woodpeckers and crows were common. There are a few small, much branched red
Spruce trees scattered about, natural-appearing but perhaps planted in the
Campground near one colony of Ginseng. Also, there are several bushes of what
may be Fly Honeysuckle (Lonicera canadensis) or the European species here.
The clearings here are ringed with natives and exotics, including Discorea
batatas (?), Populus gileadensis (?) (sticky large aromatic end buds), Black
Walnut, Hypericum prolificum, Vitis spp. etc.</p>
<p> Along
Anthony Creek a rich flood plain forest 
of Sugar Maple, Red Maple, Yellow Buckeye, Beech, Tuliptree, Hemlock,
White Pine, Rhododendron, Musclewood, much Spice Bush. This is upstream from
our camp. Along the stream I noted Cornus amomum, Ninebark, Lobelia cardinalis
and L. siphilitica (both in bloom), Aster divaricatis is everywhere abundant,
as is Hollow Joe Pye Weed, Horse Balm, Sycamore, Witch Hazel, Blue Cohosh,
Black Cohosh, Wingstem, Viola spp., Lopseed. A Sedum, probably S. ternatum, is
common ground cover in the forest. Little or no Partridge Berry under Hemlock
here. Slippery Elm, Flowering Dogwood and Northern Red Oak are common.</p>
 

<h3>Along Anthony Creek</h3>
<p>~1850 - 1900' asl</p>
<p> Virginia
Creeper, Poison Ivy, a Sanicle, Gallium spp., White Snakeroot, Canada Moonseed,
, Shagbark (practically the only Hickory), Black Locust, Am. basswood and
White Basswood, Black Cherry, Japanese Honeysuckle, Tick Trefoil (spp.), 
hawthorn, Rubus spp., Clearweed, Sweet Cicely, Four-leaved Yam, Black Gum,
Golden Ragwort and Senecio obovatus (in woods). An unknown bird calling
&quot;chep, chep, chep etc.&quot; was common, as were Pileated Woodpeckers. </p>
<p> <b>(9-3-93)</b><br>
 botanizing along Anthony Creek at and downstream from Blue Bend Campground
while Hoagie painted just below the foot bridge. The forest on the flood plain and on thelower mountain
slopes is very rich mixed mesophyte with dominating Tuliptree, Yellow Buckeye,
Sugar Maple, White Ash, Beech, Shagbark, Black Birch, Hemlock, White Pine,some
large size, although probably not old. Buckeye was dropping nuts. Both American
and White Basswood occur and Northern Red Oak is virtually the only oak,
although White Oak was noted on the slopes. Hemlock is Adelgid-free. Slippery
Elm, Black Cherry, Black Locust, Red Maple appear to be minor, while Sycamore
is abundant along Anthony Creek. Minor Striped Maple. The most common
understory tree is Musclewood with minor Hophornbeam, redbud, Flowering
Dogwood, Alternate-leaved Dogwood, Witch Hazel. The only magnolia noted was
Cucumber Magnolia. Spice Bush seemed to be everywhere and there is mior Striped Maple. The Hemlock seems free of
Adelgid here. Black Elderberry occurs in moist openings. Partridge Berry is not
common under Hemlock but occurs in very lush colonies on certain banks and
scattered locations. Instead Sedum ternatum appears to be the most pervasive
ground cover in moist, shady areas. Spotted Witergreen and Goodyera pubescens
occur in a few places. I encountered Bob Richards of Rout 3, Box 431,
Summersville, West Va., 26281, who showed me a leaf of Goodyera repens he had
collected from a downstream area along Anthony Creek. The slope facing the
stream on the stream's left side faces at first west, but then more northerly
after about a quarter mile below the foot bridge. This slope is exceedinly rich
in moisture and nutrients over thinnly bedded horizontal rock which must have a
large Ca/Mg component. There is a lot of Hydrangea, Wingstem and many other
plants and ferns. Hepatica acutiloba is very abundant, as is Solidago
flexicaulis. Much spectacular Heuchera vilosa hangs to steep rocky banks. Here
at ~1800 ft asl. In one place there is
Mt. Maple and lush Aralia nudicaulis beneath. Aralia racemosa is more common,
as is Disporum lanuginosum (with red berries). There is some Bladdernut. Ferns include
Spinulose Shield Fern, Dryopteris marginalis, NY Fern, Christmas Fern,
SensitiveFern, possible Mt. Spleenwort and spwctacular Walking Fern on damp
vertical rock outcrops. only swallowtail Butterflies were noted. Jack - the-
Pulpit is common. Laportia canadensis. Horse Balm, Lopseed etc. are common.</p>
 
<h3>Dolly Sods</h3>
 

<p> Sept.
9, 10 and 11, 1993 Trip with Hoagie to red Creek Campground of Dolly Sods in
the Monongahela Nf.</p>
<p> Swpt.
9 We left home about 10:00 AM on Thursday 9 and arrived at Dolly Sods early in
the afternoon to somewhat overcast weather. Hoagie did a watercolor from a
rocky knoll N of camp while I botanized. The area is essentially a shrub forest
with grassy and moss/ lichen openings and clumps of Red Spruce. The most common
shrubs and small trees are populus tremuloides and P. grandidentata, Striped
Maple, Red Maple, yellow Birch, Ilex montana, Nemopanthus mucronata, Alnus
rugosa, Pin Cherry, Black Cherry, serviceberry (sp), Menziesia pilosa, Bear Oak, Viburnum
casinoides, Mt. Laurel, Rhododendron maximum, Azalia sp., aronia melanocarpa, Black Locust, Witch
Hazel, Ilex verticillata (?), hawthorn (spp) and Mountain Ash. Aronia
melanocarpa, I. montana, N. mucronata are particularly common. Choke Cherry may
be present. Much Menziesia looks as if
it's in decline with many dying bushes. Low bushes consist mainly of Black
Huckleberry and a variety of blueberries, including Vaccinium angustifolium. V.
myrtilloides (?), as well as others (V. pallidum ?). I noted what appeared to
be several stunted shrubby Black Gum. Few Ribes were seen. Also few large
Rubus. Tear Thumb is common in mesic moist spots. Ground cover consists of Gaultheria
procumbens, Trailing Arbutus, and particularly of Rubus hispidus, esp. in damp
places. Vaccinium oxycoccos (?) is common wherever there is adequate moisture,
even on uplands. There is also Glade St. Johnswort in low places and scattered
Pitch Pine and Table Mt. Pine, but very little of these Pines. there is a quite
a bit of planted Red Pine but little or no reproduction. Gentiana linearis is
common in both uplands and bogs as is Aster ubellatus. This is the height of
the berry season, with heavy crops of huckleberries, blueberries. A. melanocarpa, I. montana, N. mucronata,
cranberries etc. An interesting and spctacular plant among the rocks is
Dicentra exima, some of which were still in bloom! Ferns of many types are
present, among which Bracken Fern is common, also a soft fern turning brown in
the open but still green under trees. Tear Thumb is common in open seeps.
Goldenrods are common, incl. Solidago graminifolia. Leersia oryzoides also
noted. There are 3 ft. high conical ant hills that are active. Red Squirrels
were heard. Juncos are common. In moist openings Cotton Sedge is common. Only a
very little Maianthemum canadense was noted. The rock is the widespread
conglomeratic sandstone/ quartzite weather to secondary pebbles in places.</p>
<p> Sept.
10 Very strong rain during night with strong wind and gradual clearing in
morning. Betty began an oil painting from the same rock knoll. I continued to
botanize. I paid a visit to nearby extensive acid bog of minimal extent of ~50
acres. There I chased up an Osprey which I at first thought was an eagle from
its cry. But its wing profile against the sky and pattern revealed its true
nature. This bog cosists od a layer of peat, perhaps only a few feet thick on
its edges over white gravel formed from a regional conglomeratic sandstone. It
is edged by spruce forest while abundant shrubs, mostly Nemopanthus and Alnus
rugosa, extend for a way into the bog. There are many hummocks, some up to 3
ft. high, which appear to consist of mossy peat and on which shrubs grow. Wild
raisin and Aronia melanocarpa also extend into the bog. A variety of
blueberries, among V. angustifolium,Rubus hispidus and Small Cranberry (V.
oxycoccos) (?)- or possibly Large with some Mt. Laurel are common on the bog
edge. In retrospect I think I saw Southern Mtn, Cranberry here also on 9-16-94.
Only a little Maianthemum canadence was noted. Gaultheria procumbens is common as on uplands in dryer spots. There
are also scattered Red Maple and some few contorted Pitch Pine, the latter even
out in the open bog. The bog itself is rich in mosses, including much Sphagnum,
patches of Cladonia and many small cranberry vines, many with half ripe
cranberries. In one place I encountered a rich botanical prize, Coptis
groenlandica, the first I'd ever seen outside a book. Betty, who was sketching
at the bog edge some distance away but near the road, found a large, probably
male, Black Bear watching her. The Bear left with a slight &quot;woof&quot; on
seeing her so close! The Goldthread was on thr north side of one of the
hummocks well out in the bog. In some places also there are large patches of a
robust sedge out in the bog.-from photo Carex folliculata (Hunsucker). Also
everywhere there is a low dicot plant,[ Solidago uliginosa (Hunsucker) ]in
clumps with lanceolate glaberous leaves, well toothed with edged petioles,
possibly a composite, but showing no[?] seeds. Another plant I encountered for
the first time as Chimaphila umbellata 9 possibly not ?) or at least what I
took to be this plant, two thick glossy, serrated leaves on a woody stem with a
prominent winter bud (photo)- also on the N side of a bog hummock. Gentiana
linearis is scattered through the bog. On our way out we stopped near the fork
in the roads leading to Canaan Valley and to N Fork Valley. The elevation here
seems somewhat greater, perhaps more than 4000' asl. It is a largely Beech
forest with Yellow Birch, Black Cherry and Striped Maple. Clearweed was lush in
the woods roads. Just before we arrived there a beautiflul crow-sized Coopers
Hawh flew up and perched right at the edge of the road in the dense forest
edge. The forest here has little ground cover but Oxalis was noted. Tear Thumb
was also noted.</p>
 
<h3>Cranberry Glades</h3>
 
<p> Sept.
25 and 26, 1993 Mike Jones and I went to the Cranberry Botanical Area (Glades).</p>

<p> We
noted the following additions to Core's tabulation of plants: Lindera benzoin,
Impatiens (sp?), Smilax rotundifolia, Populus tremuloides, Maianthemum
canadense, Laportia canadensis. The Impatiens seemed very scrawny. Also note
Tilia americana. There also is a very long stemmed holly with stens of berries
at least 1.5 cm long. This may be Ilex colina. In the open glade Hypericum
virginicum is common and spectacular with its red seed capsules that resemble
flower buds. I also heard a Red-shouldered Hawk.Rain was quite heavy on the 25.
We left home in it and it continued till early evening, but stopped while we
cooked our meal at the Tea Creek Campground. Additional plants noted at Tea
Creek were Rubus canadensis (Thornless Blackberry), one small Tuliptree, here
at 3000' asl and a type of Bush Honeysuckle, possibly Lonicera canadensis from
its hairy leaves. I also showed Mike the Taxus canadensis upstream along Tea Creek.
We had some good hikes on the 26 since it cleared and identified Crataegus
punctata. However, no really rare or unusual plants we hadn't seen before were
encountered. </p>
 
<h3>Spruce Knob Trip</h3>
<p>Allegheny Mtn and
Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove</p>
 
<p>June 18 and 19, 1994 Mike Jones and I went to
a meeting of the W. Va. Environmental Council at Woodlands Mtn. Institute and
botanized on Spruce Knob. We also stopped on Allegheny Mtn on the state line to
observe the vegetation. We also stopped at Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove.</p>
<p> We
stopped at the highest point of RT 250 on Allegeny Mtn West Virginia line at
4336 ft asl. Northern Red Oak, Sugar Maple, YellowBirch, White Ash and Black
Locust occur in about that order. Striped and Mtn Maples are understory
species. Aralia nudicaulis, White Snakeroot, Columbine and Dutchman's Pipe Vine
were noted.</p>
<p> On
our way we stopped along Rt 250 near (East) of the junction with Rt 28. In a
small ponded area along 250 we noted a considerable number of Wood Ducks.</p>

<p> On
our way we stopped at the Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove noting again the species.
Hemlock, Sugar Maple, Black Birch, Northern Red Oak, Beech, Red Spruce, White
Ash, Striped Maple, Black Elderberry, Viburnum alnifolium. Viola rotundifolia,
Partridge Berry are the most common ground cover. Veronica officinalis,
Jewelweed ap?, Miterwort and Foam Flower areall common, as is Sedum ternatum.
Christmas Fern, Dryopteris spinulosa, Bazzania as well as manymosses. The Red
Spruce noted were all small but larger ones may be present. Scarlet Tanagers
were heard.</p>
 
<h3>Woodlands Mtn Institute</h3>
<p>June 18 and 19
continued</p>
 
<p> We
hiked in the woods at the Institute grounds at about 4100 ft asl. Here the
forest consists dominantly of Sugar Maple, red Maple, Yellow Birch, Beech,
American Basswood, Black Cherry, Black Birch. Hophornbeam, hawthorn, Striped
Maple occur as understory. There are substantial groves of fairly large Red
Spruce. Maianthemum canadense, Veratrum veride, Oxalis montana, Lycopodium
flabelliforme, L. obscurum, Cladonia, Viola sp., Jack-in-the -Pulpit as well as
the seed stalks of Ramp were noted. We
also saw just the two basal leaves of Habenaria orbiculata, and along a small stream,
Saxifraga micranthidifolia. Hermit Thrushes were heard. Athyrium filix-femina
was identified for the above forest later. A beautiful moth was photographed.</p>
<p> That
evening we camped in a field under a large White Ash and heard Peepers call.
Here I also noted a single Cucumber Magnolia at about 4100' asl.</p>
<p> Hawthorn
and Vaccinium angustifolium arevery common in pastures and openings. The
hawthorn has leaves like Crataegus punctata.</p>
 
<h3>Spruce Knob</h3>
 
<p> June
19, 1994 We drove up to Spruce Knob. We
explored along the SE face at about 4500' asl. Forest here consists of Red Oak (Northern), Yellow Birch, Sugar Maple, Black Cherry, Beech, White Ash
and Red Spruce with Striped Maple, hawthorn understory. Along the road we noted
Red Elderberry, Mountain Maple, Mountain Ash and Skunk Current. Ground cover in the woods is very rich in
Aster acuminatus, Botrichium virginianum, Hay-scented Fern and other ferns.
Other plants are White Snakeroot, Aralia nudicaulis, Jack-in-the- Pulpit,
Carrion Flower, a Thalictrum sp., Hairy (?) Sweet Cicely, Dicentra exima,
Veratrum veride, Oxalis montana, Dryopteris spinulosa, Prenanthes sp.,
Jewelweed, Blue Cohosh, Black Cohosh (sp.?), Alternate-leaved Dogwood, Ranunculus recurvata and R. abortivus. Along
the road we noted a large Cow Parsnip, Columbine, Here we also saw 2
Zebra-sriped grasshoppers and we heard Scarlet Tanagers. Carex gynandra was
present in seeps in the woods.</p>
<p> We
then drove to the top (4700' asl -4800' asl) where we noted Menziesia pilosa,
Maianthemum canadense, Southern Mtn. Cranberry, Eupatorium maculatum, Oxalis
montana (in full bloom compared to past bloom lower), Rhododendron roseum,
Vaccinium angustifolium, Vaccinium pallidum (?), Cornus canadensis, Shining
Clubmoss, Wild Raisin, Red Maple, serviceberry, Trillium sp., Clintonia sp.,
Fire Cherry, Red Spruce, Salix sericia
?, Cinnamon Fern, Polygonum cilinode, Nemopanthus mucronatus, Trientalis
borealis (from photo), Mtn. Ash,</p>
<p> We
heard Veeries singing and saw what could only have been Red Crossbills or
Purple Finch singin on the very top of 
Re Spruce trees. These were two males, clearly in conflict and the red
of their feathers was clearly visible. I may also have seen a large accipiter
(Goshawk ?) fly low over trees. Thunderstorms were all around but little or no
rain fell.</p>

 
<h3>Trip to Smoke Hole</h3>
 
<p> On
Sept. 6 and 7, 1994 Steve Krichbaum and I 
went to the Smoke Hole area of the Monongahela NF to meet R. Hunsucker
and see Cedar Glades etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
