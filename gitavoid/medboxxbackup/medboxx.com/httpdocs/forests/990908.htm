It's certainly never felt like either winter or summer. I feel as though I've been cheated of those seasons.  <br><dd>All today, I was amazed by how few user complaints we received concerning the new web page builder we released last night.  It just didn't feel finished to me at the time, but I guess my team (and our outsource partners) had actually done a pretty damn good job.  Perhaps (and this is intended as a gratuitous outburst) there <i>is</i> justice in the world.<dd><dd>At around noon I rode my bike down the San Diego River's north bank path to the vicinity of the Mission Valley Staples. Just east of Mission Center Road, this path flanks a condo development through a remarkably shady patch of woods.  There are remote spots here and there off the path, places secluded enough to leisurely smoke pot (I should know).  But the benches are perfectly visible from the path.  That's why I was surprised today when I came upon a middle aged couple sitting on the benches doing something one normally reserves for the bedroom or late nights on the living room couch.  One of them, a guy, was sitting passively while the other was seated beside him with her (or his) head in his lap.  As I rode away, I found myself pondering the contortionism that must have been taking place.  Perhaps the fellator's head was actually detached from his or her body!<p><dd>The other day I had an interesting experience with nonverbal human nature. I was thinking of a hilarious joke as I walked between the office buildings of my office park.  Just then, I happened to notice a particularly beautiful African American woman walking in front of me.  For some reason she turned around and when she caught my eye, I had a big sincere smile on my face. It forced her not only to do a double take, but also to return the most flattering smile I received that day.</blockquote></font><p><center><font size=-1 face=arial><a href="feedback.php?subject=head+along+the+river">send me mail</a><br><a href=990907.htm>previous</a> |<! href=990909.htm>next</a></center></font></body></html>
