Today, despite all the odds, I actually managed to launch an extremely flexible SQL-driven contest system onto the live site, but I had no time to savour this accomplishment.  Next thing I knew, the Grand Pooh Bah had called the four most successful programmers (myself included) into a back room to propose a plan that he billed (in his characteristically visionary style) as "the future of democracy."  That sounded cool to me, and before I knew it I found myself (along with Eric the Web Developer) as a co-developer of this H. Ross Perotesque electronic democracy system.  You wouldn't believe the lavish bonuses being dangled in front of this thing.  But if it flies, it will be, I'm told,  a real ground-breaking accomplishment. <br><dd>Despite myself, I'm having difficulty being cynical about this project.  For once, (with the exception of the compressed schedule) it's actually being approached in logical fashion. For example, we two programmers were actually brought in to a meeting today to help plan the initial high-level strategy of the project.  That's got to be some sort of first for this company, where developers don't usually find out they're even on a project until the planning phase is complete.<p><dd>In a somewhat related vein, Eric the Web Developer has referred one of his after-hours web development clients to me to do a little stuff on the side. For some reason I agreed to this additional work.<br><dd> Then comes an email from my Dad demanding that I get cracking on putting two of his biological field surveys up on the web.<br><dd>In view of these demands, time has become a precious commodity once again. When Kim and Steph went out to sushi for dinner, I rejoiced to have this evening alone just so I could get my shit done.  But the shit+keeps+stacking+up. <p><center><img src="costume.jpg" width=363 height=350 border="0"><font size=-1 color=999999><br>This photo was sent to me either by Matt Rogers or his father as a suggestion for a Halloween costume.
