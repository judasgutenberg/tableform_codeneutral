That was back during the code freeze and it's immediate aftermath.  I felt unnecessary and underutilized, and my spirit was diminished.  I thought about quitting more than I've ever thought about suicide.<br><dd>A week ago, I suddenly found all sorts of purposes where I could apply myself successfully.  My workplace satisfaction reached some sort of all-time high.  The amount of work I accomplished in a reasonable workday was phenomenal.<br><dd>But this week, we've swung too far.  Suddenly I'm deluged with a backlog of things in need of doing "yesterday." It's demoralizing.  I work hard and get a lot done, but it's like the breathing of a drowning man.  It's not healthy and it cannot persist.  Indeed, I found myself thinking about quitting again.  Suddenly, out of nowhere, I'm the master of contests.  I can put together a complex web-based voting-based contest system, front end to back end, in a single day.  I can make a "hidden Jack-O'lantern" contest in similar time.  But there's something bleak and empty about the work. It's so clear to me that I'm simply building traps to separate unwary people from their money.  I never wanted to grow up to do that back when I was a kid.<p><p></blockquote></font><p><center><font size=-1 color=666666 face=arial><a href="feedback.php?subject=to+and+fro">send me mail</a><br><a href=991020.htm>previous</a> |<! href=991022.htm>next</a></center></font></body></html>
