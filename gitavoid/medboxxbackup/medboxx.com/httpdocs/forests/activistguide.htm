<p>The following article was first
published in the Fall, 1994 issue of <i>Wild Earth</i> ( <i>4</i>, (3), 37 - 49) . However, virtually
all descriptions of conditions in the article are still as pertinent as when
they were first written. Where changes have occurred or corrections made, they
are generally indicated by brackets. It should also be noted that our case
against the US Forest Service - still as strong as ever - and the role and need for our Project, are
here documented in some detail.

</ul><h2>Abstract</h2><ul>
 An
on-the-ground and literature survey of the Central Appalachian forests is
presented from the perspective of an activist. Ecological characteristics of
forests and associated vegetation types are discussed in terms of geologic
setting, climatic zonation and variation with time, shade tolerance, and
disturbance regimes. New site - specific observations and interpretations of
rare and disjunct plant communities, fire history, succession, and regeneration
are included. Silvicultural and wildlife management practices, particularly of
the US Forest Service, are evaluated in terms of the observed ecological
characteristics.
</ul><h2>Introduction</h2><ul>
<p><b> </b>The
Central Appalachians are a meeting ground of opposites, of cold - loving
northern floras and plants with origins in the deep south, of sublime mountain
expanses marred by garish developments. Taking a page from Vice President Al
Gore's book, we may say that these are mountains in the balance, but it is a balance
precariously unstable in an ecological sense.
<p> Our
struggle to protect and restore Appalachian ecosystems resolves into a
confrontation between a growing body of knowledge in the field of conservation
biology, and the resistance, if not downright hostility, of land management
agencies to this knowledge. These agencies, led by the US Forest Service,
operate as sources of deceit and pseudo - science, refusing to break with the
special interests they have so long favored.
<p> Details are
important here, and we need to know the ecosystems well in order to save them.
Noss (1992a) stated that, &quot;No substitute exists for detailed on - the -
ground knowledge of the ecology and natural history of the region.&quot; We
need to study the biologic communities and apply this knowledge to scoping
notices, environmental assessments, and other project and program level
planning documents. In many cases citizens will find it easy to &quot;get
ahead&quot; of experts employed by the agencies in knowledge of the biologic
communities and the latest theories.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h2>THE FOREST</h2><ul>
<p> 
<h3>Geologic Setting</h3>
<ul>
<p>The
Central Appalachians consist of linear ridges and valleys, deeply dissected
plateaus, bold escarpments, wet and dry glades and numerous other landforms
that defy easy classification. They form parts of four geomorphic (landform) 
provinces and reflect a long geologic history (Press and Siever 1985 ;
Dietrich 1970) . Their oldest rocks are 600 million to 1.8 billion - year - old
crystalline granites, gneisses and metamorphosed volcanics of the eastern Blue
Ridge. Faults separate the Blue Ridge from the slightly younger rocks of
similar nature in the Piedmont Province. By contrast the western Blue Ridge is
largely composed of far younger (500 to 600 million - year - old) rocks of
the Cambrian Period, which are dominantly quartzites of sedimentary origin as well as other sediments and volcanics.
These sediments are part of the eastern exposed edge and oldest members of a
thick sequence of limestones, dolomites, shales and sandstones of the Paleozoic
Era which form the adjacent Valley and Ridge Province. They are the roots of
fold mountains and form the long, roughly parallel ridges and valleys that
characterize this province. They are also the products of stream erosion which has left the ridge tops
capped by resistant sandstones and quartzites and the valleys underlain by less
resistant shales and limestones. Immediately to the west of the Valley and
Ridge the folds become less pronounced and the major escarpment of the
Cumberland and Allegheny Front marks the eastern edge of the flat - lying and
only slightly folded rock of the Appalachian Mountain and Plateau Province (
Fenneman 1938) . 
<p>These landforms have a direct
bearing on the nature and distribution of the various forest and other
vegetation types. The eastern Blue Ridge, with its variety of nutrient - rich
igneous and metamorphic rocks, is more hospitable to plant growth than is the
western Blue Ridge and most of the Valley and Ridge. The latter province,
except for certain areas such as limestone valleys, has nutrient deficient
sandstones and quartzites or shales which yield subsoils less amenable to
moisture circulation and root penetration. The dry, stony and frequently
leached and acid (podsol) soils of these mountains favor xeric oak and pine
forests with ericaceous shrubs and ground cover, whereas the better soils favor
more mesic forests. Water storage capacity of many Central Appalachian soils is
severely restricted due to high rock content (Armson1979) . This not only
leads to xeric conditions but promotes rapid water runoff and consequent flash
flooding and bank erosion as part of the normal hydrologic regime in this
region.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>Climate</h3><ul>
<p> As
important as geology are the factors of moisture, temperature and cloud
distribution. There is a fairly strong orographic effect in the Central
Appalachians: most precipitation falls on the western slopes of the plateau,
the Valley and Ridge receives far less. The average yearly precipitation at
Pickens, West Virginia, on the western Allegheny Plateau, exceeds 60 inches (
152 cm) while Moorefield, West Virginia, 80 miles (130 km) to the northeast,
in the Valley and Ridge, gets only 25 inches (64 cm) (Strausbaugh and Core
1977) . However, precipitation increases again in the east of the Great Valley
of Virginia with a sharp peak of 50 inches (127 cm) over the Blue Ridge
(Hayden1979).
<p> Temperature
variations in the Central Appalachians have three major components which affect
forest type: latitude, elevation, and continentality. Latitudinal variation is
expressed in the geographic limitations of northern and southern species
ranges. For example the southern limit of Black Spruce is in central
Pennsylvania's Valley and Ridge while the Southern Appalachian plant Galax (<i>Galax aphylla</i>) ranges only as far north as
Preston County, West Virginia and western Maryland. Elevation counters
latitude, causing isotherms to loop southward along the mountains. On daily
weather maps this loop often extends 150 miles (240 km) or more south in the
Central Appalachians. This decrease in temperature with elevation (lapse rate
) is approximately 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit per 1000 feet (6.4 degrees Celsius
per 1000 meters), and mean temperatures may vary at least three times this F
value as a function of elevation. However the lowest temperatures are usually
attained in high mountain valleys where cold air drains down from the peaks and
collects, Continentality, or distance from the ocean, tends to align the
isotherms parallel to the coast with the lowest winter and highest summer
temperatures farthest from the water. The interplay of elevation, topography
and continentality gives a fine structure to the effect of latitude so that
many northern species are confined to selected high elevation sites or local
low elevation &quot;frost pockets&quot; with the result that the Central
Appalachians are rich in species at their extreme southern limits.
<p> Bearing
some relation to precipitation, but partly independent of it, is cloud cover.
Cloud cover is important because it affects photosynthesis, air and soil
moisture and temperature. The Allegheny Mountains are the locus of a remarkable
cloudy day maximum of more than 160 days per year compared to 120 days or less
immediately to the southeast in the Valley and Ridge and Piedmont (Reifsnyder and
Lull 1965) . This variation in cloudiness may be the defining characteristic of
the Central Appalachians since the variation in forest type corresponds more
closely to it than to rainfall. The distribution of cloudiness is consistent
with the dominance of shade tolerant and other mesophytic species in the
Alleghenies as contrasted with the less tolerant and xeric species that
dominate the sunnier forests to the southeast. The relatively cool summer
climate of the cloudy Allegheny Highlands and the western Appalachians in
general favors cold climate species that would not ordinarily be associated
with the relatively mild winter temperatures of these mountains. 
<p> Precipitation,
cloud cover and temperature in the Central Appalachians have probably all differed
from their present distributions much of the time during the last 18,000 years
since the ice sheets were at their maximum southward advance in northern
Pennsylvania and central Ohio. Pollen data (Delcourt and Delcourt 1981) 
indicate that around the glacial maximum a boreal Jack Pine / spruce parkland (
as distinguished from a closed canopy forest) extended as far south as
Tennessee, and tundra probably occupied the highest Appalachian elevations. At
that time deciduous forest of the types now covering these mountains lay far to
the south along the Gulf and lower Atlantic coastal plains, with the mixed
mesophytic component probably confined to dissected major river system
blufflands. However, even before the ice sheet reached its points of greatest advance,
a warming trend set in. When the temperature reached a maximum (the
hypsithermal interval) some 7000 years ago, existing forest types were
temporarily displaced northward perhaps 200 miles (300 km) and to several
hundred meters higher elevation. Similar displacements of this type probably
have occurred a number of times in the last 10,000 years (Pielou 1991) . Thus
there emerges a picture of a geographically dynamic forest that was able to
migrate hundreds of miles and reconstitute itself on a time scale of several
thousand years or less.
<p> As is well
known, the end of the last glacial ice advance (Wisconsinan) was succeeded by
great megafaunal extinctions. It is also inferred that in the Appalachians there was a transition from a complex
habitat mosaic (plaid pattern) of open parklands to a simpler habitat of
closed canopy forest. Guthrie (1984) speculated that the megafaunal extinction
episode with associated loss of floral diversity was related to the onset of
greater continentality and a less equable climate than the previous
interglacials. This latest interglacial has also seen the end of the apparently
worldwide coexistence of cold and warm climate species usually described as
&quot;disharmonious.&quot; Remnant communities of mixed cold and warm adapted
species are still fairly common in the Central Appalachians and may be a sort
of microcosm of Pleistocene diversity.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>Soil and Forest Types</h3><ul>
<p> As was
emphasized by Lucy Braun (1950), the most widely recognized authority on
Appalachian forests, there is a strong relation between topography, soil and
forest type. The Central Appalachians are the locus of a salient of acid and
leached podzol soils that extends down from the boreal region of Canada where
these soils are widespread and associated with coniferous forests. In the
Appalachians they grade into other shallow, rocky soil types common to many
mountain regions. However, there also are substantial areas of gray - brown
forest soils that culminate in the rich mull and melanized types characteristic
of our most diverse forests, the mixed mesophytes. By contrast the rocky and
acid podzols favor coniferous, xeric oak - chestnut, or oak - pine forests.
Conifers generally prevail on cold plateaus; the latter two types generally
prevail on dry sandstone ridges. Although the better soils once covered
extensive mountain slopes, as in the Cumberlands and Alleghenies, continued
logging, fires and poor agricultural practices have degraded the entire region
to the extent that such soils are now largely confined to topographic
concavities such as coves and riparian zones. This condition is particularly
characteristic of the Valley and Ridge Province where precipitation is low, and
dry rocky ridges are the norm.
<p> The most
complex forest and presumed parent forest of the Central Appalachians is the
mixed mesophytic. This type derived from similar forests that occupied eastern
North America and other centers such as Europe and East Asia in Tertiary times
 (Braun 1950), although subject to climate - induced migrations. Many species
of the European forests were eliminated when ice sheets forced them against
inhospitable east - west mountain ranges and seas. However, those of East Asia
survived and many close relatives of eastern North American species still live
there. The mixed mesophyte forest shows its most characteristic development in
the Cumberland Mountains and in the Alleghenies of west Virginia below 2500
feet (760 meters) asl. It extends northward with attenuated diversity into
Maryland, Pennsylvania and Ohio where it is increasingly confined to stream
valleys. Eastward in Virginia it is largely restricted to topographic
concavities such as coves, ravines and riparian zones, usually of the latest
erosion cycle (Braun 1950) .
<p> The mixed
mesophytic forest is diverse with a number of species each of magnolias, oaks,
hickories, walnuts, elms, birches, ashes, maples, basswoods, locusts and pines.
There is also Tuliptree, Black and Sweet Gum, Black Cherry, American Beech and
Canadian Hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>) 
[ also known as Eastern Hemlock, but the latter common name doesn't as clearly
distinguish it from the Carolina Hemlock ]. The most characteristic type
indicators are White Basswood and Yellow Buckeye. However Yellow Buckeye does
not generally occur in the Valley and Ridge. American Chestnut, once a major
component, now survives only as stunted, disease - ridden sprouts. These major
canopy species are accompanied by even more diverse understory tree, shrub and
herbaceous layers as well as many fungi and mosses. Typical components of the
understory are the small trees Musclewood (<i>Carpinus caroliniana</i>) and Sourwood (<i>Oxydendrum arboreum</i>), shrubs such as Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>) and Paw Paw (<i>Asimina triloba</i>) and the herbs Ginseng (<i>Panax quinquefolium</i>) and Goldenseal (<i>Hydrastis</i> <i>canadensis</i>) . Mesophytic plants,
including the trees, tend to have soft, juicy leaves that on death rapidly
decompose and, as distinguished from those of xeric oak forests, form only
light liter but contribute to building rich soils.
<p> Coinciding
roughly with the Virginia - West Virginia boundary, the eastern edge of the
mixed mesophyte region forms a broad ecotone of transition to the oak -
chestnut forest type of the Valley and Ridge. With the temporary (hopefully)
decline of the American Chestnut, which once flourished on its dry ridges, the
oak - chestnut region is now characterized by the dominance of five oaks -
Black, Scarlet, Northern Red, White and Chestnut - and on the driest sites, by
Virginia, Pitch, Shortleaf and Table Mountain Pines. Other prominent species
are White Pine, Black gum, Black Birch, Pignut Hickory and Red maple. The
understory tree layer is usually dominated by Serviceberry, Flowering Dogwood
and White Pine and in the shrub and ground layers by Mountain Laurel,
Fetterbush, huckleberries, blueberries, azaleas (deciduous rhododendrons), 
Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>
) and other acid loving plants. Slope concavities may contain Tuliptree, White
Ash, Cucumber Magnolia, Basswood and other mesic species.
<p> Still
farther to the east a second ecotone marks the transition to the oak - pine
forest of the Piedmont. Since the Piedmont generally lies below 1000 feet (300
meters) asl, it contains a number of species such as Loblolly Pine, Sweet Gum
and Southern Red Oak not found at higher elevations.
<p> On ascent
to the highest elevations and northward into Maryland, Pennsylvania and Ohio,
southern species in the mixed mesophyte forest gradually drop out; northern
species such as Yellow Birch and Mountain Maple (<i>Acer spicatum</i>) appear and Sugar Maple,
American Beech and Canadian Hemlock assume dominance. American Basswood
replaces White Basswood. This is the hemlock - White Pine - northern hardwood
forest of Braun (1950). It has a distinctly northern quality in its shrubs and
herbaceous flora and may appear identical to forests of the Adirondack
foothills or New England. However it frequently contains traces of typically southern and Central
Appalachian species such as Cucumber Magnolia, Frazer Magnolia and Black Locust
giving it greater diversity. In some places Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) forms heavy understory
thickets, a feature uncharacteristic of the northern forest.
<p> Above 3500
feet (1000 meters) in West Virginia and at lower elevations in Maryland and
Pennsylvania, the northern hardwoods yield gradually to Red Spruce montane
forest of boreal appearance. In this forest, circumpolar flowering plants such
as Mountain Oxalis (<i>Oxalis montana</i>
) and Goldthread (<i>Coptis 
groenlandica</i>) vie with lycopods, liverworts and mosses in the
ground cover while shrubs are rare because of dense shade. Southward this
forest type occurs only in a few isolated and climate - modified stands as at
Mountain Lake Wilderness and Beartown Wilderness in the Valley and Ridge and in
the Balsam Range in the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area of the Jefferson
National Forest. At Mountain Lake is a small isolated stand of old growth
consisting of Red Spruce, Hemlock, Sugar and Red Maple, Black and Yellow Birch,
White Ash, Northern Red and White Oak, Black Cherry, Cucumber Magnolia and
Tuliptree. Mountain Maple and rhododendron form the understory, and ground
cover contains intergrowths of the boreal species <i>Maianthemum canadense</i> and the Southern Appalachian <i>Galax aphylla</i>, all at about 3600 feet asl. In
the Balsam Range this forest, which
here is mostly restricted at elevations above 5000 feet (1500 m), assumes the
character of the southern spruce - fir type with the accompaniment of Red
Spruce by Fraser Fir, the Southern Appalachian endemic. Even the most northern
appearing Central Appalachian spruce forests, as on west Virginia's Allegheny
Plateau, contain an admixture of Southern Appalachian species such as Mountain
Holly (<i>Ilex montana</i>) and
Southern Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium 
erythrocarpum</i>) which are out of the range of boreal forests.
<p> In the oak
- chestnut type forests of the Valley and Ridge and Blue Ridge provinces, the
effects of elevation are more subtle, even cryptic. This is due in part to the
different species segregates that result from lower precipitation and / or
cloud cover and continentality as compared with the Allegheny highlands.
Effects take the form of higher temperatures and influence of the nearby ocean
on day to day weather, which tends to be somewhat erratic. In the vicinity of
latitude 38 degrees north Tuliptree generally grows below 2500 feet and
Chestnut Oak below 3500 feet asl. The mountains of the Valley and Ridge have
very little spruce montane forest. Instead &quot;orchard&quot; type Northern
Red Oak stands with gnarled, thick - trunked and widely spaced trees dominate
the highest elevations. On the most exposed peaks trees are greatly stunted and
contorted by the wind. Many show long, thick limbs growing at right angles to
the trunk as an adaptation to the weight of ice and wind stress<a href=#1 name=o1>(1)</a>. At
elevations where rocky, acid soils or other inhospitable conditions are
intensified, there are &quot;barrens&quot; of low heath shrubs, Sweet Fern (<i>Comptonia peregrina</i>) and Bear Oak (<i>Quercus ilicifolia</i>) . These shrub expanses are
punctuated by taller wind - contorted (banner) Pitch and Table Mountain
Pines, or in some cases, shrubby Hemlock. Above 3500 feet, low elevation shrubs
and herbaceous flora are replaced by such northerners as American Mountain Ash (
<i>Pyrus americana</i>), Mountain
Maple, <i>Clintonia borealis </i>and <i>Maianthemum canadense</i>, as in the Alleghenies.
Perhaps because of relatively high precipitation there, the northern Blue Ridge
is favored by a number of rare disjuncts. On it are found Virginia's only known
occurrences of Bearberry (<i>Arctostaphalos 
uva - ursi</i>) and Balsam Fir (<i>Abies balsamea</i>), the latter at its southern - most station on the
planet. It is confined to the summit regions of Hawksbill and Stonyman
Mountains, which reach 4000 feet in elevation, and is a minor component of oak
forest. It must have passed through a rather narrow thermal bottleneck during
the hypsithermal period.
<p> Changes in
vegetation with elevation are not solely due to lapse rate. The restriction of
Tuliptree below 2500 feet in the Valley and Ridge at 38 degrees N and its
occurrence above 3000 feet at the same latitude in cooler West Virginia
requires another explanation. The survival of seedlings frequently depends on
the interaction of temperature, soil and air moisture and light intensity.
Although the Valley and Ridge an Blue Ridge are less continental than the
Allegheny Plateau, their weather varies greatly from day to day. Warm spells
that activate buds are frequently followed by hard frosts and frost heaving that
damage buds and roots. These conditions are more prevalent in the Valley and
Ridge and Blue Ridge than on the Allegheny Plateau, with its greater snowfall
and cloud cover.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>Unusual Biologic Communities</h3><ul>
<p> Within the
areas of the major Central Appalachian forest types are many smaller biologic
communities with special characteristics. These communities have resulted from
geologic, topographic or climatic conditions that are unique in their details.
Most widespread are the glades or natural openings that result from such
conditions as interrupted drainage or bedrock - imposed moisture or drought
conditions. In terms of area the most common glades are the high - elevation
bogs, fens, swamps and other wetlands of the Allegheny Mountains and Plateau.
There are also many small forested wetlands, usually associated with floodplain
topography, artesian springs, perched water tables or sinkholes. Many of these
communities, both large and small, contain rare, frequently disjunct, species. An example is the famous Cranberry
Glade complex that covers 750 acres (
roughly 300 hectares) on West Virginia's Allegheny Plateau. Lying at 3400 feet
elevation, its boreal type bogs, fens, marshes and swamps are rich in acid soil
disjuncts such as Bog Rosemary (<i>Andromeda 
glaucophylla</i>) and Small Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium</i> <i>oxycoccos</i>) as well as some with
greater soil tolerance ranges such as Buckbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), a circumpolar member of
the gentian family (Core 1955) . Of similar nature is the 7000 acre Canaan
Valley complex, the largest wetland in the Central Appalachians. At 3200 feet
elevation and lying just north of the Monongahela National Forest, Canaan
Valley is under consideration for National Wildlife Refuge status.
<p> Some of the
smaller wetlands are also great centers of diversity. An example occurs
alongside Folly Mills Stream in the Shenandoah Valley. This small wetland, at
only 1580 feet asl, is home to an impressive array of northern disluncts as
well as southern species, many of which I first identified less than a decade
ago and which are still being inventoried. As in the Cranberry Glades, Buckbean
occurs here, but in an almost acid - neutral environment of a calcareous marsh
and fen. Here also are such indicators of this environment as Prairie Loosestrife
(<i>Lysimachia quadri - flora</i>) 
and Swamp Lousewort (<i>Pedicularis 
lanceolata</i>) . Other 
northerners include Glaucus Willow (<i>Salix discolor</i>), in its only Virginia occurrence<a href=#2 name=o2>(2)</a>,as well as a
number of rare sedges<a href=#3 name=o3>(3)</a>. Southern species which form a melange<a href=#4 name=o4>(4)</a> with these
northerners are Purple Gerardia (<i>Gerardia 
purpurea</i>) and the rare Large - leaved Grass of Parnassus (<i>Parnassia grandifolia</i>) which is a member of the
saxifrage family. This complex community owes its origin and continued
existence to cool artesian springs and location in a &quot;frost pocket&quot;
by virtue of air drainage from surrounding hills. These factors have combined
to provide a refugium for species that we may infer were originally driven
south by the climate conditions brought about by the ice sheets to the north.
However, unlike northern type communities at higher elevations, this refugium
is confined to the wetland while the surrounding hills are covered by
Appalachian type oak - hickory forest which contains such southerners as Post Oak
and Persimmon but no species of northern affinity<a href=#5 name=o5>(5)</a>.
<p> Sinkhole
ponds along the western edge of Virginia's Blue Ridge harbor such rare
disjuncts as White Buttons (<i>Eriocaulon 
septangulare</i>), and the two - county endemic Virginia Sneezeweed (<i>Helenium virginicum</i>) as well as the Eastern
Tiger Salamander (<i>Ambystoma 
tigrinum tigrinum</i>) . Other,
even rarer, small ponds and wetlands occur at various elevations, some on
perched water tables, and provide habitat for long isolated populations of
salamanders and other species. All are under threat of poor management policies
and roads that expose them to ORVs (Mueller 1991) .
<p> Dry cedar
glades and limestone and shale barrens contain assemblages of drought, cold and
heat resistant plants and animals. Some of the most outstanding examples occur
in West Virginia's Smoke Hole region in the Valley and Ridge Province (The
Nature Conservancy 1991) . There limestone barrens and cedar glades support a
number of Midwestern and Western species, some of which, like Prairie Flax (<i>Linum lewisii</i>), are disjunct from west of the
Mississippi River. The floras of the more common shale barrens have received
considerable attention in recent years and are known for rare species such as
Shale Barren Rock Cress (<i>Arabis 
serotina</i>), a federally listed endangered species (Wieboldt 1991) .
<p> Other
special habitats on exposed ridges and peaks, frequently on rocky terrain,
harbor montane and boreal plants such as Michaux's Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga michauxii</i>), Greenland Sandwort (<i>Arenaria proenlandica</i>) and Three - toothed
Cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla tridentata</i>). However, natural &quot;balds&quot; with extensive grass and shrub
communities in place of trees, such as characterize high elevations in the
Southern Appalachians, are rare in the Central Appalachians. The Central
Appalachians do, though, have numerous small openings in addition to the
previously described heath barrens which are more mesic than the latter. These
merge with the more widespread orchard type summit forests of Northern Red Oak
or in some cases American Beech and hawthorn (Strausbaugh and Core 1977) .
These may have ground covers of grasses such as <i>Danthonia compressa</i>, Hay - scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>), sedges and cushions of
haircap moss (<i>Polytrichum</i> sp) .
Unfortunately the US Forest Service has taken upon itself to create - with
great energy and money expenditure - artificial balds and &quot;savannas&quot;
which only clash with the local ecosystems and fragment the forest.
<p> More common
than the conspicuously novel communities discussed above are some that are
merely unusual in the forest type in which they occur. Frequently they involve
only slight disjunction of common or rare species in combination with the
dominant regional flora. Thus distinctly northern species may occur in mixed
mesophyte forest with dominantly southern species. An example is the occurrence
of northern herbs such as Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>) and the grass <i>Miliun effusum </i>with Tuliptree and Black Walnut
as in the lower Back Creek drainage of Virginia's Valley and Ridge, or Canadian
Yew (<i>Taxus canadensis</i>) and
Mountain Maple at less than 2500 feet asl in certain steep sided northeast
facing gorges that cut through the Allegheny Mountains in West Virginia.
<p> The
occurrence of melange communities and the sequence of types reflect the so -
called &quot;disharmonious&quot; Pleistocene communities which they resemble
and of which they may be relict. According to MacArthur (1975) there is an
inverse relation between species diversity and climatic variability as measured
by winter - summer differences in mean temperature. That is, stabler climates
tend to accommodate more species. A striking case is the small isolated Folly
Mills wetland where the effects of seasonal fluctuations in growing conditions
are moderated by the artesian springs and salubrious chemistry. Thus although
the surrounding forest, which is more subject to climatic variations, is
typically Southern Appalachian, the wetland is a melange of many northern and
even Arctic species with other species of wide as well as decidedly southern
distributions.
<p> With
markedly less disjunction and not separated from the regional forest like the
Folly Mills wetland, are sites with northern mesic species such as <i>Aralia nudicaulis </i>and <i>Milium effusum</i> in a Southern Appalachian mesic
forest type. The cited occurrence in the Back Creek drainage is an example.
<p> Finally,
most common among melange communities is the occurrence of rare and common
northern species - some disjunct, some not - in high elevation wetlands such as
in the Cranberry Glades or in the surrounding forest with which the wetlands
harmonize in climatic type. However, as pointed out earlier, all Central
Appalachian northern type communities also have admixtures of Southern
Appalachian species.
<p> Accompanying
the disjunct and other northern floras of the cooler Central Appalachians are
many animal species. ranging from the Canadian zone Pink - edged Sulfur
Butterfly (<i>Colias interior</i>) to
the Northern Flying Squirrel. This northern fauna also includes such rare
Pleistocene holdovers as the Rock Vole (<i>Microtus chrotorrhinus</i>) which is regarded as
disharmonious with the Eastern Wood rat <i> (Neotoma floridana</i> ; Graham and Lundelius 1984) . This mutual
incompatibility underscores the difficulty in meeting the complex needs of all
native species in any limited reserve system (Mueller 1992c) .
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>Shade Tolerance</h3><ul>
<p><b> </b>In
the Central Appalachians the most shade tolerant species of trees are those
that characteristically occur in the medium moisture, or mesic regimes. They
are the Canadian Hemlock, American Beech, Sugar and Black Maples, Red Spruce
and Balsam Fir, as well as a number of small understory trees among which
Flowering Dogwood, Eastern Hophornbeam and Striped Maple are most common. The
basswoods and Yellow Buckeye are also quite tolerant. Most oak species are of
intermediate tolerance. However Scarlet Oak shows low tolerance of shade, as do
Tuliptree, Black Cherry and most of the birches. Shagbark Hickory, a tree of
rich mesic environments, is moderately tolerant but other members of this genus
and the related walnuts are relatively intolerant. Some species, such as White
Pine and White Ash, are very tolerant when young but become intolerant with
age.
<p> Red Maple,
which is of intermediate tolerance, but more tolerant than any oak, has a
special role. Red Maple is at home in habitats ranging from southern swamps to
the driest mountain ridges and the fringes of the boreal forest. Because
conditions exclude the most tolerant species such as American Beech and Sugar
Maple, Red Maple, along with Striped Maple, is frequently the most tolerant
species in the xeric oak - chestnut forests of the Central Appalachians. As a
consequence it has become a prime scapegoat and cover for a multitude of
silvicultural sins perpetrated by the US Forest Service and other industrial
foresters.
<p> Virgin
mixed mesophyte forests have an abundance of species of all shade tolerance
levels. Thus Tuliptree and intolerant oaks are major components even of many
stands where shade tolerant species frequently dominate. In the dry oak -
chestnut forests, intermediate and intolerant oaks (White, Chestnut, Black,
Red and Scarlet) dominate in stands undisturbed by humans, since the most
tolerant species are excluded by soil and climate. This fact is a source of
embarrassment to the Forest Service, which steadfastly maintains that the
commercially desirable but intolerant oaks need the help of large openings such
as clearcuts to reproduce and prevent takeover by Red Maple and other undesirable
species. The prominent ecological forester Leon Minckler has repeatedly made
the point that large openings are not necessary for reproduction (e.g.
Minckler 1974) . It is becoming increasingly clear that a major mechanism of
forest reproduction in mature deciduous forests is the formation of tree fall
gaps which allow sufficient light to encourage even the least tolerant species.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>Role of Fire</h3><ul>
<p> Next to
tree fall gaps, usually formed by windthrow, fire was probably most
responsible for natural forest openings.
While the role of fire in the Central Appalachians is still poorly understood.
extensive observations by Virginians for wilderness have revealed
surprising effects of this agent. Quite
obviously fire was most common in the dry oak - chestnut and oak - pine uplands
before human suppression became routine. However, many trees in moist coves
also show fire scars. This is probably a consequence of the relatively thin
bark of many cove species such as Shagbark Hickory, Beech and Tuliptree, as
compared with thick - barked Chestnut Oak for example. Although the virgin high
elevation spruce forests of the Allegheny Plateau presumably had substantial
fire potential, it appears that the prevailing high moisture levels prevented
many fires until logging and land clearing produced incendiary slashings and
ignition sparks.
<p> In addition
to charred wood, evidence for forest fires frequently takes the form of
inverted U - shaped basal trunk scars or cavities. These scars are usually
confined to a single (lee?) side of the tree for any given fire. Also
evidencing fire are sprout clumps in which the sprouts of individual clumps are
widely spaced. In contrast to logging, fires tend to kill stumps so that
sprouting is from surrounding roots. Where such sprouting occurs, it points to
high fire frequencies in the past since trees in excess of 100 years of age
seldom sprout much. Such evidence has a bearing on the identification of
primary and old - growth stands. Contrary to some opinions, however, fires set
by indigenous Americans or otherwise were not required to protect Appalachian
oak forests from invasion by more shade tolerant species.
<p> Although
oaks are fairly resistant to fire - particularly Chestnut Oak with its thick
bark ridges - they are not as all - around fire adapted as Shortleaf, Pitch and
Table Mountain Pines. Examination of these pines reveals multi - layered and
hence highly insulated bark. Consequently, although oaks in a burn area may
show fire scars and even high mortality, coexisting Pitch Pine and Table
Mountain Pine show only blackened lower trunks with no visible damage to living
tissues<a href=#6 name=o6>(6)</a>. As a result of this fire resistance, pines may be the oldest and
largest trees on some dry sites.Also, since they have serotinous cones and, in
the case of pitch and Shortleaf Pines,
sprouting ability, they are ever ready to renew themselves should an intense
fire occur. By contrast White Pine is not nearly as fire - adapted<a href=#7 name=o7>(7)</a>.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>Other Disturbances</h3><ul>
<p> Exposed
ridges most subject to fire are also most vulnerable to high winds and ice
storms which result in the common high elevation forms of orchard type
deciduous trees and the one - sided banner forms, particularly of conifers such
as pine and spruce. Although large blow - downs are not as common in the Central
Appalachians as in boreal forests, wind does sometimes have widespread effects,
as in the case of Hurricane Hugo.
<p> Disturbances
that involve insects and diseases are, unfortunately, exploited by special
interests. An example is the current rash of salvage timber sales attributed to
Gypsy Moth defoliation, particularly in the George Washington National Forest,
at the leading edge of the southward advance of this insect. The FS makes
sporadic vain attempts at suppression. Here I espouse the diametrically opposite
view, namely that insects and diseases are a part of normal forest evolution
and that they can be accommodated as long as the forest tracts are large,
healthy and diverse enough to harbor the seeds of resistance and re -
colonization. Although the Gypsy Moth, Chestnut Blight and Dutch Elm Disease
are all particularly virulent, in part because of their human vectors, such
virulence is not unknown in nature<a href=#8 name=o8>(8)</a>.
<p> In addition
to disturbances clearly attributable to well identified insects and diseases is
a vaguely defined condition known as &quot;oak decline&quot; which is said to
be ravaging the Southern and Central Appalachians. I say &quot;condition&quot;
because it is not at all clear that oak decline is a disease within the
conventional meaning. It is said to be characterized by symptoms such as
chlorosis, limb dieback and epicormic branching, mostly in the red oak group.
Forest Service experts have yet to find a solid explanation for the condition
and are forced to fall back on a broad spectrum of insects and diseases triggered
by such factors as drought and poor site quality (Stark <i>et al</i> 1989) .
In his discussion of oak decline in the Southern Appalachians, Zahner (1992) 
proposed &quot;benign neglect&quot; as a proper curative agent. He attributed
many of the symptoms to normal senescence of comparatively short - lived
species such as Scarlet and Black Oak in the process of replacement by longer -
lived Chestnut and White Oak. Certainly the public agencies make little effort
to find causes of oak decline in past management practices which have brought
about changes in soils, moisture regimes and even forest types over wide areas.
As Lucy Braun recognized long ago, many rich mixed mesophyte forests have been
degraded through cutting to depauperate and xeric oak - pine stands, consisting
mostly of the short - lived species referred to by Zahner. Oak decline may
manifest a healing process of reversion to a more complex forest type through
succession from simple, excessively oak
- rich stands that have resulted from human activities. In many areas where the
Forest Service has identified oak decline in the Central Appalachians, they
have used a heavy dose of imagination and have failed to distinguish it from
normal limb shedding and mortality in a healthy forest.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>Succession and Secular Change</h3><ul>
<p> The
result of natural and human induced disturbances is succession, the progressive
change of biological habitat from one occupied by pioneering species to some
form of &quot;climax&quot; community. In forests this progression is usually
from shade intolerant to tolerant species, since many intolerant species are
adapted to the high light intensity and degraded soils of forest openings.
However, many tolerant species also do well in openings, especially if they
originate from sprouts, or, like Red Maple, are adapted to hash conditions. It
was once rather naively thought that eastern North American deciduous forests
inevitably progressed toward a beech - maple climax, an idea that gained
credence chiefly in the Northeast, where this climax is common because of the
climate and limited species richness (and where many foresters lived) .
However it was subsequently learned that the climax community of mixed
mesophyte forest includes many common intolerant species. Also, as stressed by
Lucy Braun, some major forest types, such as oak - chestnut, are <i>physiographic</i>
climaxes[ The author of this article no longer believes that this term is
valid, but that these forest climaxes have the same basis as that of the mixed
mesophyte type.] consisting of shade intolerant species like oaks and pines. In
all these Eastern forest types, tree - falls, fires, blow - downs and other
disturbances are frequent enough to perpetuate intolerant species.
<p> Associated
with the great forest migrations after the glacial maximum were, in all
probability, corresponding changes in soil types. Evidence comes from studies
in glaciated regions in which all soil changes occurred less than 10,000 years
ago (Armson 1979). The speed with which such changes can occur was
illustrated by Langmaid (1964) who showed that earth worms could obliterate
upper horizons of podzol in as little as three years. In their studies of soils
in a prairie ecotone in Minnesota, Severson and Arnemann (1973) found that
transformation of mesic deciduous to pine - hardwood forest was accompanied by
alterations of the soil profile to one meter depth in less than 2000 years.
These results lead one to believe that soil adjustments could easily have kept
pace with changes in vegetation type in the Central Appalachians during the
last 18,000 years. Soil transformations, which depend on favorable kinetics in
chemical and micro - organic reactions, appear to be far more rapid than
secular genetic adjustments since the glacial maximum. Genetic inertia seems to
perpetuate certain Pleistocene characters in the flora (Mueller 1990) . Such
appears to be the case in the persistence of conspicuously thorned trees such
as the hawthorns (Crataegus) which may have developed thorns as a defense
against the Pleistocene browsing
msgafauna in eastern North America. In support of this conclusion, since the
disappearance of this megafauna, virtually the only browser in much of the
region has been the White - tailed Deer, a species that easily browses between
the large thorns. In the Central Appalachians these thorny ice age holdovers
still occupy a great variety of niches including the understory of closed
canopy deciduous forests and the most exposed mountain peaks.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>Old Growth</h3><ul>
<p> Old growth
is the touchstone of ecological forestry. Foresters who fail to recognize its
importance can only claim to be industrial woodcutters. Zahner (1989) gave
the following simple definition: &quot;Old Growth forests are forests having a
long uninterrupted period of development.&quot; Note that this definition says
nothing about the ages of individual trees but says a great deal about their
habitat. This definition fits the Central Appalachians well because, while
easily identifiable old growth with obviously old, large trees, is scarce, many
stands seem undisturbed by humans, and may qualify despite a scarcity of old
trees. In many forest types - cove, mixed mesophyte, northern hardwood, spruce
montane and various dry oak forests - large old trees are still being
discovered. An old stand was recently found in cutting unit one of the proposed
Stillhouse Timber Sale - even though the George Washington National Forest
officials had attempted to conceal its existence. However, in the driest oak -
chestnut and oak - pine forests on inaccessible ridges we find ambiguity. Many
such areas burned frequently in the past. Thus, although, except for the loss
of Chestnut, such stands may be primary and even virgin; they may contain few
old trees and so are difficult to distinguish from stands disturbed by humans.
<p> The ages of
tree species have considerable significance with respect to their
classification by industrial foresters. The US Forest Service regularly twists
normal tree mortality data to justify timber sales. They attempt to conceal
that, as a healthy forest matures, most, indeed more than 99 percent, of its
trees must die before it reaches maturity, to say nothing of old growth. And
this mortality is entirely independent of species longevity. Most of this
mortality occurs while the forest is still young. Industrial foresters would
have us believe that 80 - 90 year old stands are &quot;decadent&quot;,
&quot;overmature&quot; or &quot;falling apart&quot; because they contain dead
trees. In this distortion they ignore their own literature (e. g. Fowells 1965
) which gives the following commonly attained ages for eastern forest trees:
White Oak 600 years, Northern Red Oak 200 - 300 years, Black Oak 200 years,
Sugar Maple 400 years, American Beech more than360 years, White Pine 450 years
and Canadian Hemlock 900 years. These data show that survivors in a healthy maturing
forest have the capacity of attaining far greater ages and larger sizes than
those classified as mature by industrial foresters.
<p> The
greatest significance of old growth lies in the now rare habitat niches it
contains. Features such as large standing (frequently hollow) snags, abundant
large woody debris, stream debris dams, pit and mound topography, and canopy
gaps that result from large tree falls are some of the criteria for old growth<a href=#9 name=o9>(9)</a>. Recently edaphic macropores, large elongated openings in soils due to root
decay or burrowing by animals, have been stressed by Martin (1992) in his
discussion of old growth mixed mesophyte forests. Such features combine to form
a complex horizontal and vertical structure that can accommodate a great diversity
of sensitive forest interior species. Examples include most salamanders, small
mammals, neotropical migratory birds and large raptors like the Coopers Hawk.
Old growth also hosts abundant
arthropods, some, like millipedes, striking in appearance, some endemic (
Hoffman 1991).
<p> Steve
Krichbaum has stressed the importance of the regional setting and area required
to sustain old growth conditions and species (personal communication) . Martin
 (1992) also stressed the need to protect old growth on a watershed scale. In
small &quot;stands&quot; of old growth now being proposed by the Forest Service
as adjuncts to their destructive timbering and &quot;wildlife&quot; operations,
stochastic effects, from storm, fire, insects or pathogens, will soon profoundly
degrade, convert to &quot;all edge&quot; or extirpate these stands.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul></ul><h2>HUMAN IMPACTS ON THE FOREST</h2><ul>
<p> 
 <h3>Killer Roads</h3><ul>
<p> Virtually
all forest destruction begins with roads. Forest roads are the loci of many
evils: erosion, sedimentation, drainage interruption and diversion; barrier
formation; wildlife entrapment, exclusion and concentration; and as conduits of
alien pests and diseases like Spotted Knapweed and the Gypsy Moth (Noss 1992b
). Roads may even capture streams when their eroding beds cross natural
channels. The Forest Service and other agencies rely on &quot;water bars&quot;
to prevent erosion of the road surface by deflecting the water to the side.
However, these structures only add to the impact of roads since they require
ditches and disturbed areas in the surrounding forest. In the Central Appalachians,
Forest Service road - building has degraded many riparian zones as along the
North River in the Proposed Shenandoah Wilderness [ now proposed as the
&quot;Ernie Dickerman Wilderness&quot; ]. Roads to the tops of mountain peaks,
such as Reddish Knob in the Shenandoah Range and White Top in the Mt. Rogers
National Recreation Area, have sparked recent controversies and a flurry of
appeals. Like their Western counterparts these peaks are &quot;sky
islands&quot; that harbor assemblages of rare and disjunct species which the Forest Service is prepared
to sacrifice in the name of &quot;driving for pleasure&quot;, &quot;scenic
vistas&quot; and even &quot;star gazing.&quot;
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>Timber Madness</h3><ul>
<p> While roads
fragment and open the forest to development, industrial timber management
devastates the mountains in massive blocks. Easily the worst of the timbering
methods is clearcutting, in which all trees down to seedling size are felled
and the forest floor is churned under the tracks of bulldozers. Clearcutting
has been the focus of opposition to logging (Fritz 1989) . In its response to
the threat to its image the Forest Service has, with fanfare, been shifting to
shelterwood, seed tree and other generally more benign <i>sounding </i>methods.
However, all alternative methods now in use fall under the dominant category of<i>
even - age management </i>and depend on the same heavy equipment abuse as
clearcutting even if they allow some trees to stand awhile. All are implicated
in recent studies by Duffy and Meier (1992) who have shown that herbaceous
understory vegetation probably takes hundreds of years to recover and
re-colonize in such abused forest. Analogous studies by Petranka et al (1993) 
indicate equally devastating effects on salamanders, with recovery times of 50
- 70 years for these sensitive animals<a href=#11 name=o11>(11)</a>. Research by Raymond and Hardy (
1991) established that populations of mole salamanders are significantly
affected by clearcutting even in land adjacent to the clearcut.
<p> Some
activists propose selective logging of small groups (group selection) or of
individual trees as more benign alternatives to even - age logging. Others (e.
g. Noss 1992c) maintain that selective logging may be as damaging as
clearcutting because of the larger area impacted for the same volume harvested
and the frequency of entry (every ten years or so) . I have personally
observed that selective logging can have far less impact on the forest floor
than clearcutting. However, to attain equal volume this mild damage must be
spread over a far larger area. Negative effects of selective logging probably correspond to the short 
rotations (time between successive harvests) usually employed . Given
a minimum rotation period of 150 years and selective logging without entry for
this long, many, but not all, detrimental effects would likely vanish.
Notwithstanding any conceivable advantage of 
selective logging, however, serious damage accompanies any type of
industrial scale logging in the mountainous sections of the Central
Appalachians<a href=#10 name=o10>(10)</a>. Most serious is the inevitable degradation any form of
logging brings to the region's fragile, nutrient - poor soils and the
fragmentation by the many required roads.
<p> Deciduous
forests have the capacity to regenerate (form anew) by either seeding or by
sprouting from the stumps and roots of cut trees. Trees in excess of 100 years
in age seldom sprout much, which allows us to determine the recent history
of the forest by the presence or
absence and type of sprouts. Although logging - induced sprouts are common in
agricultural areas such as the Shenandoah Valley and the Piedmont, where
immature trees have been cut repeatedly, they are less common in the mountains
where large areas are recovering from the turn - of - the- century logging of the primary forest. There are
exceptions, of course, particularly in mountain areas that have been repeatedly
burned. On average, however, the result of natural regeneration is stands of 80 - 90 year old single - stemmed trees
which contrast starkly with the young stands of multiple sprout clumps in
recent clearcuts. The sprouts of clearcuts frequently produce inferior trees,
because they originate either high on the stump and thus rot, or low on the
stump or from the roots, where they bow outward (Mueller 1992b) . 
<p> Short
rotations and even - age management also cause poor regeneration and forest
health due to loss of nutrients associated with cutting and extracting many
small trees from the site. Since most nutrients are bound in the cambium [
actually, in the entire outer, partly living part of the tree, including the
cambium, as distinguished from the heartwood ], small trees [ since they have
proportionally less heartwood ] bear a greater proportion of these nutrients
than do large trees, leading to excessive soil depletion. Robinson (1988) 
discussed this factor, as well as the relatively greater expense per board foot
of harvesting small timber.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>&quot;Forest Health&quot;</h3><ul>
<p> Presumably
everyone is for forest health, but this term has a different meaning for the
Forest Service than for the rest of us. Whereas the enlightened regard a
naturally evolving forest as the epitome of health, benighted industrial
loggers focus on the dead and dying components and call for salvage and even
pre - salvage logging, the latter a preemptive strike on healthy trees seen as
threatened by disease or insects. In the Central Appalachians concern is
largely with oak decline and the Gypsy Moth. Playing the roles of first and
second violins, &quot;oak decline&quot; is orchestrated as making the forest
more susceptible to the Moth. The stage is then set for replacement of mature
trees with more &quot;vigorous&quot; trees of even - age cuts before the Moth
strikes. Despite the FS's use of this argument in numerous timber sales in the
George Washington NF, we have yet to find evidence of oak decline that goes beyond
expected dieback and mortality in a normal, healthy forest (Jones 1992,
Krichbaum 1992) . Stands singled out as declining in the White Rock Sale, for
instance, fail to show even minimal criteria of chlorosis, limb dieback and
epicormic branching. Not surprisingly the Forest Service conducted no
quantitative surveys for oak decline in these sale areas; by their own
admission, they used only a qualitative &quot;eyeball&quot; determination to
identify oak decline.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>Wildlife Management Disasters</h3><ul>
<p> The US
Forest Service and the state agencies still promote logging as a benefit to
wildlife. Not only is even - age logging said to have this side benefit, but
expressly designed &quot;wildlife openings&quot; are standard elements of
commercial sales these days. In the White Rock Sale extensive new even - age
cuts are slated for 2255 acres that already contain more than 35 &quot;wildlife
openings&quot; of several acres each as well as extensive recent clearcuts. The
area, typical of the more accessible parts of the Central Appalachians, is thus
already so fragmented and contains so much edge habitat that, although its
forest tracts are connected, it contains no real forest interior habitat. In
addition, habitat of many forest species such as salamanders has been reduced
through the destruction of the forest floor in these fertilized, mowed and
grass covered openings.
<p> In many
areas the abundant edge - loving species - Deer, Raccoons, Cowbirds, etc. -
have had a profound effect on forest interior species. One victim is the Canada
Yew, a northern evergreen shrub once common at higher elevations and even on
some cool low elevation sites in the Central Appalachians. Today this plant has
been virtually extirpated over much of its range by severe Deer browsing and
survives only on steep rocky sites less accessible to Deer. Also, many rare,
disjunct species are suffering, as for example in the boreal plant communities
of Blister Swamp, which lies partly within the Monongahela National Forest (
Mueller 1992c) . In this diverse wetland no Balsam Fir between the size of minute
seedlings and three inch diameter saplings have escaped the Deer; reproduction
has halted. Twinflower (<i>Linnaea 
borealis</i>), Alder leaved Buckthorn (<i>Rhamnus alnifolia</i>) and other rare disjuncts are
also at risk. A recent inventory (Miller <i>et al</i> 1992) of plants
disturbed by White - tailed Deer revealed that more than 40 % occur in the
Central Appalachians.
<p> Even
apparently benign wildlife, such as Ruffed Grouse and Wild Turkey, may have
profound negative impacts when promoted as game species. Wildlife openings and
constructed water holes may encourage a local overabundance of these birds. The
result will be intensified foraging for small amphibians and reptiles,
including rare salamanders, snakes and lizards. These &quot;game&quot; birds
may also eat neotropical migratory bird eggs and young, since many songbirds,
especially warblers, are ground nesters. In addition, water holes may bring
water breeding salamanders that may compete with or prey upon rare woodland
salamanders.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>Proposed Endangered, Threatened and Sensitive (PETS) Species</h3><ul>
<p> Roads,
timber sales, wildlife management and general development pressures have
resulted in a hefty burden of Threatened, Endangered and sensitive species.
Many additional species are propose for listing as Threatened or Endangered.
Sensitive species are &quot;those plant and animal species identified by the
Regional Forester for which population viability is a concern as evidenced by
(a) significant current or predicted downward trends in population numbers or
density and (b) significant current or predicted downward trends in habitat
capability that would reduce a species' existing distribution.&quot; (Forest
Service Manual 19/26, Amendment 52, Title 2600) . Canadian Yew fits this
definition better than many designated sensitive plants and in addition is
conspicuous and easily identifiable. Yet neither managers of the Monongahela
nor the George Washington National Forest, both of which fall in its historic
range, have adopted it as sensitive. In the Monongahela, where the plant was once
common, its catastrophic decline in numbers is a source of Forest Service
embarrassment.
<p> Most Forest
Service lists of sensitive species fail to include a significant number of deep
woods species since this would slow down timber sales. Instead these lists are
heavy on very rare, but not necessarily declining, components of unusual
communities of restricted occurrence. Listing such species as sensitive is
prudent, but more common and conspicuous species in decline in representative
forest types also need listing.
<p> In some
cases PETS species lists are even used to divert attention from threats to
biodiversity. Examples are PETS lists prepared by the Monongahela National
Forest for the High Top and Douthat Creek Opportunity Areas in which species
such as the Cheat Mountain Salamander from other parts of the Forest appear but
species of high occurrence and probability such as the Jefferson Salamander are
not mentioned. Such bogus lists make it easy to eliminate habitat
considerations and get on with the timber sales.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><h3>General Abuses</h3><ul>
 
<p> The failure
to protect PETS species in our National Forests and other public lands is
grounded in more general derelictions. Primarily there is a reluctance to
recognize that a forest is more than trees. Consequently no systematic
inventories are done of even the most visible elements of diversity, the
herbaceous plants, shrubs and trees other than commercial species<a href=#12 name=o12>(12)</a>.
Similarly, the lavish concern devoted to &quot;game&quot; species is not
accompanied by anything like equal attention to sensitive &quot;non -
game&quot; animals. The FS rarely conducts site - specific surveys, as we found
on the notorious California Timber Sale (Mueller and Hammond 1990) and many
others, and tends to ignore unique habitats if they occur in timber sale areas.
When frustrated in their destructive designs, the FS makes every effort to
stonewall protection. Thus although Virginians for Wilderness managed to save a
rare mountain pond from the Mill Mountain Timber Sale (Mueller 1992a), the
Forest service still fails to recognize the pond in its newly released Forest
Plan and again threatens nearby areas with roading and development.
<p> To
frustrate the public's right to know, the Forest Service routinely omits
monitoring and record keeping of ecosystems under its care as well as its own
actions in them. In 1986 the FS carried out a &quot;prescribed burn&quot; on
Signal Corps Knob next to a clearcut. When we inquired about this burn, they
could at first find no record and could only date it to the year and season by
asking around the District office. Here in the late 20th century, the Forest
Service still keeps some of its records in the oral tradition! Thus any
ecological or management information that might conceivably have been gained
was lost along with many large high quality Red and Chestnut Oaks.
<p> The Forest
Service frequently employs faulty logic and science to accomplish its ends. In
their analysis of the Big Flattop Opportunity Area in the Jefferson National
Forest, Forest Supervisor Joy Berg made the following statement:
<p> <i>During
harvesting activities, the various wildlife species that utilize the area would
be displaced to adjacent stands or drainages. In my judgment this displacement
would be acceptable, short term, and would not result in measurable population
reductions or overcrowding within the Opportunity Area.</i>
<p><i> </i>This
reasoning flies in the face of population dynamics. It fails to consider that
adjacent like drainages in all probability are already occupied so that
overcrowding <i>would</i> result. It also fails to take into account the
immobility and limited re-colonization ability of many herbaceous species and
animals such as woodland salamanders, as documented by Duffy and Meier and
Petranka <i>et al</i>.
<p> In numerous
environmental assessments, the FS often makes the spurious argument that forest
fragmentation occurs only in isolated woodlots of agricultural terrain and not
in continuous forest interrupted by wildlife openings and even - age timber
cuts. This conclusion has been refuted by David Wilcove and other authorities (
Young 1992).
<p> The
ecological indictment of the US Forest Service extends to the highest levels.
Nothing illustrates this better than the illegal and deceitful responses of a
Regional Forester to citizen appeals of timber sales and other actions taken by
his agency. In his finding on the Big Flattop Opportunity Area appeals, Region
8 Forester John Alcock refused to consider the impacts of timber sales and road
building on PETS species that were not discussed in the scoping process (
Bamford and Mueller 1992) . This same finding was also applied to the issue of wildlife displacement and
crowding resulting from habitat destruction. In addition, Alcock bluntly stated
that herbaceous species need not be considered in the environmental assessment,
All this is in violation of the Forest Service Manual (Title 2600) . Alcock's
decision was so sloppily concocted as to conclude that &quot;no PETS species of
'anthropods' [sic!] are found on the JNF.&quot; If we translate to
&quot;arthropods,&quot; the beetle <i>Sphaeroderus schaumi</i> proves him wrong. In a final insult to the public,
Alcock threw out all literature references in the appeals on the grounds that
the actual papers and volumes referred to were not sent to his office in
Atlanta, thus ignoring literature easily accessible in his library down the
hall. Such arrogance is made generic in most appeals as questions issued by the
appellant are simply reworded as answers by the reviewing officer. Thus the
chain of mismanagement and corruption is complete from the Chief in Washington
to managers of the most remote biological communities, threatening these
communities with bureaucratic extirpation.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul></ul><h2>Epilog</h2><ul>
<p> There
is an inspiration in the rolling blue ridges that triumphs over their glum
prognosis. Now and then, discouraged by the juggernaut, our little band of
Virginians feels the forest's healing influence even while surveying clearcut
wastelands, knowing that paths also lead to groves we might yet save. We think
of our vision of the future as proactive, leaping ahead of the bureaucratic
destruction we fight each day to the wilderness reserves we know are the only
feasible salvation of these mountains.
<p> Knowing
that every one can help, we dare reach into the cogs of the machine itself,
hoping to find kindred spirits to aid our cause. We appeal to those active and
potential moles in the agencies, particularly in the US Forest Service, who may
have knowledge of illegal roads, timber sales (or give - aways) or other law
circumventions. We'll keep your confidence. Try Virginians for Wilderness, and
feel good about the mountains next time you get up.

 <a href=#o1 name=1>(1)</a> Fruit orchardists know this form to be
most stable in bearing heavy loads of fruit. 
 
<p><a href=#o2 name=2>(2)</a> This plant is considered rare even on the Allegheny
Plateau.
 
<p><a href=#o3 name=3>(3)</a> These and a number of other rare plants were identified
by Dr. Robert Hunsucker only recently.
 
<p><a href=#o4 name=4>(4)</a> I use this term to distinguish such assemblages from
mixed forest.
 
<p><a href=#o5 name=5>(5)</a> An extreme case is Ice Mountain, West Virginia where a
boreal community occurs only 700 feet (214 meters) above sea level (asl) 
associated with permanent ice collected in a talus slope (Strausbaugh and Core
1977).
 
<p><a href=#o6 name=6>(6)</a> An excellent example of this differential effect of fire
may be seen on the mountainside just east of the Hone Quarry Campground in the
Dry River Ranger District of the George Washington National Forest.
 
<p><a href=#o7 name=7>(7)</a> Many trees also have quite subtle fire adapted or
resistant characteristics. These include rock accumulation rings concentric
about the tree base that build up by
diameter growth, and greatly thickened bark on the lower and hence most fire -
exposed sides of leaning trunks.
 
<p><a href=#o8 name=8>(8)</a> Pollen data indicate that some pathogen or insect
brought about a catastrophic decline in Canadian Hemlock over wide areas if
eastern North America about 4800 years ago (Davis 1981) .
 
<p><a href=#o9 name=9>(9)</a> Such features are present in a stand of large Chestnut
and White Oaks of the proposed Stillhouse Timber Sale mentioned earlier. In
addition a complex fire history is displayed in this stand.
 
<p><a href=#o10 name=10>(10)</a> Most logging contractors today possess only heavy
equipment so they almost incapable of gentler logging methods.
 
<p><a href=#o11 name=11>(11)</a> Steve Krichbaum points out that the data of Petranka <i>et
al</i> do not include the numerous salamanders that die immediately while
timber operations are occurring.
 
<p><a href=#o12 name=12>(12)</a> An example is Butternut (<i>Juglans cinerea</i>), a federal C2 species but
ignored quite generally in Forest Service actions
