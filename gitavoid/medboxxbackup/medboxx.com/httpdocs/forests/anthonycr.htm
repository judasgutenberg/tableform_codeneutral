<h2>Old Growth/Anthony Creek</h2>
<ul>
<h3>Source Walks: 5-20-98, 5-21-98 and 6-28-98</h3>

The tract of old growth or ancient forest near Neola, West Virginia occupies an east-facing 
slope just west of the North Fork of Anthony Creek. It is probably the same tract 
that was depicted by Lucy Braun (1950 ) in her <i>Deciduous Forests</i>
 <i>of Eastern North America</i>
. Elevations range from 2040 feet (622 m ) along the Creek, to a little above 2200 
ft (671) asl on the slope. Country rock here is Devonian Braillier Formation, which 
is dominated by shale with subordinate siltstone and sandstone. Consequently there 
are few rock outcrops and topography is subdued. No evidence of carbonate rocks was seen 
and upland soils appeared rather infertile. The regime of the upland forest, including 
the old growth is prevailingly xeric and acidic but differs in some respects from 
typical oak-chestnut type of the Valley and Ridge, especially in the widespread occurrence 
of Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>).<p>
Our inventory of the ancient forest was conducted from late morning to mid-afternoon 
of 5-20-98 under clear skies and pleasant temperatures. It consisted of two loop 
traverses up the slope and returns to the Creek road.<p>
The ancient forest canopy is dominated by large white Pine and White Oak with smaller 
Northern Red Oak, Canada Hemlock, Red Maple, Beech, Black Gum, Shagbark and Pignut 
Hickories and minor Black Oak, Black Cherry and Sugar Maple. Red Maple is common 
as seedlings, as is Northern Red Oak and Beech to a lesser degree. Pignut seedlings are 
widespread, although sparsely distributed, while Black Oak seems confined to the 
upper slope.There are also some American Chestnut (<i>Castanea</i>
 <i>dentata </i>) sprouts and relict down boles. Understory species noted were Downy Serviceberry 
(<i>Amelanchie arborea</i>), Hophornbeam, Muscletree in moister areas and hawthorns identfied as <i>Crataegus punctata</i>
 and <i>C. flabellata.</i>
 Shrubs included Witch Hazel, Beaked Hazelnut (<i>Corylus cornuta </i>), Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>) also in moist areas, Maple-leaf and Black Haw Viburnums (<i>Viburnum acerifolium</i>
  and <i>V. prunifolium </i>), Deer Berry (<i>Vaccinium</i>
 <i>stamineum </i>), Upland Low and Early Low Blueberries (<i>V. pallidum</i>
 and <i>V. angustifolium</i>), the misnamed Pasture Rose (<i>Rosa carolina </i>), Allegheny Blackberry <i>(Rubus allegheniensis</i>), Alternate-leaf Dogwood (<i> Cornus alternifolia</i>), a very little Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea arborescens</i>), Flame Azalea <i>(Rhododendron</i>
 <i>calendulaceum </i>) and Mountain Fetterbush (<i>Pieris floribunda</i>). A single bush of an alien Honeysuckle was seen. <p>
Vines were not common but included Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</i>), Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus radicans </i>) in moist areas, scattered Common and Hispid Greenbriers (<i>Smilax rotundifolia </i>
and <i>S. hispida</i>) and a little Summer Grape (<i> Vitis aestivalis </i>).<p>
Among herbs Partridge Berry and a Gall-of-the-Earth (<i>Prenanthes</i>
  sp ) seemed most widespread, being present in upland as well as lower areas. Hay-scented 
Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>) and New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris</i>
 <i>noveboracensis</i>)were abundant and there was scattered Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris</i>
 <i>intermedia</i>)  , Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum</i>
 <i>acrostichoides </i>), a little Maidenhair Fern (<i>Adiantum</i>
 <i>pedatum </i>) and a very little Sensitive Fern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>). <p>
Herbs generally less widespread were Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis stricta</i>), Creeping Five-leaf (<i> Potentilla</i>
 <i>simplex/canadensis </i>), Hispid Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus hispidus </i>), Wood Anemone (<i> Anemone quinquefolia</i>), Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Soidago rugosa</i>), White Wood Aster (<i>Aster divaricatus</i>) (quite widespread ), Big-leaf Aster (<i> Aster macrophyllus</i>), Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum lanuginosum </i>), Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum </i>), Hairy Bedstraw (<i> G. pilosum</i>), Wild Liquorice (<i>G. circaezans </i>), Lance-leaf Wild Liquorice (<i>G. lanceolatum </i>), Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia perfofoliata </i>), Sessile-leaved Bellwort  (<i>U. sessilifolia </i>), Mountain Bellwort (<i>U. pudica</i>), Round-leaved Pyrola (<i>Pyrola</i>
 <i>rotundifolia </i>), Blunt-lobed Hepatica (<i>Hepatica</i>
 <i>americana</i>), a quite widespread species, Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio aureus </i>) in bloom, Small's Ragwort (<i> S. smallii </i>), a little Wild Comfrey (<i>Cynoglossum virginianum </i>), Canada Brome Grass (<i>Bromus purgans </i>), Noddng Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>), Short-leaved Bluegrass (<i>Poa cuspidata </i>), a little of the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>
, the northern forest bluegrass <i>Poa alsodes,</i>
 Black Cohosh (<i> Cimicifuga racemosa </i>), Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>), Smooth Yellow Violet (<i>V. pensylvanica</i>), Sweet White Violet (<i>V. blanda </i>), Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>), Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>), a single small patch of Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense </i>) under Hemlock, a little Hairy Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza</i>
 <i>claytoni </i>), Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>), Bloodroot (<i>Sanguinaria</i>
 <i>canadensis </i>), Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea </i>), Gaywings (<i>Polygala paucifolia </i>), Cow Wheat (<i>Melampyrum lineare</i>), a little Trout Lily (<i>Erythronium</i>) of unknown species, Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa</i>
 <i>uniflora</i>), possible Showy Orchid (<i> Orchis spectabilis</i>) based on leaves, Enchanter's Nightshade (<i>Circaea quadrisulcata</i>), White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium rugosum </i>), Wreath Goldenrod (<i>Solidago caesia </i>), Tall Meadowrue (<i> Thalictrum polygamum</i>), Horse Balm (<i> Collinsonia</i>
 <i>canadensis </i>), Great Chickweed (<i> Stellaria pubera </i>), Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa</i>
 <i>bracteata </i>), Hooked Crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus recurvatus</i>), a Tick-trefoil <i>Desmodium glutinosum</i>
, Wild Lily of the Valley (<i>Convallari montana </i>), Squaw Root (<i>Conophlis</i>
 <i>americana</i>), an agrimony (<i>Agrimonia</i>
 sp ), Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia</i>
 <i>quadrifolia</i>), Wingstem (<i>Verbesina</i>
 <i>alternifolia</i>), Barren Strawberry (<i>Waldsteinia fragarioides</i>), Wild Geranium (<i>Geranium</i>
 <i>maculatum </i>), a wood rush <i>Luzula echinata</i>
, a panic grass <i>Panicum boscii</i>
, Virginia Spring Beauty (<i>Claytonia virginiana</i>), Moccasin Flower (<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>), Common Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum biflorum</i>), a single plant of May Apple (<i>Podophyllum peltatum</i>) and a little Tree Club Moss (<i>Lycopodium obscurum</i>).<p>
Sedges included <i>Carex laxiculmis</i>,<i> C. prasina,</i>
 <i>C. amphibola, C</i>. <i>willdenowii</i>, <i>C. purpurea</i>, <i>C. laxiflora</i>
  and<i> C. platyphylla</i>. The first three species occur in low woods near the road and may have been influenced 
by nutrients from that source, whereas the others are more characteristic of and 
were found within the upland forest.<p>
Sizes of some of the largest trees in dbh were as follows:<p>
White Oak: 4 feet (1.2 m ), 57 inches (1.4 m), 3 feet (0.92 m), 40 inches (1 m) <p>
White Pine: 3 feet (0.92 m), 40 inches (i m), 42 inches (1.1 m )<p>
These trees are of good form and the White Pine in particular is tall, although heights 
were not determined since these were deemed less significant than diameters.<p>
Bryophytes, and especially mosses, were, with lichens, diverse and abundant on soil 
and tree bases, lower trunks and on dead wood on the forest floor. Large old down 
boles were characteristically moss-covered in the general absence of rocks. In what 
follows liverworts and lichens are explicitly indicated while mosses constitute the rest.

A community associated with the 40 inch dbh White Pine included a dense patch of Mountain 
Fetterbush with Early Low Blueberry,  Deer Berry, numerous seedlings and saplings 
of White Pine, a few Hemlock seedlings and Flame Azalea in bloom.<p>
Quite generally, seedlings of the dominant canopy White Pine and White Oak were abundant, 
as were those of Northern Red Oak and Red Maple. Scattered Sugar Maple seedlings 
were also common.<p>
Contrasting with the generally low diversity of the upland forest ground cover, was 
a community in a small ravine or temporary stream course. A traverse up this ravine 
yielded in succession the following: <i>Crataegus flabellata,</i>
 <i>Carex platyphylla </i>
confined to the top of a moss-covered down bole,<i> Carex laxiflora</i>
 on the adjacent soil, Small's Ragwort, White Snakeroot, <i>Brachyelytrum</i>
 <i>erectum,</i>
 Barren Strawberry, Enchanter's Nightshade, Wreath Goldenrod, Tall Meadowrue, Horse 
Balm, Great Chickweed, Hog Peanut, Hooked Crowfoot, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Creeping 
Five-leaf, <i>Desmodium glutinosum</i>
, Wild Lily of the Valley on an adjacent bank, Squaw Root, Sugar Maple saplings, Sweet 
White Violet, Spice Bush, Black Cohosh, an agrimony, Blunt-lobed Hepatica, Christmas 
Fern, Maidenhair Fern, New York Fern, Wingstem and Shagbark Hickory. Our traverse 
terminated at a steep bank that revealed deep soil with few rocks. It should be mentioned 
that, although this ravine community reflects richer soils than those of the upland 
forest, it is far from being characteristic of the richest soils and we observed 
no eutrophic indicator species.<p>
As the slope steepened we ascended the wall of the now narrow ravine. Here again we 
saw Mountain Fetterbush and a little Wild Hydrangea, followed just above by Chestnut 
Oak. Also seen here was a single plant of Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<i> Goodyera</i>
 <i>pubescens</i>), Early Low Blueberry, a large Pignut identified as <i>Carya</i>
 <i>glabra</i>
  and Black Oak. Scarlet Tanagers (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>) were heard and spiny woodland spiders seen.<p>
In general a fair contingent of birds was noted by us in this forest, although many 
calls of warblers were doubtless too high-pitched for our ears. Red-eyed Vireos (
<i>Vireo olivaceus </i>) were heard almost constantly and Scarlet Tanager and Ovenbird (<i>Sieurus aurocapillus</i>) calls were frequent except for an early afternoon intermission. A Solitary Vireo 
(<i>Vireo solitarius </i>) was both heard and seen. Woodpeckers of various species, including Pileated (<i>Dryacopus</i>
 <i>pileatus</i>), were heard drumming and calling, particularily in the morning, when White-breasted 
Nuhatches (<i>Sita carolinensis </i>) were also active. A Whip-poor- Will (<i>Caprimulgus vociferus </i>), in a rare appearance, was heard by one of our party who spent the night in the 
vicinity. Other fauna noted in the ancient forest were common large yellow and black 
millipedes with a strong burnt almond odor and a single Peeper Tree Frog (<i>Hyla crucifer</i>) hopping among leaves on the forest floor of the upper slope.<p>
Not many fungi were seen during our May traverses and only the polypores <i>Trichaptum biforme</i>
  and <i>Vavolis alveolaris</i>
  were recorded on dead wood. However, a traverse made on 6-28-98 by R. Hunsucker 
in the ancient forest yielded the following:<p>
<i>Inocybe</i> sp<BR>
<i>Cantherellus cibarius<br></i>
<i>C. xanthopus</i><BR>
<i>Amanita muscaria</i><BR>
<i>A. fulva</i><BR>
<i>A. flavoconia</i><BR>
<i>A. pantherina</i><BR>
<i>A. rubescens</i><BR>
<i>Suillus granulatus</i><BR>
<i>S. pictus</i><BR>
<i>Austroboletus gracilis</i><BR>
<i>Bulgaria inquinans</i><BR>
<i>Cystoderma</i>
 <i>amianthinum</i> var<i> rugosoreticulatum</i><BR>
<i>Xerula radicata</i><BR>
<i>Collybia dryophila</i><BR>
<i>Clitocybe clavipes</i><BR>
<i>C. gibba</i><BR>
<i>C. subclavipes</i><BR>
<i>Xeromphalina tenuipes</i><BR>
<i>Panellus stipticus</i><BR>
<i>Sphathularia velutipes</i><BR>
<i>Bjerkandera adusta</i><BR>
<i>Russula virescens</i><BR>
<i>Lactarius subpurpureus</i><BR>
<i>L. chrysorheus</i><BR>
<i>L. theiogalus</i><p>
Beginning at 10:00 A M of 5-2-98 we conducted an inventory of the bed, first bottom, 
bank and low terrace of the North Fork of Anthony Creek adjacent to the ancient forest. 
The sky was almost clear and conditions pleasant. Tall, though not old, White Pine dominated the canopy. Other trees along the terrace bank were Red and Sugar Maples, 
White Ash, Black Birch, Black Walnut and Tuliptree. River Birch (<i>Betula nigra </i>) and American Elm (<i>Ulmus</i>
 <i>americana</i>) occupied the stream bed/ first bottom. Associated shrubs along the terrace bank 
were Spice Bush, Black Haw Viburnum and Arrowwood Viburnum (<i>Viburnum dentatum</i>). Ninebark (<i>Physocarpus  opulifolius </i>), Smooth Alder (<i>Alnus serrulata)</i>
, Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>) and Silky Willow (<i>Salix sericea </i>) occupied the bed/ first bottom as well as the terrace bank. A few alien Autumn Olive 
(<i>Elaeagnus umbellata</i>) were also seen. Vines noted were Poison Ivy, Hispid Greenbrier and Virgin's Bower 
(<i>Clematis virginiana</i>).<p>
As was true of the woody plants, many herbs found along the Creek were not previously 
encountered in the upland forest. With few exceptions, both common and scientific 
names are provided for these.<p>
Most prominent in the stream channel was the resiliant <i>Carex torta</i>
. Other species within and around the channel were Common Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium fistulosum</i>), Giant Sunflower (<i>Helianthus giganteus</i>), Golden Ragwort in bloom, Grass-leaved Goldenrod (<i> Euthamia graminifolia </i>), a species of the mint <i>Stachys</i>
, Tall Meadowrue, Deer Tongue Grass (<i>Panicum clandestinum</i>), Riparian Wild Rye (<i> Elymus riparius </i>), Virginia Knotweed (<i>Polygonum virginianum </i>), Cleavers (<i>Galium aperine</i>), <i>Carex gracillima</i>
, Downy Wood Violet, the forest bluegrass <i>Poa alsodes,</i>
 Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus </i>), White Grass (<i>Leersia virginica </i>), Hog Peanut, Honewort (<i>Cryptotaenia canadensis </i>), Yellow Sneezeweed (<i>Helenium autumnale</i>), Crooked-stem Aster (<i>Aster</i>
 <i>prenanthoides </i>), White Snakeroot, Wingstem, Enchanter's Nightshade, Indian Turnip, a Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens</i> sp ), Indian Hemp (<i>Apocynum cannabinum </i>), Mad-dog Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria lateriflora </i>), Skunk Cabbage (<i>Symplocarpus foetidus</i>),<i> Carex blanda</i>, Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis </i>), Tall Coneflower (<i>Rudbeckia laciniata </i>), Creeping Five-leaf, Fringed Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia ciliata</i>), Sweet-scented bedstraw, Fowl Manna Grass (Glyceria striata ), Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>), Sweet Vernal Grass (<i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i>), a plantain (<i>Plantago</i>
 sp ),<i> Carex digitalis</i>, Sensitive Fern and Dotted St Johns Wort (<i> Hypericum punctatum</i>). Concentrated on the terrace bank were Indian Tobacco (<i>Lobelia inflata</i>), <i>Carex laxiflora</i>, One-flowered Broomrape (<i>Orobanche uniflora</i>) and an unidentified gentian (<i>Gentiana</i>
 sp ). Much of the east-facing bank was under trees, moss-covered and acidic, with 
abundant Partridge Berry, and in places, the normally high-elevation White Wood Sorrel 
(<i>Oxalis montana</i>). Mosses identified were species of <i>Brachythecium</i>, <i>Mnium</i>
 and <i>Bryoandersonia illicebra</i>, with its distinctive leaves. Accompanying these was the liverwort <i>Conocephalum connicum.</i>
 Fish of undetermined species up to six inches (15 cm ) in length were present in 
the stream.<p>
A second stream-side inventory was done in the early afternoon immediately upstream 
from the junction of the One Mile Run Road. On approaching the stream-side forest 
from the road we noted Striped Violet (<i>Viola striata</i>), the tick-trefoil Desmodium paniculatum and the calls of Scarlet Tanagers and Ovenbirds. 
The forest canopy here consisted of large (2 ft/0.6 m dbh ) White Pine with smaller 
Hemlock. Perhaps as a consequence of heavy needle duff and shade, little ground cover was present under the trees. Present however were Partridge Berry, Round-leaf 
Violet (<i>Viola</i>
 <i>rotundifolia</i>), and in one place there was a single plant of Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphilla maculata</i>), in the only example of this species seen in the entire area.<BR>
In openings and semi-openings and in association with deciduous floodplain trees (except River Birch , which was not seen here ) we saw Wild Hydrangea, White Wood 
Aster, Black Cohosh, Christmas Fern, White Avens (<i>Geum canadense</i>), Common Horsetail (<i>Equisetum arvense</i>), Two-leaved Toothwort (<i>Dentaria diphylla </i>) and the only Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides </i>) seen in the area. In small intervening wetlands we saw <i>Carex  gynandra</i>, Pennsylvania Bittercress (<i>Caramine pensylvanica</i>), Mermaid Weed (<i>Proserpinaca palustris</i>), a burreed (<i>Sparganium  </i>
sp) and the quillwort <i>Isoetes englemanni</i>
 In one place egg masses of a salamander were intergrown with green algae. Also seen 
along the road in this area, and perhaps under its chemical influence, were Purple-stem 
Aster (<i>Aster puniceus </i>), Yellow Sneezeweed, Common Milkweed (<i>Asclepias syriaca </i>), False Nettle (<i>Boehmeria cylindrica</i>), Lady Fern (<i>Athrium filix-femina</i>), Northern Swamp Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus</i>
 <i>septentrionalis </i>), American Germander (<i> Teucrium canadense</i>), <i>Carex laxiflora</i>
  and <i>C. amphibola</i>.<p>
Although the stream in this area has a low gradient, it has a flaggy bed. The contrast 
in the upland and stream-side floras appear to be largely a consequense of moisture 
differences, since few markedly eutrophic species occur in either. Exceptions are 
such species as Striped Violet and Northern Swamp Buttercup, which may however have 
been influnced by road-related nutrients.<p>
