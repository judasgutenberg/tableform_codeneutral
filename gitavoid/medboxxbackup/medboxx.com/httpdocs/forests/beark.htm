<p>Bear Mountain is a 4440 foot (1354 m) swell on the Allegheny Range marking the Virginia-West Virginia line. Although the terrain here is some of the highest in the Central Appalachians, the topography is rounded, subdued and with few rock outcrops. Bedrock in the area of interest is Devonian Hampshire Formation and is dominated by sandstone and siltstone with interbedded shale and mudstone. Soils appear to be generally deep and moderately fertile. Consequently agriculture, and particularly grazing, took hold at an early date and unhappily continues to the present, although some return to forest appears to be occurring.
<p>Laurel Fork is a small north-flowing stream that heads about a mile southeast of the Bear Mountain summit at near 3900 feet (1190 m) asl. Slopes to the southeast of a low saddle divide drain into south-flowing Back Creek.
<p>Several forest types occur in the area, but in general these types appear to be transitional from the Oak-Chestnut type of the Valley and Ridge to the east to the more mesic Allegheny Northern Hardwoods-Spruce type to the west. While Red and Sugar Maples and Northern Red Oak are the most common canopy species, the occurrence of scattered and localized concentrations of Red Spruce indicates that the latter species may have been more abundant relative to the hardwoods in the past than at present, a familiar consequence of logging and fire in the Alleghenies. Indeed, substantial Spruce still occurs along Laurel Fork where it appears to be reproducing and may be favored by abundant moisture, aspect and cool air drainage/accumulation In any case, this particular part of Allegheny Mountain appears to possess a cooler climate than the summit and slopes of Paddy Knob  (4477 ft)  not many miles to the southwest. This may be a consequence of the mean high elevation over an area of about 5 square miles  (13 sq km)  in the vicinity of Bear Mountain compared to the relative isolation of Paddy Knob and other high elevations to the southwest.
<p>Of some interest is the phenology of various species as revealed by comparison of our early and late May observations. Even more significant is the comparison of the onset of leafing-out in 1998 and the more "normal" year 1997 in which it occurred nearly a month later. a phenomenon attributable to the mild El Nino winter in 1998.
<p>Our inventories were done in five distinct areas and three forest types. The first was conducted on the slope that extends from the Endless Mountain Retreat Center at 4200 ft  (1281 m) elevation, to the Allegheny summit. The second extended down-slope from the Center to about 4000 ft  (1220 m)  elevation. Both of these were in northern hardwood dominated by Red Maple and Northern Red Oak with minor Sugar Maple, Beech, Spruce, Hemlock and a few other deciduous species. The third inventory occurred on the southeast slope above Laurel Fork to the north of the Center and was also in northern hardwood, in this case dominated by Sugar Maple. It terminated at the Red Spruce forest along Laurel Fork, where we did our fourth inventory. Our fifth and final inventory occurred in dominantly Chestnut-Oak forest along a low spur and the "Mountain Path".
<p>Conditions in early May were cool and rainy. Leafing-out had begun with swollen buds, some, such as those of Red Maple, an inch in length, and almost a month ahead of the time this stage had been reached in 1997 at a similar elevation a few miles to the north. Also, Smooth Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier laevis</i>) was in full bloom. Few birds except sparrows, Juncos  (Junco hyemalis)  and Towhees (<i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus</i>) were seen or heard.
<p>On our early May inventory the forest canopy above the Retreat Center was bare-branched except for the swollen buds. Aspects here ranged from northeast to southeast. Trees had been thinned a few years previous to our visit on the lower slope, which was dominated by Red Maple. However Northern Red Oak, Black Birch, Black Locust, Sugar Maple and a few Yellow Birch, American Basswood  (some large), Shagbark Hickory and Beech were also noted. Scattered small Red Spruce saplings and the dead remains and sprouts of American Chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>) hinted at an original forest perhaps unlike the present one. Beech was more common on the adjacent steep southeast slope that had been clearcut around a decade ago, and the frequency of Northern Red Oak increased toward the Allegheny summit. Striped Maple, Fire Cherry (<i>Prunus pensylvanica</i>), Smooth Serviceberry, Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana</i>) and Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus</i> sp)  constituted an understory. The dominant shrub under trees was Beaked Hazelnut (<i>Corylus cornuta</i>), while Smooth Gooseberry (<i>Ribes rotundifolium</i>), Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia pilosa</i>), Deer Berry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i>), Upland Low Blueberry (<i>V. pallidum</i>), Early Low Blueberry (<i>V.</i> <i>angustifolium</i>), Flame Azalea (<i>Rhododendron calendulaceum</i>), Rose Azalea (<i>R. roseum</i>), Allegheny Blackberry (<i>Rubus allegheniensis</i>) and Pennsylvania Blackberry (<i>R. pensilvanicus</i>) were concentrated at forest edges and in openings.In early May Early Low Blueberry was already in bloom, whereas the blossoms of the Azaleas and most other shrubs were conspicuous during our late May inventory.
<p>In early May the ground cover under trees consisted almost entirely of the sedge<i>Carex pensylvanica </i>and Wood Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>), with both beginning to bloom. Far less common were a Gall of the Earth (<i>Prenanthes </i>sp),  emerging Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>),  Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex/canadensis</i>),  blooming Thyme-leaved Bluets (<i>Houstonia serpyllifolia</i>) and scattered last season's fronds of Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>).  Patches of Haircap Moss (<i>Polytrichum</i> sp)  were common and on a Red Maple we found the northern moss <i>Ulota crispa</i>.
<p>A few observations were also made in the clearcut on the southeast-facing slope. A soil profile at the upper edge revealed a rich-appearing mull type soil, but down-slope this changed to a sandy mor type. Black Locust, Red Maple, Beech and Northern Red Oak appeared to be abundant as sprouts and saplings, perhaps 10 years in age. Some Sugar Maple was also present and Striped Maple and Witch Hazel were plentiful. Herbs were Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola blanda</i>),  the goldenrod <i>Solidago altissima</i>, Short-leaved Bluegrass (<i>Poa cuspidata</i>) and, at the upper edge, Mountain Oatgrass (<i>Danthonia compressa</i>).  Haircap Moss was common on the mor surface. Slate-colored juncos were seen here in early May.
<p>Additional plants seen on the slope above the Retreat Center in late May were Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>),  then in bloom, Painted Trillium (<i>Trillium undulatum</i>),  Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>),  also in bloom, abundant Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia quadrifolia</i>),  Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana</i>),  Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii</i>) and Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda</i> <i>cinnamomea</i>). 
<p>On 5-30-98 a traverse was made directly up-slope from the Retreat Center. Noted in succession were Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>),  a little stunted May Apple (<i>Podophyllum peltatum</i>),  <i>Carex debilis</i>, Shagbark Hickory, the alien bluegrass <i>Poa annua</i>, Thyme-leaved Bluets, still in bloom, Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis stricta</i>),  also in bloom, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa</i>),  <i>Carex </i>section <i>ovales</i>, and Fire Cherry. Following these were the edible fungus<i>Tricholomopsis platyphylla</i>, the mosses <i>Leucobryum</i> sp, <i>Hypnum</i> sp, <i>Dicranum</i> sp, mostly on soil and dead wood, and <i>Platygyrium repens</i>. on trees. Next seen was that chracteristic herbaceous vine of high elevations, Mountain Bindweed (<i>Polgonum cilinode</i>),  then a <i>Mycena</i> fungus and the alien Sweet Vernal Grass (<i>Anthoxanthum</i> <i>odoratum</i>). As we neared the ridge summit, with fields adjacent to the woods, we encountered increasing numbers of moderately large  (0.5 inch/1.3 cm)  grasshoppers with zebra-striped legs and similar in appearance to those we had seen just below the summit of Spruce Knob in early June of 1994. These were followed by an interesting occurrence of the mosses<i>Ulota crispa</i> and <i>Platygyrium repens</i> ascending the north side of a Sugar Maple trunk nearly to the crown. Here we also caught sight of a Chestnut-sided Warbler (<i>Dendroica pensylvanica</i>) and a Red-backed Salamander (<i>Plethodon cinereus</i>).  We then entered a small grove of Sugar Maple, noting therein the Deer Mushroom (<i>Pluteus cervinus</i>) on dead woody debris, a large slug in an old wood pile and a Solitary Vireo (<i>Vireo solitarius</i>).  As the trail leveled, we noted patches of <i>Brachythecium</i>, <i>Mnium </i>and <i>Polytrichum</i> mosses, the fungus <i>Amanita ceciliae </i>Upland Low Blueberry, the wood rushes <i>Luzula echinata</i> and <i>L. acuminat</i>a and Pennsylvania Blackberry. The canopy here consisted of almost pure Northern Red Oak, some of which had leaves extensively perforated, presumably by some insect.
<p>Birds seen about the Retreat Center in late May were Red-eyed Vireos (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>),  House Wren (<i>Troglodytes aedon</i>),  Towhee, Catbird <i> (Dumatella carolinensis</i>),  Indigo Bunting (<i>Passerina cyanea</i>),  Bluebird (<i>Sialia sialis</i>),  American Robin (<i>Turdus </i> <i>migratorius</i>),  Chipping Sparrow (<i>Spizella passerina</i>),  Chestnut-sided Warbler and Scarlet Tanager (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>).  This incidentally, was the only location in the area the last-named bird was seen or heard! Additionally, Spring Peepers (<i>Hyla crucifer</i>) called loudly each night and other small tree frogs were seen near an artificial pond.
<p>Our 5-5-98 traverse down-slope from the Retreat Center was under threatening clouds and distant thunder, while that of 5-30-98 over essentially the same slope was under warm and sunny conditions. Toward the east on this slope there is a patchwork of open fields, stands of saplings and young to mature forest. A road with interestingly-vegetated banks runs down-slope toward the northeast. The open fields appear to be in the process of being reclaimed by chest-high Deer Berry and low Minnie-bush, Upland Low and Early Low Blueberries. Red Maple is also abundant. In many places the road bank and forest floor were covered by a complex of Clubmosses and acid-loving plants. Included are Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>),  Common Clubmoss (<i>L. clavatum</i>),  Tree Clubmoss (<i>L. obscurum</i>),  a little Slender Ground Pine (<i>L</i>. <i>tristachyum</i>), Round-leaf Pyrola (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia</i>),  Round-leaf Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia</i>),  Sweet White Violet, Wood Anemone, Creeping Five-leaf, <i>Polytrichum</i>, <i>Dicranum</i> and other mosses and lichens, including <i>Baemyces fungoides</i>.
<p> On the more easterly part of the slope, covered by more mature forest, the canopy on the upper slope appeared to be dominated by rather large Northern Red Oak, with numerous saplings of the same. Continuing down-slope, this oak was joined by more Red Maple, Beech, Sugar Maple, scattered Red Spruce, Black and Yellow Birch, with Canada Hemlock in swales. At near 4100 ft  (1250 m) we noted the first Chestnut Oak, which increased in regularity of form and stature down-slope. Striped Maple was particularly abundant and both Smooth and Downy (<i>Amelanchier arborea</i>) Serviceberries were present. Red Spruce saplings, some less than a foot tall, were scattered throughout, and in places there were small stands of Beech or Yellow Birch saplings. It should be noted that, unlike other areas seen by us in the vicinity, Beech here seemed healthy. The dominant shrub here was Mountain Laurel, but all three species of blueberries mentioned earlier were present, and a little Hobblebush (<i>Viburnum alnifolium</i>) was seen blooming in early May. Hemlock saplings were everywhere heavily browsed and seedlings of this tree were scarce.
<p>Herbs seen in this woodland in early May were Wood Anemone, <i>Carex pensylvanica,</i> <i>C. gracillima</i>, <i>C. digitalis</i>, a little stunted May Apple, and beginning at 4100 feet and extendng to lower elevations, Halberd-leaf Violet (<i>Viola hastata</i>) in bloom. It may be that this essentially southern violet is here excluded from the highest elevations. Conspicuous in certain areas were Common and Tree Clubmosses, Ground Pine and a little Shining Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium lucidulum</i>).  Mosses too were well represented by acid-loving species of <i>Dicranum</i>, <i>Leucobryum</i>. <i>Hypnum</i> and <i>Polytrichum</i>. Additional species encountered on our late May traverse were Star Flower (<i>Trientalis borealis</i>) in bloom, in association with Painted Trillium under Hemlock, an <i>Entoloma</i> fungus and a Wolf's Head Slime Mold (<i>Lycogala </i>sp ?). 
<p>On the lower slope our traverse passed through a section of forest with widely-spaced large trees and saplings with little undergrowth. Canopy species here, in addition to oak, were Shagbark Hickory and a 22 inch  (56 cm)  dbh Sugar Maple that was blooming in early May. Ground cover consisted of a dense layer of <i>Carex pensylvanica</i>,  with some Hay-scented Fern, and, in late May Canada Bluegrass (<i>Poa compressa</i>) as well.
<p>Continuing our descent, we noted Black Birch, an <i>Anomodon</i> moss on tree trunks and the small edible fungus Mica Cap (<i>Coprinus</i> <i>micaceus</i>) associated with dead wood on the forest floor. We then reached an area of openings with tall dense clumps of Deer Berry and Smooth Gooseberry at the saddle, where we terminated our traverse.
<p>Few signs of birds were noted but for the call of a Great Crested Flycatcher (<i>Myiarchus crinitus</i>) on our late May traverse.
<p>Our third inventory in northern hardwoods was conducted on the morning of 5-31-98 under high cirrus and pleasantly warm temperatures. Initially passing through open fields along the 4200 ft contour, our traverse descended gradually to lower elevations and ended at the spruce forest along Laurel Fork. Aspect for the most part was southeast. In the following narration species and terrain features are discussed in the order in which they were encountered.
<p>As we entered the forest, the canopy was dominated by Sugar Maple but with varying amounts of Black Birch, Black Locust, Red Maple and Northern Red Oak. Dotted Thorn (<i>Crataegus punctata</i>) was the sole understory species seen here. As we penetrated farther we noted Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda claytoniana</i>), <i>Carex debilis, C</i>. <i>laxiflora</i>, <i>C, pensylvanica</i> Wood Anemone, Hay-scented Fern, a few stunted plants of May Apple, Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>),  Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium filix-femina</i>) and large woody debris of American Chestnut. We now entered an area of almost pure Sugar Maple canopy, but with a little Beech and a ground flora of Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia sessilifolia</i>),  Curtis Goldenrod, Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>),  the fungus <i>Collybia dryophylla</i>, White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium rugosum</i>),  <i>Potentilla simplex</i>,  and under Sugar Maple, Round-leaf Violet. A Red-eyed Vireo here sounded one of the few bird calls of the traverse. Following these we saw Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>) and the northern forest bluegrass <i>Poa</i> <i>alsodes,</i> while Striped Maple began to become conspicuous in the understory.
<p>Notable features of this forest were the scarcity of the Sugar Maple seedlings that frequently are abundant in northern forests, the sparse ground flora and apparent lack of diversity in this flora. However there were some large patches of ferns, chiefly Hay-scented and New York but also some Lady and Intermediate Shield Ferns. Next seen were Giant Chickweed (<i>Stellaria pubera</i>),  Sweet White Violet and a <i>Mycena</i> fungus. Although few mosses were generally visible, species of <i>Dicranum</i>, <i>Hypnum</i> and other species occurred on woody debris, while <i>Platygyrium repens</i> was seen on the base of a Sugar Maple.
<p>Another feature of some significance was the heavy leaf mat in this maple-dominated forest, since maple leaves generally decay rapidly. This mat, with a depth of perhaps 4 inches  (10 cm),  may have resulted from low temperatures restricting decay. It may have played a role in the sparse herb cover. However, the soil beneath the leaf mat appeared to be a rich, dark clay loam, stony, but with few large rocks.
<p>As we continued our gradual descent we saw <i>Carex digitalis</i>, either Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>) or White Baneberry (<i>Actaea pachypoda</i>),  Alpine Enchanters Nightshade (<i>Circaea alpina</i>),  and, not far beyond these, a Red-backed Salamander. These were followed by the fungus <i>Tricholomopsis platyphylla</i>, abundant Hay-scented Fern, <i>Medeola</i>, a rare outcrop of sandstone, Halberd-leaf Violet at near the same elevation it was found at on the previously inventoried slope, then the call of a Red-eyed Vireo and a single plant of Large Round-leaf Orchid (<i>Habenaria orbiculata</i>),  always a sign of cool growing conditions. Also seen was an unidentified Trillium we had seen previously along this slope, but of which we could only say that it was not Painted Trillium.
<p>We now entered an area of many Sugar Maple saplings in what was probably once an open field. Also seen here was <i>Carex digitalis,</i> a Deer Mushroom, a Large Cucumbertree and a small grove of Northern Red Oak with the appearance of Black Oak, except for certain features of the leaves and old acorn caps found in the vicinity. Also observed on a number of Northern Red Oak on this slope were large, usually healed, cracks extending from near the base to perhaps ten feet  (3 m)  up the trunk, a feature likely the result of frost action. However few fire scars were seen on this slope, which may have been a consequence of the relatively high moisture conditions and/or the long agricultural history of the area with associated fire suppression in the discontinuous forest cover. 
<p>On arriving at the base of the slope and at a shallow ravine, we entered a small grove of very large and presumably old Sugar Maple that had been preserved for sugar production. Before leaving this grove we observed "Dead Man's Fingers" (<i>Xylaria polymorpha</i>),  a fungus characteristic of dead wood of Beech and Maple  (Phillips,1991).  Our further progress took us across the largely open ravine and a small dry watercourse marked by a dense growth of the large sedge <i>Carex scabrata</i>. Here also we noted a fire scar on a large Sugar Maple before ascending a low spur. This minor spur, which overlooks the head of Laurel Fork, was covered by a degraded forest with a canopy of Northern Red Oak, Hemlock, White Pine  (likely planted)  and Beech, with the last-named species of relatively healthy appearance compared to what we were to see below. At this forest edge was a hawthorn, a <i>Crataegus flabellata</i>, in full bloom.
<p>We began our final descent to Laurel Fork through a canopy of Beech, Sugar and Red Maples, Black Birch and some Northern Red and Chestnut Oaks. On this slope we saw many signs of what appeared to be Beech Scale (<i>Cryptococcus fagi</i>) and the associated fungus <i>Nectria coccinea</i> var <i>faginata</i>, which form the Scale-<i>Nectria </i>complex that is the most serious pathogen of American Beech. As we descended we saw more and more Beech with large lesions, cracks and dead branches, as well as large dead trees in the most extensive case of this calamity seen by us in these mountains thus far. On a more cheerful note, also seen here was a fine large Red Salamander (<i>Pseudotriton ruber</i>) in damp leaves under a down bole. This salamander Is said to be increasingly rare in the region. As we descended farther we began to see considerable diseased and dead Black Birch with lesions at the base, an unusual occurrence not seen previously by us on our inventories. Near the bottom of the slope we also began to see Yellow Birch and Red Spruce.

<p>Laurel Fork is here interrupted by a number of Beaver dams with associated lodges. Most of the Spruce appears to be distributed along the southeast side of the stream where in places it forms dense stands. Associated canopy species are Red Maple, Yellow and Black Birch, Hemlock, Beech and Northern Red Oak. Smooth Serviceberry and Mountain Holly are understory species, while a high shrub layer is formed by Great and Catawba Rhododendrons (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i> and <i>R. catawbiense</i>) and Mountain Laurel. Mountain Laurel here was heavily browsed, perhaps as a consequence of winter deer yarding. Other shrubs found by us, mostly on the periphery of the Spruce, were Maleberry (<i>Lyonia ligustrina</i>),  Minnie-bush, Deerberry, Early Low Blueberry, Sourtop Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtilloides</i>) and Glade St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum densiflorum</i>).  Herbs identified on our brief visits were Canada Mayflower, Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>),  Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigaea repens</i>),  Filmy Angelica (<i>Angelica triquinata</i>),  Thyme-leaved Bluets  (blooming in early May),  Hay-scented and Intermediate Shield Ferns, Tree Clubmoss and, unusual for Virginia, Stiff Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium annotinum</i>).  <i>Carex stipata, C. scabrata</i> and a manna grass (<i>Glyceria</i> sp)  were associated with a springbrook. Liverworts were represented by, among others, that characteristic species of spruce forests, <i>Bazzania trilobata</i>, as well as the more widespread inhabitant of rotting down wood, <i>Nowellia curvifolia</i>. Associated mosses included species of Haircap (<i>Polytrichum</i>),  <i>Leucobryum glaucum</i>, various species of <i>Hypnum</i> and <i>Hylocomium brevirostre</i>. Of particular interest was the presence of first year seedlings of Red Spruce, since these, with larger seedlings and saplings, are evidence of reproductive continuity. In many cases these one-cm high seedlings were observed with birch seedlings growing from patches of <i>Polytrichum</i> and other mosses, but they also occurred in the open on organic and mineral soils  (see photo). 
<p>Fauna of the Spruce forest included calling Green Frogs (<i>Rana clamitans</i>),  Dusky Salamanders (<i>Desmognathus fuscus</i>) and a Mudpuppy  (Necturus maculosus),  all associated with springbrooks. The Northern Flying Squirrel (<i>Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus</i>) has been observed by others.
<p>While the Spruce forest is young-perhaps 70 years in age-and small, with a main distribution of eleven acres- it is of outstanding quality. The growth is dense and the trees well-formed and tall, with vigorous sapling growth in openings and a diversely-structured shrub layer. On our late May visit flamboyant lavender blossoms of Catawba Rhododendron further graced the scene. Although Red Spruce is at the eastern fringe of its distribution here, it is clear that the tree thrives at this particular location, which also favors such unfamiliar Virginia species as Stiff Clubmoss and Sourtop Blueberry. It seems possible that more rare and disjunct species may occur, favored by a combination of elevation, air drainage/accumulation, aspect and moisture. The vigorous growth of this Spruce here contrasts with its squat, stunted form at near the same elevation on Sounding Knob a little to the east. The latter site, also inventoried by us, is the easternmost outpost of the species at this latitude in the Valley and Ridge and, unlike the Laurel Fork forest. is on an exposed mountain slope. The location of such forest tracts at the very edge of their ranges gives them particular value in baseline studies of climate change and anthropogenic effects.
<p>Lying to the southeast of the head of Laurel Fork and the Spruce forest, the saddle area is at an elevation of near 3950 feet  (1205 m) asl. The generally mesic forest here is marked by a magnificent Shagbark Hickory remnant in an open field. A woods road  (leading to a log landing)  and its continuation, the " Mountain Path " Trail extend southeast along a low mountain spur. Here we saw a Red Eft of the Eastern Newt (<i>Notophthalmus viridescens</i>) in the road. A large clearcut  (perhaps the same observed at the Retreat Center)  occurs on the southwest slope occupied by the mesic forest. Along the Mountain Path there is a gradual transition from the mesic forest to a xeric, ericaceous Oak- Chestnut type. In the transition zone we observed the first White Oak seen by us in the entire area. Accompanying canopy species were Northern Red Oak, Black Oak, Pignut Hickory of undetermined species, Red and Sugar Maples and progressively more Chestnut Oak as we advanced along the trail. Also present were scattered Hemlock and a few Red Spruce saplings. American Chestnut sprouts were common. Striped Maple and Hophornbeam were the most frequent understory species, but Downy Serviceberry and Fire Cherry were also present. Shrubs included Witch Hazel, abundant Deer Berry and, as we progressed, increasing Mountain Laurel and Black Huckleberry (<i>Gaylussacia baccata</i>).  Here also, in late May, Rose Azalea was in bloom.
<p>Herbs seen in the more mesic part of the forest were Plume Lily, Common Many Knees or Solomon's Seal  (Po<i>lygonatum biflorum</i>) and Curtis Goldenrod. These were followed by increasing frequencies of Trailing Arbutus, Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>),  Gay Wings (<i>Polygalla paucifolia</i>),  Moccasin Flower (<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>) in bloom and abundant cushions of<i>Leucobryum</i> moss as we entered the Oak-Chestnut forest  (Braun 1950).  Many trees in this forest had their bases heavily covered by bryophytes and lichens. Some taxa identified in the field on the base of a large Hemlock were the mosses <i>Rhodobryum roseum</i>, species of <i>Leucobryum</i> and <i>Neckera</i>, the leafy liverwort <i>Porella</i> and <i>Cladina</i> lichen. A microscopic study by R. Hunsucker of bryophytes on the base of a Chestnut Oak revealed the mosses<i>Dicranum viride</i>, <i>Haplohymanium triste</i>, <i>Thelia asprella</i>, <i>Campylium chrysophyllum</i>, <i>Platygyrium epens</i>,<i>Brotherella recurvans</i>, <i>Anomodon rostratus </i>and <i>Tortella humilis</i>, in association with the liverwort<i>Frullania asagrayana</i>.
<p>Few birds were seen or heard in this forest. However Wood Thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustelina</i>) and Ovenbird (<i>Seiurus aurocapillus</i>) calls were heard in the early May traverse. But these calls appeared to originate from the more mesic part of the forest at a lower elevation.
<p>It should also be mentioned that somewhere here the Trail enters the George Washington National Forest.
<p>At an elevation of perhaps 3700 feet  (1129 m)  asl the Mountain Path traverses the top of a steep northeast-facing slope. Here the forest again undergoes a transformation to a more mesic type. Although dominated by Northern Red Oak, Sugar Maple, Shagbark Hickory and Striped Maple were common and no ericaceae were seen. Herbs were sparse but some <i>Carex laxiflora </i>and Black Cohosh were seen. In one place a little Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>) was associated with a rare outcrop of sandstone and not far beyond numerous tiny Rove Beetles were seen on a fungus.
<p>As the trail again followed the spur summit we entered a grove of large Hemlock saplings under which grew Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i>) and abundant Rattlesnake Weed (<i>Hieracium </i> <i>venosum</i>).  Continuing our descent along the spur, we again entered an area of ericaceous oak forest. Here we came upon a few plants of the rather uncommon grass <i>Calamagrostis porteri </i>as well as Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>).  Finally we reached a clump of a few somewhat decadent Pitch and Table Mountain Pines, accompanied in late May by Mountain Laurel in the last stages of flowering. Also found here was a small Garter Snake (<i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>) that exhibited its characteristic unpleasant odor on disturbance. Here we terminated our traverse at near 3500 feet  (1068 m) asl.
