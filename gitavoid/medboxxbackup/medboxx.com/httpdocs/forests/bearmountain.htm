<p>Bear Mountain is a 4440 foot (1354 m) swell on the
Allegheny Range marking the Virginia-West Virginia line. Although the terrain
here is some of the highest in the Central Appalachians, the topography is
rounded, subdued and with few rock outcrops. Bedrock in the area of interest is
Devonian Hampshire Formation and is dominated by sandstone and siltstone with
interbedded shale and mudstone. Soils appear to be generally deep and
moderately fertile. Consequently agriculture, and particularly grazing, took
hold at an early date and unhappily continues to the present, although some
return to forest appears to be occurring.
<p> Laurel Fork is a small north-flowing stream that
heads about a mile southeast of the Bear Mountain summit at near 3900 feet(
1190 m) asl. Slopes to the southeast of a low saddle divide drain into
south-flowing Back Creek.
<p> Several forest types occur in the area, but in general
these types appear to be transitional from the Oak-Chestnut type of the Valley
and Ridge to the east to the more mesic Allegheny Northern Hardwoods-Spruce
type to the west. While Red and Sugar Maples and Northern Red Oak are the most
common canopy species, the occurrence of scattered and localized concentrations
of Red Spruce indicates that the latter species may have been more abundant
relative to the hardwoods in the past than at present, a familiar consequence
of logging and fire in the Alleghenies. Indeed, substantial Spruce still occurs
along Laurel Fork where it appears to be reproducing and may be favored by
abundant moisture, aspect and cool air drainage/accumulation In any case, this
particular part of Allegheny Mountain appears to possess a cooler climate than
the summit and slopes of Paddy Knob (4477 ft) not many miles to the
southwest. This may be a consequence of the mean high elevation over an area of
about 5 square miles (13 sq km) in the vicinity of Bear Mountain compared to
the relative isolation of Paddy Knob and other high elevations to the
southwest.
<p> Of some interest is the phenology of various species
as revealed by comparison of our early and late May observations. Even more
significant is the comparison of the onset of leafing-out in 1998 and the more
&quot;normal&quot; year 1997 in which it occurred nearly a month later. a
phenomenon attributable to the mild El Nino winter in 1998.
<p> Our inventories were done in five distinct areas and
three forest types. The first was conducted on the slope that extends from the
Endless Mountain Retreat Center at 4200 ft (1281 m) elevation, to the
Allegheny summit. The second extended down-slope from the Center to about 4000
ft (1220 m) elevation. Both of these were in northern hardwood dominated by Red
Maple and Northern Red Oak with minor Sugar Maple, Beech, Spruce, Hemlock and a
few other deciduous species. The third inventory occurred on the southeast
slope above Laurel Fork to the north of the Center and was also in northern
hardwood, in this case dominated by Sugar Maple. It terminated at the Red
Spruce forest along Laurel Fork, where we did our fourth inventory. Our fifth
and final inventory occurred in dominantly Chestnut-Oak forest along a low spur
and the &quot;Mountain Path&quot;.
<p> Conditions in early May were cool and rainy.
Leafing-out had begun with swollen buds, some, such as those of Red Maple, an
inch in length, and almost a month ahead of the time this stage had been
reached in 1997 at a similar elevation a few miles to the north. Also, Smooth Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier laevis</i>) was in full bloom.
Few birds except sparrows, Juncos (<i>Junco hyemalis</i>) and Towhees (<i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus</i>) were seen or
heard.
<p> On our early May inventory the forest canopy above
the Retreat Center was bare-branched except for the swollen buds. Aspects here
ranged from northeast to southeast. Trees had been thinned a few years previous
to our visit on the lower slope, which
was dominated by Red Maple. However Northern Red Oak, Black Birch, Black
Locust, Sugar Maple and a few Yellow Birch, American Basswood (some large),
Shagbark Hickory and Beech were also noted. Scattered small Red Spruce
saplings and the dead remains and sprouts of American Chestnut (<i>Castanea 
dentata</i>) hinted at an original forest perhaps unlike the present
one. Beech was more common on the
adjacent steep southeast slope that had been clearcut around a decade ago, and
the frequency of Northern Red Oak increased toward the Allegheny summit.
Striped Maple, Fire Cherry (<i>Prunus pensylvanica</i>), Smooth Serviceberry,
Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana</i>) and
Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus</i> sp) constituted an understory. The dominant
shrub under trees was Beaked Hazelnut (<i>Corylus cornuta</i>), while Smooth Gooseberry (<i>Ribes 
rotundifolium</i>), Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia
pilosa</i>), Deer Berry (<i>Vaccinium
stamineum</i>), Upland Low Blueberry (<i>V.
pallidum</i>), Early Low Blueberry (<i>V.</i>
<i>angustifolium</i>), Flame Azalea (<i>Rhododendron calendulaceum</i>), Rose Azalea
(<i>R. roseum</i>), Allegheny Blackberry (<i>Rubus allegheniensis</i>) and Pennsylvania
Blackberry (<i>R. pensilvanicus</i>) were
concentrated at forest edges and in openings.In early May Early Low Blueberry
was already in bloom, whereas the blossoms of the Azaleas and most other shrubs
were conspicuous during our late May inventory.
<p> In early May the ground cover under trees consisted
almost entirely of the sedge <i>Carex pensylvanica</i> and Wood Anemone (<i>Anemone
quinquefolia</i>), with both beginning to bloom. Far less common were a Gall of
the Earth (<i>Prenanthes </i>sp), emerging Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>), Creeping
Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex/canadensis
</i>), blooming Thyme-leaved Bluets (<i>Houstonia
serpyllifolia</i>) and scattered last season's fronds of Intermediate Shield
Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>). 
Patches of Haircap Moss (<i>Polytrichum</i> sp) were common and on a Red Maple we found
the northern moss <i>Ulota crispa</i>.
<p> A few observations were also made in the clearcut on
the southeast-facing slope. A soil profile at the upper edge revealed a
rich-appearing mull type soil, but down-slope this changed to a sandy mor type.
Black Locust, Red Maple, Beech and Northern Red Oak appeared to be abundant as
sprouts and saplings, perhaps 10 years in age. Some Sugar Maple was also
present and Striped Maple and Witch Hazel were plentiful. Herbs were Sweet White
Violet (<i>Viola blanda</i>), the
goldenrod <i>Solidago altissima</i>,
Short-leaved Bluegrass (<i>Poa cuspidata</i>
) and, at the upper edge, Mountain Oatgrass (<i>Danthonia compressa</i>).  Haircap Moss was common on the mor surface.
Slate-colored juncos were seen here in early May.
<p> Additional plants seen on the slope above the Retreat
Center in late May were Canada Mayflower (<i>
Maianthemum canadense</i>), then in
bloom, Painted Trillium (<i>Trillium undulatum</i>), Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>), also in bloom,
abundant Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia quadrifolia</i>), Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola 
virginiana</i>), Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii</i>) and Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda</i> <i>cinnamomea</i>). 
<p> On 5-30-98 a traverse was made directly up-slope from
the Retreat Center. Noted in succession were Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea 
quaternata</i>), a little stunted May Apple (<i>Podophyllum peltatum</i>), <i>Carex debilis</i>, Shagbark Hickory, the
alien bluegrass <i>Poa annua</i>, Thyme-leaved Bluets, still in
bloom, Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis
stricta</i>), also in bloom, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa</i>), <i>Carex </i>section <i>ovales</i>, and Fire Cherry. Following these were the edible fungus<i>Tricholomopsis platyphylla</i>, the mosses <i>Leucobryum</i> sp, <i>Hypnum</i> sp, <i>Dicranum</i> sp, 
mostly on soil and dead wood, and <i>Platygyrium
repens</i>. on trees. Next seen was that chracteristic herbaceous vine of high
elevations, Mountain Bindweed (<i>Polgonum
cilinode</i>), then a <i>Mycena</i> fungus and the alien Sweet Vernal Grass (<i>Anthoxanthum</i> <i>odoratum</i>). As we neared the ridge summit, with fields adjacent to
the woods, we encountered increasing numbers of moderately large (0.5 inch/1.3
cm) grasshoppers with zebra-striped legs and similar in appearance to those we
had seen just below the summit of Spruce Knob in early June of 1994. These were
followed by an interesting occurrence of the mosses<i>Ulota crispa</i> and <i>Platygyrium 
repens</i> ascending the north
side of a Sugar Maple trunk nearly to the crown. Here we also caught sight of a
Chestnut-sided Warbler (<i>Dendroica
pensylvanica</i>) and a Red-backed Salamander (<i>Plethodon cinereus</i>).  We
then entered a small grove of Sugar Maple, noting therein the Deer Mushroom (<i>Pluteus 
cervinus</i>) on dead woody debris, a large slug in an old wood pile
and a Solitary Vireo (<i>Vireo solitarius</i>).  As the trail leveled, we
noted patches of <i>Brachythecium</i>, <i>Mnium 
</i>and <i>Polytrichum</i> mosses, the fungus <i>Amanita ceciliae </i>Upland Low
Blueberry, the wood rushes <i>Luzula
echinata</i> and <i>L. acuminat</i>a and Pennsylvania Blackberry. The canopy here consisted
of almost pure Northern Red Oak, some of which had leaves extensively
perforated, presumably by some insect.
<p> Birds seen about the Retreat Center in late May were
Red-eyed Vireos (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>), 
House Wren (<i>Troglodytes aedon</i>), Towhee, Catbird <i> (Dumatella 
carolinensis</i>), Indigo Bunting (<i>Passerina
cyanea</i>), Bluebird (<i>Sialia sialis</i>), American Robin (<i>Turdus migratorius</i>), Chipping
Sparrow (<i>Spizella passerina</i>), 
Chestnut-sided Warbler and Scarlet Tanager (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>).  This
incidentally, was the only location in the area the last-named bird was seen or
heard! Additionally, Spring Peepers (<i>Hyla
crucifer</i>) called loudly each night and other small tree frogs were seen
near an artificial pond.
<p> Our 5-5-98 traverse down-slope from the Retreat
Center was under threatening clouds and distant thunder, while that of 5-30-98
over essentially the same slope was under warm and sunny conditions. Toward the
east on this slope there is a patchwork of open fields, stands of saplings and
young to mature forest. A road with interestingly-vegetated banks runs
down-slope toward the northeast. The open fields appear to be in the process of
being reclaimed by chest-high Deer Berry and low Minnie-bush, Upland Low and
Early Low Blueberries. Red Maple is also abundant. In many places the road bank
and forest floor were covered by a complex of Clubmosses and acid-loving
plants. Included are Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium
flabelliforme</i>), Common Clubmoss (<i>L.
clavatum</i>), Tree Clubmoss (<i>L.
obscurum</i>), a little Slender Ground Pine 
(<i>L</i>.
<i>tristachyum</i>),Round-leaf Pyrola (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia</i>), 
Round-leaf Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia</i>), Sweet White Violet, 
Wood Anemone, Creeping Five-leaf, <i>Polytrichum</i>, <i>Dicranum</i> and
other mosses and lichens, including <i>Baemyces
fungoides</i>.
<p> On the more
easterly part of the slope, covered by more mature forest, the canopy on the
upper slope appeared to be dominated by rather large Northern Red Oak, with
numerous saplings of the same. Continuing down-slope, this oak was joined by
more Red Maple, Beech, Sugar Maple, scattered Red Spruce, Black and Yellow
Birch, with Canada Hemlock in swales. At near 4100 ft (1250 m) we noted the
first Chestnut Oak, which increased in regularity of form and stature
down-slope. Striped Maple was particularly abundant and both Smooth and Downy (
<i>Amelanchier arborea</i>) Serviceberries
were present. Red Spruce saplings, some less than a foot tall, were scattered
throughout, and in places there were small stands of Beech or Yellow Birch
saplings. It should be noted that, unlike other areas seen by us in the
vicinity, Beech here seemed healthy. The dominant shrub here was Mountain
Laurel, but all three species of blueberries mentioned earlier were present,
and a little Hobblebush (<i>Viburnum
alnifolium</i>) was seen blooming in early May. Hemlock saplings were
everywhere heavily browsed and seedlings of this tree were scarce.
<p> Herbs seen in this woodland in early May were Wood
Anemone, <i>Carex pensylvanica,</i> <i>C. gracillima</i>, <i>C. digitalis</i>, a little stunted May Apple, and beginning at 4100
feet and extendng to lower elevations, Halberd-leaf Violet (<i>Viola hastata</i>) in bloom. It may be that
this essentially southern violet is here excluded from the highest elevations.
Conspicuous in certain areas were Common and Tree Clubmosses, Ground Pine and a
little Shining Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium
lucidulum</i>).  Mosses too were well represented by acid-loving species of <i>Dicranum</i>, <i>Leucobryum</i>. <i>Hypnum</i> and <i>Polytrichum</i>. Additional species
encountered on our late May traverse were Star Flower (<i>Trientalis borealis</i>) in bloom, in association with Painted
Trillium under Hemlock, an <i>Entoloma</i> fungus and a Wolf's Head Slime Mold (<i>Lycogala 
</i>sp ?). 
<p> On the lower slope our traverse passed through a
section of forest with widely-spaced large trees and saplings with little
undergrowth. Canopy species here, in addition to oak, were Shagbark Hickory and
a 22 inch (56 cm) dbh Sugar Maple that was blooming in early May. Ground
cover consisted of a dense layer of <i>Carex
pensylvanica</i>, with some Hay-scented Fern, and, in late May Canada
Bluegrass (<i>Poa compressa</i>) as well.
<p> Continuing our descent, we noted Black Birch, an <i>Anomodon</i> moss on tree trunks and the
small edible fungus Mica Cap (<i>Coprinus</i>
<i>micaceus</i>) associated with dead wood
on the forest floor. We then reached an area of openings with tall dense clumps
of Deer Berry and Smooth Gooseberry at the saddle, where we terminated our
traverse.
<p> Few signs of birds were noted but for the call of a
Great Crested Flycatcher (<i>Myiarchus crinitus</i>) on our late May traverse.
<p> Our third inventory in northern hardwoods was
conducted on the morning of 5-31-98 under high cirrus and pleasantly warm
temperatures. Initially passing through open fields along the 4200 ft contour,
our traverse descended gradually to lower elevations and ended at the spruce
forest along Laurel Fork. Aspect for the most part was southeast. In the
following narration species and terrain features are discussed in the order in
which they were encountered.
<p> As we entered the forest, the canopy was dominated by
Sugar Maple but with varying amounts of Black Birch, Black Locust, Red Maple
and Northern Red Oak. Dotted Thorn (<i>Crataegus punctata</i>) was the sole understory
species seen here. As we penetrated farther we noted Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda claytoniana</i>), <i>Carex debilis, C</i>. <i>laxiflora</i>, <i>C, pensylvanica</i>
Wood Anemone, Hay-scented Fern, a few stunted plants of May Apple, Indian
Turnip (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>), Lady
Fern (<i>Athyrium filix-femina</i>) and
large woody debris of American Chestnut. We now entered an area of almost pure
Sugar Maple canopy, but with a little Beech and a ground flora of
Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia
sessilifolia</i>), Curtis Goldenrod, Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>), the fungus <i>Collybia
dryophylla</i>, White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium
rugosum</i>), <i>Potentilla simplex</i>, 
and under Sugar Maple, Round-leaf Violet. A Red-eyed Vireo here sounded one of
the few bird calls of the traverse. Following these we saw Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>) and the northern
forest bluegrass <i>Poa</i> <i>alsodes,</i> while Striped Maple began to
become conspicuous in the understory.
<p> Notable features of this forest were the scarcity of
the Sugar Maple seedlings that frequently are abundant in northern forests, the
sparse ground flora and apparent lack of diversity in this flora. However there
were some large patches of ferns, chiefly Hay-scented and New York but also
some Lady and Intermediate Shield Ferns. Next seen were Giant Chickweed (<i>Stellaria pubera</i>), Sweet White Violet
and a <i>Mycena</i> fungus. Although few mosses were generally
visible, species of <i>Dicranum</i>, <i>Hypnum</i> and other species occurred on
woody debris, while <i>Platygyrium repens</i> was seen on the base of a Sugar Maple.
<p> Another feature of some significance was the heavy
leaf mat in this maple-dominated forest, since maple leaves generally decay
rapidly. This mat, with a depth of perhaps 4 inches (10 cm), may have
resulted from low temperatures restricting decay. It may have played a role in
the sparse herb cover. However, the soil beneath the leaf mat appeared to be a
rich, dark clay loam, stony, but with few large rocks.
<p> As we continued our gradual descent we saw <i>Carex digitalis</i>, either Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>) or White Baneberry
(<i>Actaea pachypoda</i>), Alpine
Enchanters Nightshade (<i>Circaea alpina</i>
), and, not far beyond these, a Red-backed Salamander. These were followed by
the fungus <i>Tricholomopsis platyphylla</i>,
abundant Hay-scented Fern, <i>Medeola</i>, a
rare outcrop of sandstone, Halberd-leaf Violet at near the same elevation it
was found at on the previously inventoried slope, then the call of a Red-eyed
Vireo and a single plant of Large Round-leaf Orchid (<i>Habenaria orbiculata</i>), always a sign of cool growing conditions.
Also seen was an unidentified Trillium we had seen previously along this slope,
but of which we could only say that it was not Painted Trillium.
<p> We now entered an area of many Sugar Maple saplings
in what was probably once an open field. Also seen here was <i>Carex digitalis,</i> a Deer Mushroom, a
Large Cucumbertree and a small grove of Northern Red Oak with the appearance of
Black Oak, except for certain features of the leaves and old acorn caps found
in the vicinity. Also observed on a number of Northern Red Oak on this slope
were large, usually healed, cracks extending from near the base to perhaps ten
feet (3 m) up the trunk, a feature likely the result of frost action. However
few fire scars were seen on this slope, which may have been a consequence of
the relatively high moisture conditions and/or the long agricultural history of
the area with associated fire suppression in the discontinuous forest cover. 
<p> On arriving at the base of the slope and at a shallow
ravine, we entered a small grove of very large and presumably old Sugar Maple
that had been preserved for sugar production. Before leaving this grove we
observed &quot;Dead Man's Fingers&quot; (<i>Xylaria
polymorpha</i>), a fungus characteristic of dead wood of Beech and Maple (
Phillips,1991).  Our further progress took us across the largely open ravine
and a small dry watercourse marked by a dense growth of the large sedge <i>Carex scabrata</i>. Here also we noted a
fire scar on a large Sugar Maple before ascending a low spur. This minor spur,
which overlooks the head of Laurel Fork, was covered by a degraded forest with
a canopy of Northern Red Oak, Hemlock, White Pine (likely planted) and Beech,
with the last-named species of relatively healthy appearance compared to what
we were to see below. At this forest edge was a hawthorn, a <i>Crataegus flabellata</i>, in full bloom.
<p> We began our final descent to Laurel Fork through a
canopy of Beech, Sugar and Red Maples,
Black Birch and some Northern Red and Chestnut Oaks. On this slope we saw many
signs of what appeared to be Beech Scale (<i>Cryptococcus
fagi</i>) and the associated fungus <i>Nectria
coccinea</i> var <i>faginata</i>, which form
the Scale-<i>Nectria </i>complex that is the
most serious pathogen of American Beech. As we descended we saw more and more
Beech with large lesions, cracks and dead branches, as well as large dead trees
in the most extensive case of this calamity seen by us in these mountains thus
far. On a more cheerful note, also seen here was a fine large Red Salamander (<i>Pseudotriton ruber</i>) in damp leaves
under a down bole. This salamander Is
said to be increasingly rare in the region. As we descended farther we began to
see considerable diseased and dead Black Birch with lesions at the base, an
unusual occurrence not seen previously by us on our inventories. Near the
bottom of the slope we also began to see Yellow Birch and Red Spruce.
<p> Laurel Fork is here interrupted by a number of Beaver
dams with associated lodges. Most of the Spruce appears to be distributed along
the southeast side of the stream where in places it forms dense stands.
Associated canopy species are Red Maple, Yellow and Black Birch, Hemlock, Beech
and Northern Red Oak. Smooth Serviceberry and Mountain Holly are understory
species, while a high shrub layer is formed by Great and Catawba Rhododendrons
(<i>Rhododendron maximum</i> and <i>R. catawbiense</i>) and Mountain Laurel.
Mountain Laurel here was heavily browsed, perhaps as a consequence of winter
deer yarding. Other shrubs found by us, mostly on the periphery of the Spruce,
were Maleberry (<i>Lyonia ligustrina</i>), 
Minnie-bush, Deerberry, Early Low Blueberry, Sourtop Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtilloides</i>) and Glade St.
Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum densiflorum</i>). 
Herbs identified on our brief visits were Canada Mayflower, Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>), Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigaea repens</i>), Filmy Angelica (<i>Angelica triquinata</i>), Thyme-leaved
Bluets (blooming in early May), Hay-scented and Intermediate Shield Ferns,
Tree Clubmoss and, unusual for Virginia, Stiff Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium annotinum</i>).  <i>Carex
stipata, C. scabrata</i> and a manna grass (<i>Glyceria</i> sp) were
associated with a springbrook. Liverworts were represented by, among others,
that characteristic species of spruce forests, <i>Bazzania trilobata</i>, as well as the more widespread inhabitant of
rotting down wood, <i>Nowellia curvifolia</i>.
Associated mosses included species of Haircap (<i>Polytrichum</i>), <i>Leucobryum
glaucum</i>, various species of <i>Hypnum</i> and <i>Hylocomium
brevirostre</i>. Of particular interest was the presence of first year
seedlings of Red Spruce, since these, with larger seedlings and saplings, are
evidence of reproductive continuity. In many cases these one-cm high seedlings
were observed with birch seedlings growing from patches of <i>Polytrichum</i> and other
mosses, but they also occurred in the open on organic and mineral soils (see
photo). 
<p> Fauna of the Spruce forest included calling Green
Frogs (<i>Rana clamitans</i>), Dusky
Salamanders (<i>Desmognathus fuscus</i>) 
and a Mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus), all associated with springbrooks. The
Northern Flying Squirrel (<i>Glaucomys
sabrinus fuscus</i>) has been observed by others.
<p> While the Spruce forest is young-perhaps 70 years in
age-and small, with a main distribution of eleven acres- it is of outstanding
quality. The growth is dense and the trees well-formed and tall, with vigorous
sapling growth in openings and a diversely-structured shrub layer. On our late
May visit flamboyant lavender blossoms of Catawba Rhododendron further graced
the scene. Although Red Spruce is at the eastern fringe of its distribution
here, it is clear that the tree thrives at this particular location, which also
favors such unfamiliar Virginia species as Stiff Clubmoss and Sourtop Blueberry.
It seems possible that more rare and disjunct species may occur, favored by a
combination of elevation, air drainage/accumulation, aspect and moisture. The
vigorous growth of this Spruce here contrasts with its squat, stunted form at
near the same elevation on Sounding Knob a little to the east. The latter site,
also inventoried by us, is the easternmost outpost of the species at this
latitude in the Valley and Ridge and, unlike the Laurel Fork forest. is on an
exposed mountain slope. The location of such forest tracts at the very edge of
their ranges gives them particular value in baseline studies of climate change
and anthropogenic effects.
<p> Lying to the southeast of the head of Laurel Fork and
the Spruce forest, the saddle area is at an elevation of near 3950 feet (1205
m) asl. The generally mesic forest here is marked by a magnificent Shagbark
Hickory remnant in an open field. A woods road (leading to a log landing) and
its continuation, the &quot; Mountain Path &quot; Trail extend southeast along
a low mountain spur. Here we saw a Red Eft of the Eastern Newt (<i>Notophthalmus viridescens</i>) in the road. A large clearcut (perhaps the
same observed at the Retreat Center) occurs on the southwest slope occupied by
the mesic forest. Along the Mountain Path there is a gradual transition from
the mesic forest to a xeric, ericaceous Oak- Chestnut type. In the transition
zone we observed the first White Oak seen by us in the entire area.
Accompanying canopy species were Northern Red Oak, Black Oak, Pignut Hickory of
undetermined species, Red and Sugar Maples and progressively more Chestnut Oak
as we advanced along the trail. Also present were scattered Hemlock and a few
Red Spruce saplings. American Chestnut sprouts were common. Striped Maple and
Hophornbeam were the most frequent understory species, but Downy Serviceberry
and Fire Cherry were also present. Shrubs included Witch Hazel, abundant Deer
Berry and, as we progressed, increasing Mountain Laurel and Black Huckleberry (
<i>Gaylussacia baccata</i>).  Here also, in late May, Rose Azalea was in bloom.
<p> Herbs seen in the more mesic part of the forest were
Plume Lily, Common Many Knees or Solomon's Seal (Po<i>lygonatum biflorum</i>) and Curtis Goldenrod. These
were followed by increasing frequencies of Trailing Arbutus, Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>), Gay Wings (<i>Polygalla paucifolia</i>), Moccasin Flower
(<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>) in bloom and
abundant cushions of<i>Leucobryum</i> moss as we entered the Oak-Chestnut forest (Braun, 1950).  Many
trees in this forest had their bases heavily covered by bryophytes and lichens.
Some taxa identified in the field on the base of a large Hemlock were the
mosses <i>Rhodobryum roseum</i>, species of <i>Leucobryum</i> and <i>Neckera</i>, the leafy
liverwort <i>Porella</i> and <i>Cladina</i> lichen. A microscopic study by R. Hunsucker
of bryophytes on the base of a Chestnut Oak revealed the mosses<i>Dicranum viride</i>, <i>Haplohymanium triste</i>, <i>Thelia
asprella</i>, <i>Campylium chrysophyllum</i>,
<i>Platygyrium epens</i>,<i>Brotherella
recurvans</i>, <i>Anomodon rostratus </i>and <i>Tortella
humilis</i>, in association with the liverwort<i>Frullania asagrayana</i>.
<p> Few birds were seen or heard in this forest. However
Wood Thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustelina</i>) 
and Ovenbird (<i>Seiurus aurocapillus</i>) 
calls were heard in the early May traverse. But these calls appeared to
originate from the more mesic part of the forest at a lower elevation.
<p> It should also be mentioned that somewhere here the
Trail enters the George Washington National Forest.
<p> At an elevation of perhaps 3700 feet (1129 m) asl
the Mountain Path traverses the top of a steep northeast-facing slope. Here the
forest again undergoes a transformation to a more mesic type. Although
dominated by Northern Red Oak, Sugar Maple, Shagbark Hickory and Striped Maple
were common and no ericaceae were seen. Herbs were sparse but some <i>Carex 
laxiflora </i>and Black Cohosh were seen. In one place a little Marginal
Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>) was associated with a rare
outcrop of sandstone and not far beyond numerous tiny Rove Beetles were seen on
a fungus.
<p> As the trail again followed the spur summit we
entered a grove of large Hemlock saplings under which grew Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i>) and abundant
Rattlesnake Weed (<i>Hieracium venosum</i>).  Continuing our descent along
the spur, we again entered an area of ericaceous oak forest. Here we came upon
a few plants of the rather uncommon grass <i>Calamagrostis porteri 
</i>as well as Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>). 
Finally we reached a clump of a few somewhat decadent Pitch and Table Mountain
Pines, accompanied in late May by Mountain Laurel in the last stages of
flowering. Also found here was a small Garter Snake (<i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>) that
exhibited its characteristic unpleasant odor on disturbance. Here we terminated
our traverse at near 3500 feet (1068 m) asl.

<h2>Return to Bear Mountain</h2>

<b>Source Walks: 6 - 7 - 02, 6 - 8 - 02 and 6 - 9 - 02</b>
<ul>
<p>Activities
on 6 - 7 - 02 began with a soil temperature determination (T - 432) at
approximately 11:30 A M. The site of this determination was at near 4369 feet (
1330 m) asl, on a flat aspect in young maple forest The location was along the road, just above the Endless Mountain
retreat Center. The value obtained at the usual depth of 5 inches (13 cm) was
T= 13.0 deg C. The air temperature was 15.0 deg C.
<p> Although our main activity at the Center was to be a
workshop on macrolichens, several inventories of other flora and fauna in the
surrounding forest were undertaken as well. In two of these inventories,
conducted on the afternoon of 6 - 7 - 02 and during the morning of 6 - 9 - 02,
we returned to an area first inventoried during our May, 1998 visits, namely
the slope immediately above the Retreat Center.
<p> Our walk of 6 - 7 - 02 began by observing and hearing
a Chestnut - sided Warbler, a species also noted in 1998. On this day it was
observed at the forest edge on the lower slope. Also noted here was a dense
growth of blackberries, now identified as the &quot;Thornless&quot; species <i>Rubus canadensis,</i> but possibly misidentified
in 1998. Just within the forest edge there was a fine, healthy appearing
American Chestnut sapling. Here also, Don Flenniken, our workshop leader, began
a lichen collection by observing <i>Parmelia 
sulcata </i>on the bark of a Red Maple.
<p> Immediately apparent, as on our 1998 visits, was the
dominance of sedges in the rather dense ground flora. Most common among these appeared to be<i>
Carex pensylvanica.</i> As on our
previous visits, the most common forbs
appeared to be Wood Anemone and an
unidentified <i>Prenanthes</i>. Also conspicuous on our present visit was
Indian Cucumberroot. Somewhat unusual was the variety of Indian Turnip, <i>Arisaema triphyllum 
</i>var <i>atrorubens</i>, with
its distinctive lateral leaflets, a feature that had gone unnoticed in 1998 as
a consequence of the early season. Other familiar features were the abundance
of Northern Red Oak and Red Maple in the canopy, the scattered small saplings
of Red Spruce, Canada Mayflower with a few plants still in bloom, the few large
American Basswood, Striped Maple, Whorled Loosestrife, the minor May Apple,
Cinnamon Fern, Sugar Maple with common seedlings of the same, Shagbark Hickory,
Yellow Birch, Dotted Thorn (<i>Crataegus 
punctata</i>), frost - injured Hay - scented Fern, Bluets (likely <i>Houstonia caerulea </i>rather than the <i>H.
serpyllifola</i>, perhaps erroneously reported in 1998 ), Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>), Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium filix - femina</i>) and the lichen <i>Cladonia furcata</i>.
<p> Next observed were a Red Admiral (<i>Vanessa atalanta</i>) Butterfly, Witch Hazel<i>,
Potentilla</i> simplex in bloom, an
unidentified species of <i>Mycena</i> fungus, Four - leaved Yam, abundant alien
Field Sorrel (<i>Rumex acetosella</i>) 
in seed, a Wood Pewee ( <i>Contopus 
virens</i>) and a Mourning Cloak (N<i>ymphalis antropa</i>) Butterfly; then, in a cluster
and in rapid motion, the butterflies Red - spotted Purple (<i>Limenitis arthemis 
astyanax</i>) and Gray Comma (<i>Polygonia progne</i>). These were followed by a Common Yellow - throat
Warbler (<i>Geothlypis trichas</i>), 
the alien buttercups <i>Ranunculus 
bulbosa </i>and <i>R. acris,</i>
the wood rush <i>Luzula multiflora </i>and
the sedge <i>Carex debilis.</i>
<p> On resuming our inventory on this slope on 6 - 9 -
02, we again identified Plume Lily, Lady Fern and Painted Trillium; then a
Browm Thrasher (<i>Toxostoma rufum</i>), Round - leaf Violet (<i>Viola </i>rotundifolia), seedlings of Thornless Blackberry, abundant <i>Carex pensylvanica</i>, <i>C. appalachica,</i>
Mountain Oatgrass, <i>Carex laxiflora,
C. aestrualis, </i>a large Round -
leaved Orchid (<i>Habenaria orbiculata</i>) and, in seepy areas, Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>) and the rush <i>Juncus effusus.</i>
<p><i> </i>As on our 5
- 30 - 98 visit, we encountered the
zebra - striped grasshoppers, although not in as great a number
<p> At
that time also we noted unidentified <i>Carex</i> in the Section Ovales. On
this day we identified this or these species as <i>Carex</i> <i>festucacea</i> and/or <i>C. brevior</i>, since the two appear to be very
similar and have been regarded as the same by some authors (Gleason, 1952). 
Also seen in the vicinity was a tiny Red Eft of the Eastern Newt (<i>Notophthalmus viridescens</i>). 
<p>A
soil sample (no 2) was also taken here. An initial pH value of 4.9 was
obtained. After 24 hours the value for this sample had decreased to 4.7, an
insignificant change considering measurement uncertainties.
<p> It was also noted that the new
growth of the Red Spruce saplings on this slope was considerably more (2 0
inches/5 cm vs. O.5 inch/1.3 cm) than that shown by saplings in the Spruce
forest along Laurel Run, as measured on the previous day.
<p>On 6-8-02 a foray was made to the Spruce forest at the head of Laurel run. A
soil temperature determination (T - 433) was made in needle duff under a
mature Red Spruce. Found for this soil
was T=12.5 deg C. The air temperature was 15.0 deg C at the time. The
temperature of the nearby Stream (T- 434) was also taken and found to be
T=13.0 deg C.
<p>A
soil sample (no 1) was taken at the same location from the usual depth of 2 -
3 inches (5 - 8 cm).  The initial pH of this soil was 3.7, but after 24 hours
this value had increased to 4.3.
<p>As
on our 1998 inventory, we noted the abundance of small Red Spruce saplings,
some of which, on this visit, bore spittle bugs (Cercopidae).  Although
uncommon, we encountered in several places small patches of 3 inch high Red
Spruce saplings, but very few current year seedlings.
<p>Also
apparent on this visit was the thin character of the leaf/needle mat, a feature
consistent with the presence of Red Maple and the birches, and only minor
Northern Red Oak.
<p>As
on our 1998 visit, Catawba Rhododendron was in bloom, here in deep shade. Also
seen were Bracken Fern (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>), abundant Stiff Club Moss, seedlings of Mountain Holly,
Cucumbertree and a 10 inch (0.25 m) 
dbh Mountain Ash (<i>Sorbus</i> <i>americana</i>) that was leaning and partially broken, but still reached the canopy. This was
the largest Mountain Ash ever seen by this reporter. 
<p>The
macrolichens that were collected from the forest on the slopes above and below
the Retreat Center were identified by Don Flenniken (1999). The forest type in
each case was Northern Hardwood 
dominated by Northern Red Oak, Red and Sugar Maples, with minor species
such as Yellow and Black Birches, Beech, American Basswood, Black Locust,
Shagbark Hickory, Hemlock and Red Spruce. The list presented here also
incorporates species recorded by Edward C. Uebel from these collections.
