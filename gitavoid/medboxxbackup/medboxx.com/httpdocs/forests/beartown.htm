Wilderness/Chestnut Ridge</h1></font>

<blockquote>



 <h2>General Features</h2>
<ul>
<P>	The region is
characterized by long, straight and winding sandstone ridges that
close back on themselves to form features such as Burke's Garden, a
3100 foot  (945 m)  high agricultural valley composed largely of
Ordovician limestones. The major linear ridge, continuous Chestnut
Ridge and Garden Mountain, consists of Undivided Silurian Formations
according to Rader and Evans  (1993).  Where observed by us on the
summit of Garden Mountain, sandstone was exposed, and it is likely
that this rock dominates generally along the Ridge. Elevations range
up to 4700 feet  (1335 m)  asl on adjacent Beartown Mountain.</P>
<P>	Regional precipitation
falls in the range of 1050 mm  (40 inches)  according to Hayden (1979),  but local values in the vicinity of the higher elevations may
be considerably more. The rather broad summit area of the Beartown
Wilderness on Beartown Mountain, which has the highest elevations, is
occupied by Red Spruce   (<I>Picea  rubens</I>)  forest and northern
hardwoods, and the latter also dominate some deep valleys such as
that of Roaring Fork, which are subject to cold air drainage from the
adjacent highlands. Great Rhododendron  (<I>Rhododendron  maximum</I>) is important at all elevations in these forests, indicating a
general abundance of moisture. However, high, narrow-topped ridges
surrounding the Wilderness area, such as Chestnut Ridge, have milder,
dryer climates, although they range above 4000 feet  (1200 m)  asl.
It is likely that cold air originating on these ridges, as a
consequence of radiation cooling, is readily shed to the valleys
below, as there is nothing to trap it at the higher elevations.</P>

</H2>



 <ul>
<b>The Approach, 7-19-94</b>

<ul>
<P>	Our objective was to
characterize the vegetation in the vicinity of the
Federally-designated Beartown Wilderness, although access to the
latter was greatly limited in the time available due to the severity
of the terrain. Our approach to the general area was from the
northwest on Forest Road 222, first descending into the deep valley
of Laurel Creek. Here we noted rich mesic forests, with common Canada
Hemlock  (<I>Tsuga  canadensis</I>),  with little evidence of the
Woolly Adelgid  (<I>Adelges   tsugae</I>),  as well as abundant Great
Rhododendron. Other species noted were Tuliptree  (<I>Liriodendron 
tulipifera</I>),  Black Birch  (<I>Betula  lenta</I>)  and Yellow
Buckeye  (<I>Aesculus  octandra</I>).  Also seen was a fine large
accipiter, likely a Cooper's Hawk  (<I>Accipiter  cooperi</I>), 
darting through among the trees.</P>
<P>We
soon came to the junction with forest Road 631, and turning left on
it, began our ascent of the mountain to near the Beartown Wilderness
boundary. At near the local summit we encountered a &quot;kelley
hump&quot; in the road, which stopped further progress, and here we
established our camp at an elevation of a little over 3000 feet  (
315 m).  Our night was spent listening to Whippoorwills  (<I>Caprimulus
 vociferus</I>)  and Barred Owls  (<I>Strix  varia</I>) </P>
<P>The
forest here was rather xeric, developed on yellowish-red, silty- clay
soils. Dominant trees were Black, Scarlet, Chestnut, Northern Red and
White Oaks  (<I>Quercus  velutina, Q.  coccinea, Q.  prinus, Q, 
rubra</I> and <I>Q.  alba</I>).  Other canopy species were Red Maple
 (<I>Acer  rubrum</I>),  Pignut Hickory  (<I>Carya  glabra</I> and/or <I>C.  ovalis</I>),  Black Gum  (<I>Nyssa  sylvatica</I>),  Black
Cherry  (<I>Prunus  serotina</I>),   Black Locust  (<I>Robinia 
pseudoacacia</I>)  and a few large Tuliptrees. Small trees and large
shrubs noted were Sourwood   (<I>Oxydendrum  arboreum</I>), 
Flowering Dogwood  (<I>Cornus  florida</I>),  American Chestnut (<I>Castanea  dentata</I>)  sprouts, Mountain Laurel  (<I>Kalmia 
latifolia</I>)  and a little Great Rhododendron. Also common were
Deerberry  (<I>Vaccinium  stamineum</I>)  and other blueberries,
including likely Upland Low Blueberry  (<I>Vaccinium  pallidum</I>). </P>
<P>Among
herbs, Wood Tickseed  (<I>Coreopsis  major</I>),  blooming Indian
Tobacco  (<I>Lobelia </I> <I>inflata</I>)  and trailing Arbutus (<I>Epigaea  repens</I>)  were common along the road. Also noted were
Mountain Mint  (<I>Pycnanthemum  montanum</I>), and another similar,
but unidentified mint, possibly Hoary Mountain Mint (<I> P. incanum
</I>). Birds heard and/or seen during the day included American
Robins  (<I>Turdus  migratorius</I>)  and vireos, likely Red-eyed (<I>Vireo  olivaceus</I>).  Whippoorwills and Barred Owls were also
heard again in the early morning.</P>
</ul>
<p>
<b>7-20-94 Ascent of  Chestnut Ridge.</b>
<ul>
 We
planned to ascend the southwest end of Chestnut Ridge to the
Appalachian Trail and follow this along the Ridge to the shelter
overlooking Burke's Garden. The first leg lay along the road to the
Wilderness edge. The forest here consisted of the previously
mentioned five oaks, pignut hickory,  Red Maple, Black Cherry, Black
Locust, Black Gum, with scattered Tuliptree and Cucumber Magnolia (<I>Magnolia  acuminata</I>).  There was also some Pitch Pine  (<I>Pinus
 rigida</I>).  Sourwood, Flowering Dogwood, Serviceberry  (likely
<I>Amelanchier  arborea</I>)  and American Chestnut sprouts formed an
understory, and Mountain Laurel, Deerberry and other blueberries 
shrub layers. Herbs were Hay-scented fern  (<I>Dennstaedtia 
punctilobula</I>),  Bracken Fern  (<I>Pteridium  aquilinum </I>),
Whorled Loosestrife  (<I>Lysimachia  quadrifolia</I>),  Wood Tickseed, Trailing Arbutus, Teaberry  (<I>Gaultheria  procumbens</I>),  Wild
indigo  (<I>Baptisia  tinctoria</I>)  and White Wood aster  (<I>Aster
 divaricatus</I>). We also flushed two Wild Turkeys  (<I>Meleagris 
gallopavo</I>),  one a chick. 
</P>
<P>On the next leg we
ascended from about 3100 feet to about 3690 feet  (1125 m)  asl., at
the junction with the Appalachian Trail. Black, Scarlet and White
Oaks remained common on this slope, but Chestnut Oak had begun to
fade, and Northern Red Oak became more common, as did pignut hickory.
There was also some Tuliptree and Cucumber Magnolia, as well as one
apparently healthy Hemlock. We now encountered our first Striped
Maple  (<I>Acer</I>  <I>pensylvanicum </I>), although it is likely
that this species occurs at lower elevations as well. Also seen at
about mid-slope was an unidentified high-bush blueberry  (<I>Vaccinium
</I> sp)  with dark berries, an unidentified serviceberry and
Deerberry. Common in the ground cover were Galax  (<I>Galax  aphylla</I>), Pink Ladyslipper  (<I>Cypripedium  acaule</I>),  Rattlesnake
Plantain (<I> Goodyera  pubescens</I>),  Spotted Wintergreen (<I>Chimaphila  maculata</I>),  Christmas Fern  (<I>Polystichum</I> 
<I>acrostichoides </I>) and White Wood Aster. Red Maple and Sassafras
continued common, and a few small Sugar Maples (<I> Acer  saccharum </I>)
were seen. As in virtually ever Appalachian forest of this type,
Four-leaved Yam  (<I>Dioscorea  quaternata</I>)  appeared almost
omnipresent.</P>
<P>Near the top of the
leg, where the slope became less, conditions became more mesic, as is
often the case, and White Ash  (<I>Fraxinus  americana</I>),  May
Apple (<I>Podophyllum  peltatum</I>)  and Black Cohosh  (<I>Cimicifuga
 racemosa</I>) appeared. Basilbalm  (<I>Monarda  clinopodia</I>) 
with white blooms, and Dotted St. Johns-wort  (<I>Hypericum 
punctatum</I>) also became common. Northern Red Oak increased again
in frequency, and a grove consisting almost entirely of pignut
hickory was encountered. Just southwest of the junction with the
Appalachian Trail old fields begin, and there was much hawthorn (<I>Crataegus </I> sp)  with dark green, glossy leaves. Black Cherry (frequently wind-broken), Black Locust, Sassafras and still scattered
Tuliptrees. These fields, in addition to scattered trees, contained
Timothy Grass  (<I>Phleum </I> <I>pratense</I>),  large patches of
what appeared to be a blackberry  (<I>Rubus </I>sp),  an unidentified
 hazelnut  (<I>Corylus</I>  sp)  and Bracken Fern. Unexpectedly,
healthy looking, if rather stunted, Tuliptree occurred at 3700 feet
here. However, Chestnut  Oak, more characteristically, dropped out
below this elevation.</P>
<P>As we continued
climbing through the old fields, Northern Red Oak and White Ash
became proportionately more common,  but Tuliptree appeared to have
dropped out. Red Maple remained relatively common.</P>
<P>The next leg began
at about 4000 feet asl, where the Trail entered a forest of Northern
Red and White Oaks, White Ash, Red Maple, Black Cherry and, for the
first time, Yellow Birch  (<I>Betula  alleghaniensis</I>).  An
understory consisted of<I> </I>Mountain Maple<I>  (Acer  spictum), 
</I>an unidentified<I> </I>serviceberry  (<I>Amelanchier </I> sp) <I>,
</I>Wild Raisin<I>  (Viburnum  cassinoides</I>),  unidentified
high-bush blueberry  (<I>Vaccinium </I> sp)  and hawthorn  (<I>Crataegus</I>
 sp),  Great Rhododendron and, for the first time, Catawba
Rhododendron  (<I>Rhododendron  catawbiense</I>).  The Great
Rhododendron was in bloom, but the Catawba Rhododendron was already
forming seeds. In one place there was a small grove of American beech
(<I>Fagus  grandifolia</I>),  with minor Sugar Maple. Also common
were several species of  unidentified berries (<I>Rubus  </I>sp), 
Cinnamon Fern  (<I>Osmunda  cinnamomea</I>)  and Witch Hazel (<I>Hamamelis </I> <I>virginiana</I>).  Noted at 4200 feet   (1280 m) 
were Black Birch and curiously, one Tuliptree, in the highest station
for this species observed by this reporter in the Central
Appalachians. Here also was one small American Mountain Ash  (<I>Sorbus
 americana</I>),  with seedlings of the same. Also present in the
area were unidentified azaleas  (deciduous rhododendrons),  American
Chestnut sprouts, Cucumber Magnolia, Mountain Holly,  (<I>Ilex 
montana</I>),  pignut hickory, Witch Hazel,  Maleberry  (<I>Lyonia 
ligustrina</I>),  Southern Mountain Cranberry  (<I>Vaccinium 
erythrocarpum</I>),  Lady Fern  (<I>Athyrium  filix-femina</I>), 
Teaberry, Christmas Fern, Pale Jewelweed  (<I>Impatiens  pallida</I>), possible American Lovage  (<I>Ligusticum  canadense</I> ),  Plume
Lily  (<I>Smilacina  racemosa</I>),  Fire pink  (<I>Silene  virginica</I>),  Wild Geranium  (<I>Geranium  maculatum</I>),  Common Speedwell (<I>Veronica  officinalis</I>),  Dotted St. Johns-wort, Canada
Mayflower  (<I>Maianthemum  canadense</I>),  Wild Sarsaparilla (<I>Aralia  nudicaulis</I>),  Indian Cucumber-root  (<I>Medeola 
virginiana</I>)  Galax, Mountain Aster  (<I>Aster  acuminatus</I>), 
Basilbalm, Four-leaved Yam and Wild lily-of-the-Valley  (<I>Convallaria
 montana</I>).  An unidentified luxuriant haircap moss  (<I>Polytrichum
</I> sp)  formed an intergrowth with a number of the foregoing
plants. In one place Mountain Aster, Canada Mayflower, Galax and an
unidentified plant, possibly an orchid, formed an association under
Beech. This plant had oval, glaberous  leaves, dark green on top,
grayish-green on the bottom, with some flat against the ground.. A
Catbird  (<I>Dumetella  carolinensis  </I>) also called here.</P>
<P>	It should be mentioned that many of
the large oaks in this high elevation forest were found to be dead or
dying, although no obvious causes, such as defoliation by insects
such as the Gypsy Moth  (<I>Lymantria  dispar</I>)  were evident.</P>
<P>	From a number of viewpoints along
Chestnut Ridge the dark spires of the Beartown Wilderness spruce
forest are clearly distinguishable. Also, at the point of the
Appalachian Trail shelter, virtually the entire Burkes Garden Valley
was in view.</P>
 </ul>
 <p>
<b>Roaring Fork</b>
 <ul>
<P>	On 7-21-94 a traverse was made into
the Beartown Wilderness, along the abandoned Forest Road 631, to
Roaring Fork, which lay about a mile to the north. The traverse was
essentially along the 3100 foot contour. The first part of the
traverse was through xeric oak forest, as already described, and
perhaps 50 years in age. Birds noted were Wild Turkeys,  Scarlet
Tanagers  (<I>Piranga  olivacea</I>)  and unidentified vireos.
Teaberry appeared unusually abundant and soon Shining Clubmoss (<I>Lycopodium  lucidulum</I>)  began to appear on the road bank with
Galax. A large Chicken -of-the-Woods mushroom  (<I>Laetiporous 
sulphureous</I>)  had also been collected from this forest on the
previous day.</P>
<P>	This forest gradually became more
mesic, Hay-scented Fern  (<I>Dennstaedtia  punctilobula</I>) 
appeared, with seedlings of Fraser Magnolia  (<I>Magnolia  fraseri</I>) and Northern Red Oak. The frequency of Tuliptree, many
double-trunked, increased, as did Hemlock, and Striped Maple began to
appear. However pignut was still common,  as was Red Maple. Then
Round-leaf Violet  (<I>Viola  rotundifolia</I>)  with Christmas Fern
became common on the shaded road bank. Large Northern Red Oak also
became more common, Wild Sarsaparilla and a patch of Wild
Lily-of-the-Valley were noted, and the first Mealy Bellwort (<I>Uvularia  perfoliata</I>)  was seen. The soil here appeared to be
a red-brown silty loam, with a six-inch  (15 cm)  organic  (mor) 
layer on top.</P>
<P>
As we approached Roaring Fork, which here flowed over nearly
flat-lying rock beds, Great Rhododendron and Hemlock became more
abundant. The Hemlock here appeared unhealthy, but there was no clear
sign of the Woolly Adelgid. Black and Yellow Birches, Northern Red
Oak, Black Gum, Large Tuliptrees and Cucumber and Fraser Magnolias
became more abundant. There were also some basswoods  (likely
American, or <I>Tilia  americana</I>).  Near the stream Yellow Birch
assumed dominance. Shrubs, in addition to Great Rhododendron,
included Mountain Holly, Hobblebush  (<I>Viburnum  alnifolium</I>) 
and Witch Hazel. Ground cover included Clearweed  (<I>Pilea  pumila</I>), an unidentified alum root  (<I>Heuchera </I> sp ),  Horse Balm (
<I>Collinsonia  canadensis</I>),  a trillium  (likely <I>Trillium 
erectum</I>),  Indian Cucumber-root, an unidentified agrimony (<I>Agrimonia </I> sp),  White Wood Aster, Mountain Aster, violets,
including Round-leaf Violet, an unidentified Meadowrue  (<I>Thalictrum</I>
 sp)  and a golden alexanders  (likely <I>Zizia  aptera</I>).  An
unidentified<I> chantrelle </I>(<I> Cantharellus  </I>sp<I>) 
</I>mushroom was also noted, and a Wood Thrush<I> </I> (<I>Hylocichla
 mustelina</I>)  was heard singing. However, no fish were observed,
although the stream is said to contain native Brook Trout (<I>Salvelinus  fontinalis</I>). </P>
<P>The mesic
environment, the northerly aspect and the low gradient of the valley
at this point, all favor the occurrence of northern species such as
Yellow Birch, Hobblebush and Mountain Aster at an elevation of little
more than 3000 feet asl, compared to their apparent restriction to
elevations considerably above 4000 feet on Chestnut Ridge.</P>
