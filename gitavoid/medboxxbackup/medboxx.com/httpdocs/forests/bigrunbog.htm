<h2>Abstract</h2>
 <ul>
<p> A botanical survey of Big Run
Bog Candidate Research Natural Area, located in Tucker County, West Virginia,
Cheat Ranger District, Monongahela National Forest, during the growing season
1993 – 94, produced 194 species in 118 genera and 52 families of vascular
plants. Six species of rare vascular plants, previously known for this area,
were found in this study. Vascular plant families with the largest numbers of
species were Cyperaceae (24), Asteraceae (23), Poaceae (16) and Ericaceae (14).
Exotic species (4) accounted for 0.02 % of the total vascular flora of 194
species. For each taxon are given family, scientific and common name (s),
habitat, estimated abundance and whether native or not. Mosses and liverworts
numbered 89 species in 56 genera and 33 families. For each taxon are given
family, species and habitat.

<p><h2>Physical Description</h2>
<ul>
<p>The Big Run
Bog Candidate Research Natural Area is located in the Cheat Ranger District,
Monongahela National Forest. The geographic center is approximately 39 deg 07 '
N latitude and 79 deg 35 ' W longitude. Topographically the area consists of
ridges and slopes of moderate steepness (2 deg – 25 deg), part of Backbone
Mountain, surrounding a shallow basin which forms the headwaters of Big Run, a
tributary of the Blackwater River. Elevations range from 970 meters (3190 ft.) to 1100 meters (3620 ft.).  Total area for the CRNA is 256 hectares (632
acres) (Establishment Record for Big Run Bog CRNA, 1987). 
<p> The research area is in the Appalachian Plateau
physiographic province (Fenneman, 1938). The region is underlain by alternating sequences of shale, siltstone,
sandstone and coal of the Pottsville Group and Allegheny Formation (West
Virginia Geological Survey, Tucker County, 1923). 
<p> Soils on 0–5% slopes are Lickdale very stony silt
loam, on 3–15% slopes Ernest extremely stony silt loam (USDA – Soil Survey
of Tucker County, 1967). 
<p> In the bog itself, peat occurs to a maximum depth of
225 cm. The surface of the bog slopes inward gently (1 deg – 2 deg) in all
directions. Water and nutrients drain into the bog from the surrounding
watershed, making it a minerotrophic fen rather than a true ombotrophic bog.
The surface waters have an average pH of 4.02 (Wieder, 1982, 1985). 
<p> The climate is of the continental type: in winter
there are frequent and often severe snow and ice storms, in warmer seasons
frequent showers and thunderstorms. Cold air drains from the surrounding ridges
and slopes into the bowl – like basin. Frost may occur any time of the year (
Horn and McGuire, 1960; Wieder, McCormick and Lang, 1981).  Climatic conditions
for the research area (Wieder and Lang, 1983; NOAA – National Climatic Data
Center, 1985) are estimated from data collected over a 34 – year period at a
national weather station located 15 km away at Canaan Valley (elevation 991
meters).  The mean annual temperature is 7.9 deg C. July is the warmest month
with a mean of 18.3 deg C. December, January and February are the coldest
months with mean monthly temperatures below freezing 0 deg C, 32 deg F. Mean
annual precipitation is 133 cm. June is the wettest month, with an average
maximum of 12.7 cm, November the driest, with an average minimum of 9.0 cm. There are about 97 frost – free
days, from 2 June through 7 September (Horn and McGuire, 1960; Wieder,
McCormick and Lang, 1981; Wieder and Lang, 1983; NOAA – National Climatic Data
Center, 1985).

<h2>Methods</h2>
<ul>
<p>A reconnaissance of
Big Run Bog CRNA was done in September 1993. From late March through early
October, 1994 the area was visited every 2 – 3 weeks for at least 2 days to
observe and gather data on plants and their habitats. 
<p>Six line transects spaced 190.5 m apart on a randomly
chosen bearing of 96 deg and extending across the landscape from east –
southeast to west – northwest were systematically sampled in the forest at
intervals of 60.4 m, in 400 square meter plots. In each sample plot were noted
species present, estimated abundance of each and plant association. Aspect,
slope and landform were also noted. 130 plots were sampled.
<p>The bog and transition zone between bog and forests
were sampled using the Nature Conservancy releve (plot) method (Sneddon,
1993).  This method is more detailed and quantitative than the one used for
forests. A single line transect on a randomly chosen bearing of 304 deg
extended nearly the length of the bog from SE to NW. Eight sample plots of 64
square meters were sampled at subjectively chosen locations along the transect.
In these plots various data were recorded, including the species present,
estimated cover of each, and average height of plant strata. The transition
zone – between bog and forests-was sampled with a 400 square meter plot about midway on the eastern and western sides
of the bog.
<p>Species abundance was estimated using a scale of
abundance; rare … etc. (see handbook for RNA studies). 
<p>The scientific names of vascular plants are mostly
after Gleason and Cronquist (1991) ; the few exceptions follow Fernald (1950). Common names tend to follow Strausbaugh and Core (1977).  The names of
mosses follow Crum and Anderson (1981); liverworts follow Schuster (1966). 
<p>Specimens for the herbarium were collected in
duplicate and air – dried for voucher specimens.

<h2>Plants of Special Interest</h2>
 <ul>
 <p>
  Six species of vascular plants, rare in West
Virginia and of special interest, occur at Big run Bog (Rare Species List,
West Virginia Natural Heritage Program, June, 1994).  
<p><i>Calopogon tuberosus</i> (L.) BSP. (<i>C. pulchellus</i>). Grass – pink. A wide-ranging species of orchid, extending from Canada south
to Florida and Texas, in acid bogs and swamps. In West Virginia, reported from
Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral, Pocahontas, Tucker and Webster Counties. A few dozen
plants grow in the bog on the east side.
<p><i>Carex canescens</i> L. Hoary Sedge. This is a northern plant, extending from boreal
regions south to Virginia, Ohio, Minnesota, Arizona and California. West
Virginia plants occur in acid sphagnum bogs at high elevations in the mountain
counties of Pocahontas and Tucker.
<p><i>Listera smallii</i> Wieg. Appalachian Twayblade. This species of orchid occurs in the
Appalachian Mountains from southern Pennsylvania and West Virginia, to eastern
Kentucky, south to Georgia, South Carolina and east Tennessee. In West Virginia
it is found in damp woods and thickets from about 2000 – 3000 ft. elevation and
is reported from Pocahontas, Mercer, Randolph and Tucker Counties. At Big Run
Bog six plants were found growing on the east side of the bog under Great
Laurel.
<p><i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i> L. Buckbean. A northern species of plant ranging from
boreal regions south to New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana,
Missouri and California. West Virginia populations are known only from a few
sites in Pocahontas and Tucker Counties. At Big Run Bog some 50 plants occur in
a very small area about midway on the east side of the bog. 
<p><i>Parnassia asarifolia</i> Vent. Grass – of – Parnassus. This is a species chiefly of the
mountains, ranging from Virginia and West Virginia to Georgia and west to
Arkansas and east Texas, growing in bogs, springy places and along small
streams. West Virginia plants grow in the mountain counties of Greenbrier,
Pocahontas, Randolph, Tucker, Upshur and Webster, at elevations mostly above
2000 feet. Less than a dozen plants grow in a small area on the east side of
the bog.
<p><i>Pogonia ophioglossoides</i> (L.) Ker 
Gawler. Rose Pogonia. This wide – ranging orchid grows in bogs and wet
meadows, Newfoundland to Minnesota, south to Florida and Texas In West Virginia
it is found in sphagnum bogs in the mountain counties of Fayette, Hampshire,
Monongalia, Pocahontas, Preston, Randolph, Tucker and Upshur. More than 50
plants were noted on the east side of the bog.

<h2>Literature Review</h2>
<ul>
  Wieder, <i>et al</i> (1981) and Walbridge (1982) reported nine species of mosses and
58 species of vascular plants for Big Run Bog. Species of <i>Sphagnum</i> and <i>Polytrichum</i>
covered 85% of the bog surface. Trees and upland shrubs were generally limited
to wetland borders. In four communities characterized by them, <i>Sphagnum</i>
and <i>Poltrichum</i> covered 88 – 100 % of the bog surface, but in two
communities <i>Polytrichum</i> was dominant. Communities varied with respect to
shrubs, the per cent of cover varying
from very low to over 11 %. (Wieder <i>et al</i>, 1981) did a vegitational
analysis of the bog. They considered 36 species of vascular plants and mosses.
They concluded that the bog was dominated by <i>Sphagnum</i> and<i>
Polytrichum,</i> which together covered 85 % of the surface. Vascular
herbaceous species covered about 1/2 of the surface of the bog. Leading
dominants were<i>Eriophorum 
virginicum,</i> other sedges, rushes and <i>Solidago uliginosa.</i> They distinguished four bog
communities: <i>Sphagnum – Eriophorum 
virginicum</i>, <i>Sphagnum</i> -shrub,<i>Polytrichum</i> – shrub and <i>Polytrichum</i> – <i>Carex canescens</i>. The authors considered the
vegetation of each community and the spatial pattern of distribution of
communities in the bog.</h3>
<p> Wieder (1985) reported peat deposits with a
thickness of 225 cm and a radiocarbon date to 13,000 +/- 420 years before the
present. (BP). Walbridge (1982) described several plant communities for Big
Run Bog. Chief among these were (1) Coniferous swamp forest, dominated by Red
Spruce or Eastern Hemlock, with minor Red Maple and Yellow Birch; (2) <i>Hypericum densiflorum</i> community, dominated by the
shrubby St. Johnswort, with a herbaceous cover of sedges, grasses, mosses and
dewberry; (3) <i>Rubus hispidus</i> –
mixed shrub community, consisting of the dominant dewberry with various shrubs,
dwarfed trees and a herbaceous cover of sedges, grasses, rushes and mosses; (4)
three major types of communities dominated by mosses: <i>Sphagnum, Polytrichum</i> and
mixed <i>Polytrichum</i> hummock – <i>Sphagnum</i> hollow communities. Herbaceous
communities included (1) <i>Leersia 
oryzoides</i> communities and <i>Carex</i> <i>canescens</i> meadow community.
<p> Wieder and Lang (1983) reported annual net primary
production of <i>Sphagnum magellanicum,
S. recurvum</i> and<i>Polytrichum commune</i> as 5.4, 6.1 and 7.9 g dry mass
per square dm respectively.
<p> Wieder <i>et al</i> (1984) studied the flowering
phenology of 21 species in four plant communities. Of these, ten were wind –
pollinated monocots, ten were insect – pollinated dicots and one species of
dicot was primarily self – pollinated (<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>).  Flowering occurred from mid – May through
late September. The growing season was 136 days. The average length of
flowering of the 21 species was 30 days.
<p> Big Run Bog receives water and nutrients from the
surrounding slopes and ridges. Physiographically the bog is a minerotrophic
fen, but chemically it is like an embotrophic bog (Wieder, 1985). 
<p> Wieder <i>et al</i> (1989) concluded that both
cover and production in Big Run Bog is dominated by mosses. Mosses covered 67.6
% of the bog surface; herbaceous species covered 42 % of the bog surface.
Trailing shrubs – mostly<i>Rubus 
hispidus</i> – covered 43 % of the bog surface. Upright shrubs covered
21% of the surface.

<h2>Description of Individual Habitats Surveyed</h2>
<ul>
<p> The extant vegetation of the forests is second –
growth. The bog may have been logged some time ago, but there are no evident
signs of it now. Vegetation of the area is placed in three cover types: Bog,
Northern Hardwood Forest and Spruce Forest. A fourth type may be recognized, in
the Transition Zone, bounded by bog and forests (Braun, 1950 ; Core, 1966;
Eyre, 1980; Walbridge, 1982) 
 <p>
&nbsp;
</ul>
<h2>Bog</h2>
<ul>
 The
un-forested bog covers an estimated 18 ha (44 acres) and is approximately 1.2
km long and up to 180 meters wide. The bog is an irregular mosaic of several
plant communities growing on hummocks (small elevations above the level
surface) and in valleys between. There is a 
considerable amount of surface water (the extent not measured) in the
two beaver dam ponds, in small streams entering the bog and in the central main
channel; however, most of the surface is vegetated. There is no evidence of
recent beaver activity. The hummocks support mostly dwarfed trees, shrubs,
seedlings, low ericaceous plants, perennial ferns and a few species of non –
vasculars. Characteristic species of vascular plants are<i>Rhododendron maximum, Ilex verticillata, Picea 
rubens, Acer rubrum</i>, <i>Viburnum cassinoides, Nemopanthus mucronata, Kalmia latifolia, Aronia 
melanocarpa, Gaultheria 
hispidula, Vaccinium 
angustifolium, V. myrtilloides,
Osmunda cinnamomea;</i> dominant mosses
are species of <i>Polytrichum</i> and<i>Sphagnum;</i> lichens are chiefly
species of <i>Cladonia.</i>
<p>  In the
intervals or valleys between the hummocks the dominant plants are perennial
sedges, rushes, low – growing ericaceous shrubs, dewberry and mosses. The
characteristic species of vascular plants are<i>Carex canescens, C. folliculata, C. 
trisperma, C. interior,</i> <i>C. scoparia</i>, <i>Eriophorum virginicum</i>, <i>Rhynchospora alba</i>, S<i>cirpus atrocinctus</i>, <i>Dulichium 
arundinaceum</i>, <i>Vaccinium macrocarpon</i>,
<i>V. oxycoccos</i>, <i>Gaultheria hispidula</i>, <i>Rubus hispidus</i>, <i>Aronia 
melanocarpa</i>, <i>Juncus subcaudatus</i>,
<i>J. effusus</i>, <i>Solidago uliginosa</i>, <i>Gentiana linearis</i> and <i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>. Characteristic
species of mosses are <i>Sphagnum 
fallax</i>, <i>S. girgensohnii</i>, <i>S. imbricatum</i>, S<i>. magellanicum</i>, <i>S. 
recurvum</i>, <i>Polytrichum commune</i> and <i>P. ohioense</i>. Estimated per cent
cover of each species varied widely from one area of the bog to another; for
example, the vascular plants <i>Carex 
canescens</i>, 
2–60%,<i> C. 
folliculata,</i> 
2–80% , <i>Rhynchospora alba,</i> 
2–60%,<i>Rubus hispidus,</i> 
5–30% ,<i>Vaccinium macrocarpon</i>,
2–50%, <i>V. 
oxycoccos,</i> 
2–70%, <i>Eriophorum virginicum,</i> 
2–5%, <i>Aronia melanocarpa</i>, 
2–3% and the mosses<i>Sphagnum</i> spp., 
50–95%, <i>Polytrichum</i> spp.,
2–95%.
The per cent cover of shrubs (1.0 – 2.0 m) ranged from 
3–12%, the herbaceous layer (&gt; 1 m, excluding
mosses), 
30–95% and the moss layer from 
25–95%. The classification of
plant communities was not an objective of this survey. Classifications of
Walbridge (1982) and Wieder et al (1981) are presented in the literature
review.

<p><h2>Northern Hardwood Forest</h2>
<ul>
<p>The
Northern Hardwood Forest occupies the upland slopes and ridges and contains the
largest area (234 ha) of the Big Run Bog CRNA. This forest has been
characterized as a &quot;Black Cherry – Maple type, with small inclusions of
Sugar Maple – Beech – yellow Birch and Hemlock – Yellow Birch&quot; (Braun,
1950; Core, 1966; Eyre, 1980; Establishment Record for Big Run Bog, 1987).  At
Big run Bog the characteristic species of trees are (a) dominants<i>
Prunus serotina, Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia, Betula 
alleghaniensis, B. lenta,
Tsuga canadensis</i> and<i>
Magnolia fraseri</i>, and (b) associated species <i>Quercus rubra,
Acer saccharum, Magnolia acuminata</i> and <i>Amelanchier laevis</i>. The characteristic species of
shrubs are<i>Acer pensylvanicum,
Hamamelis virginiana, Ilex montana</i> and <i>Rhodoendron maximum</i>. The latter species often forms
nearly impenetrable thickets. The herbaceous layer of vegetation (&lt; 1 m,
both herbs and woody plants) has a rich diversity of lycopods, ferns and seed
plants. Characteristic species of vascular plants are <i>Carex intumescens, C. debilis, C. laxiflora,
C. pensylvanica, Lycopodium obscurum, L. digitatum, L. annotinum, L. clavatum, Oxalis montana,
Smilax rotundifolia, Thelypteris noveboracensis, Dryopteris intermedia, Trillium undulatum, Gaultheria procumbens, Medeola virginiana, Erythronium americanum, Claytonia caroliniana, Dennstaedtia punctilobula, Epifagus virginiana, Mitchella repens, Maianthemum canadense, Trientalis borealis, Agrostis perennans, Anemone 
quinquefolia, Brachyelytrum 
erectum, Viola rotundifolia</i> and <i>V. blanda.</i>
<p>&nbsp;<p>
</ul>
<p><h2>Spruce Forest</h2>
<ul>
<p>

The
Spruce Forest (Braun, 1950; Core, 1966; Eyre, 1980) occurs in patches on the
north and north – northwest borders of the bog. It occupies an area of about 4
ha (10 acres).  Picea rubens is
dominant or a co – dominant with <i>Acer 
rubrum, Betula lenta, B.</i> <i>alleghaniensis, Prunus serotina</i> and <i>Tsuga canadensis</i>. The shrub layer is dominated
by <i>Rhododendron maximum</i>, with
minor<i>Ilex</i> <i>montana</i>. The
herbaceous layer supports a rather sparse growth of <i>Oxalis montana, Mitchella repens, Lycopodium 
annotinum, Maianthemum 
canadense, Carex debilis</i> and
<i>Gaultheria hispidula</i>. Frequent
bryophytes are <i>Bazzania trilobata</i>
and species of <i>Sphagnum</i>.
<p>&nbsp;<p>
</ul>
<h2>Transition Zone</h2>
<ul>
<p>The
transition zone refers to the distinctive irregular narrow band occurring
between the bog and the forests around it. One aspect of it occurs mostly along
the north – northeast to the south side of the bog where a few species of
plants reach their best growth. The dominant trees are<i>Acer rubrum, Picea rubens, Prunus serotina</i> and
<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>. The dominant
shrubs of the shrub layer that characterize this zone:<i>Nemopanthus mucronata, Ilex verticillata</i> and <i>Viburnum 
cassinoides</i>. Other species of woody plants include <i>Hamamelis virginiana, Rhododendron maximum, Kalmia latifolia, Taxus 
canadensis, Vaccinium 
angustifolium, V. myrtilloides,
V.</i> <i>corymbosum, Rubus hispidus, Lycopodium obscurum, Osmunda cinnamomea, O. 
claytoniana</i> and<i>Carex 
folliculata.</i> Mosses here are chiefly species of <i>Sphagnum</i> and <i>Polytrichum</i>.
