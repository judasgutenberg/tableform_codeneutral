Taking its name from large springs that issue from the foot of Back Creek Mountain, the area of interest consists of several square miles of rugged forested terrain bisected by a strong mountain river.  This river, a branch of the James System, modestly known as Back Creek, was superimposed on the area before it was elevated, and in time, as elevation occurred, cut a steep-sided winding gorge through Lower Devonian sandstones, shales and limestones (Rader and Evans,1993).  Because these rocks were closely folded and faulted during the Appalachian orogeny and then deeply eroded, the distribution of different rock types is exceedingly complex.  One result is that the same rock units may be juxtaposed in different ways.  Superimposed on this deformation and past erosion are more recent episodes of rock falls, sliding and slumping of valley sides, the formation of talus and deep colluvial soils.  Elevations in the area range from about 1700 feet (520 meters) to almost 3000 feet (910 meters) asl with as much as 1000 feet (300 meters) of local relief along Back Creek.         </P><P>The interaction of Back Creek with various rock types is shown by the exaggerated bends of what were probably once meanders on a flood plain.  Where limestone occurs, the gorge walls on the outside bends are steepened, while the inner slip-off slopes extend gently toward the stream.  This indicates more lateral than vertical erosion at the bends, due, most likely, to dissolution of limestone there.  A result of this configuration of the gorge is a discontinuous flood plain and stream deposits ranging from coarse cobble and boulder bars and flats to patches of finer river alluvium.  The channel itself consists of stretches of rocky rapids, picturesque falls and deep holes.  Characteristically clear, its waters yet harbor a diverse aquatic life ranging from swarms of coiled gastropods to large trout and Beaver along its banks.  At times Bald Eagles may be seen flying low above the water.  And those who sit quietly on the shore may be startled by Black Bear coming to the waters edge even in daylight.         </P><P>The river bluffs are highly varied with steep limestone cliffs (nesting places for Ravens) deep and shallow ravines, talus slopes and rockfalls.  The area is further diversified by a branch stream, O'Roarke Draft, that has cut a narrow gorge from the east.  Aspects box the compass from high, dry western exposures on cliffs and mountain spurs to moist and shady north-facing slopes along O'Roarke Draft.  This varied topography and soils enriched by limestone are most conspicuously expressed in the diverse forests and plant communities that are the major subjects of this report.         </P><P>Although our studies thus far have been little more than a reconnaissance, almost 400 species of vascular plants have been identified.  Included are more than 70 woody species and 25 ferns. Of special interest are State rare species such as Millet Grass (<I>Milium effusum</I>), Ginseng (<I>Panax quinquifolius</I>), Great Indian Plantain (<I>Cacalia muhlenbergii</I>) and Butternut (<I>Juglans cinerea</I>).  Also found here is Grays Lily (<I>Lilium grayi</I>), a southern Appalachian endemic that is very rare throughout its range.  Millet Grass is a disjunct northern species usually found only at high elevations but which thrives here, perhaps due to unusually rich soil.  Both Butternut and Grays Lily are classified as C2 under the Endangered Species Act.  Other uncommon species, a number of which are indicators of a calcareous environment, include Large-flowered Bellwort (<I>Uvularia grandiflora</I>), Sharp-lobe Hepatica (<I>Hepatica  acutiloba</I>), Goldie's Fern (<I>Dryopteris goldiana</I>), Bulbiferous Bladder Fern (<I>Cystopteris  bulbifera</I>), the sedges <I>Carex albursina</I>  and<I> C. hirtifolia</I>  and Arborvit&aelig; (<I>Thuja  occidentalis</I>).         </P><P>In mentioning species here the general rule followed is to give the common name only for well-known trees and shrubs.  For herbs and less well-known woody plants, both common and scientific names are given on first mention and only the common name subsequently.  Exceptions are certain species and monotypic genera with no common names or with cumbersome common names.  Thus Indian Cucumber-root (<I>Medeola  virginiana</I>) is simplified to<I> Medeola</I>  and the grass<I> Brachyelytrum erectum  </I>to <I>Brachyelytrum</I>.</P></ul><B><P >The Flood Plain</B><B><br>Source Walks: 6-9-96, 6-22-96, 7-24-96, 8-2-96 and 9-15-96</P><ul></B><P>In the area of interest the flood plain of Back Creek occupies chiefly the vicinity of the large bend along which the Blowing Springs Campground is located.  Elsewhere it is attenuated and forms merely a narrow strip between the river bluffs and the normal water level.  Much of the forest and native vegetation here has been cut and the land converted to lawns or non-native species.  However natives remain dominant, although many are early successionary in character.  Because drainage is generally good, except during the short duration flooding, many of the same species occur as on the upland.</P><P>Among canopy trees that particularly characterize the flood plain and appear virtually confined to it, are American Elm <I>(Ulmus  americana</I>), Black Willow (<I>Salix nigra</I>), the alien White Willow (<I>S. alba</I>), some large, and Sycamore.  Of wider, and frequently upland occurrence as well, are Slippery Elm (<I>Ulmus rubra</I>), Black Walnut, Butternut, Black Maple (<I>Acer nigrum</I>), Sugar Maple, White Ash, American and White Basswoods, Black Gum, White and Northern Red Oaks and an occasional Canada Hemlock (<I>Tsuga canadensis</I>).  Typical of the understory is Muscletree (<I>Carpinus caroliniana</I>), but Paw Paw (<I>Asimina triloba</I>) occurs in places.  Characteristic shrubs are Ninebark (<I>Physocarpus opulifolius</I>), Smooth Alder (<I>Alnus serrulata</I>), Shrubby St. Johns-wort (<I>Hypericum prolificum</I>), Pasture Rose (<I>Rosa carolina</I>), Silky Dogwood (<I>Cornus amomum</I>), Bladdernut (<I>Staphylea trifolia</I>), Leatherwood (<I>Dirca palustris</I>) and Black Elderberry (<I>Sambucus canadensis</I>).  The alien shrub Autumn Olive (<I>El&aelig;agnus umbellata</I>) is also abundant in places.  In addition, a very little Winterberry Holly (<I>Ilex verticillata</I>) and Striped Maple (<I>Acer pensylvanicum </I>) occur.  Vines are represented by River Grape (<I>Vitis riparia</I>), Winter Grape (<I>Vitis vulpina</I>) as well as both native and alien Bittersweets (<I>Celastrus  scandens</I>  and <I>C.  orbiculata</I>  respectively).</P><P>Characteristic herbs of the flood plain are the ubiquitous Wingstem (<I>Verbesina alternifoli</I>a), Small Yellow Crownbeard (<I>V. occidentalis</I>), Crooked-stem Aster (<I>Aster prenanthoide</I>s), Panicled Aster (<I>A. simplex</I>), Arrow-leaf Aster (<I>Aster</I>  <I>sagittifolius </I>),Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<I>Solidago rugosa</I>), Late Goldenrod (<I>S.</I> <I>gigantea</I>), Grass-leaved Goldenrod (<I>Euthamia  graminifolia</I>),Common Joe-pye Weed (<I>Eupatorium fistulosum</I>), Thin-leaved Sunflower (<I>Helinanthus  decapetalus</I>), Tall Coneflower (<I>Rudbeckia laciniata</I>), Golden Ragwort (<I>Senecio aureus</I>), Cardinal Flower (<I>Lobelia cardinalis</I>), Great Blue Lobelia (<I>L. siphilitica</I>), Virginia Knotweed (<I>Polygonum virginianum</I>), Climbing False Buckwheat (<I>P</I>. <I>scandens</I>), Arrowleaf Tearthumb (<I>P. sagittatum</I>), Spotted Jewelweed (<I>Impatiens capensis</I>), Pallid Jewelweed (<I>I. pallida</I>), Fringed Loosestrife (<I>Lysimachia ciliata</I>), Rough Bedstraw (<I>Galium asprellum</I>), Stiff Marsh Bedstraw (<I>G. obtusum</I>), Smooth Hedge Nettle (<I>Stachys tenuifolia</I>), Meadow Garlic (<I>Allium canadense</I>), White Vervain (<I>Verbena urticifolia</I>), Bur Cucumber (<I>Sicyos angulatus</I>), Villous and Riparian Wild Ryes (<I>Elymus villosus  </I>and<I> E. riparius</I>), Bottlebrush Grass (<I>Hystrix  patula</I>), Deer-tongue Grass (<I>Panicum clandestinum</I>), Fowl Mannagrass (<I>Glyceria  striata</I>), White Grass (<I>Leersia virginica</I>), the alien Rough Bluegrass (<I>Poa trivialis</I>), Burreed (<I>Sparganium americanum</I>), the sedges <I>Scirpus vallidus</I>, <I>S. expansus</I>  and <I>Carex lupulina</I>, Scouring Rush (<I>Equisetum hyemale</I>) (which on sandy bars forms large colonies), Common Horsetail (<I>E. arvense</I>), Sensitive Fern (<I>Onoclea sensibilis</I>), Tree Moss (<I>Climacium americanum</I>) and Thallus liverworts, including <I>Conocephalum conicum</I>.  Less characteristic are such species as Three-seeded Mercury (<I>Acalyphia  rhomboidea</I>) and the alien Soapwort (<I>Saponaria  officinalis</I>).  Of the Wild Ryes, <I>Elymus  villosus </I>is present in two forms, including the common villous form, as well as the rarer, almost glabrous form <I>arkansanus</I>.</P><P>Flood plain species noted without specific reference to location were Wood Reed Grass (<I>Cinna  arundinacea </I>), Yellow Sneezeweed (<I>Helenium  autumnale </I>), Beggar Tick (<I>Bidens cernua</I>), Rosinweed (<I>Silphium  trifoliatum</I>), Old Witch Grass (<I>Panicum capillare </I>), Barnyard Grass (<I>Echinochloa crus-gali </I>), alien Yellow Foxtail (<I>Setaria glauca </I>), Lovage (<I>Ligusticum canadense </I>), alien Sow Thistle (<I>Sonchus asper</I>), Fireweed (<I>Erechtites  hieracifolia</I>), Blue-eyed Grass (<I>Sisyrinchium  montanum </I>), Stickseed (<I> Hackelia  virginiana </I>), Pennsylvania pellitory (<I> Parietaria  pensylvanica </I>), Sanicle (<I>Sanicula marilandica</I>), Steel's Meadowrue (<I> Thalictrum steeleanum </I>) and Allegheny Blackberry (<I>Rubus allegheniensis</I>).</P><P>Although no systematic observations were made of flood plain fauna, on 9-15-96 Tiger Swallowtail Butterfly (<I>Papilio glaucus</I>) clusters were seen at the stream edge as were Bumblebees and Silver Spotted Skippers (<I>Epargyreus  clarus</I>) on Joe-pye Weed.  On this same day several Catbirds (<I>Dumetella  carolinensis</I>) called from heavy cover while a small band of Wood Thrushes (<I>Hylocichla  mustelina</I>), now silent, boldly foraged near the observer.  Also, although the Campground Terrace weather was partly cloudy and cool, many Bumblebees even in the late afternoon visited still-blooming Wingstem and Katydids sang in evening chorus.</P></ul><B><P>Flood Plain and Stream Addendum for April, May, July and September, 1997</P><ul><P></B>The cold stream water of April showed few signs of animal life except larger fish and small crustaceans and insect larvae under rocks. However Meadow Spikemoss (<I>Selaginella  apoda</I>) was seen there, as were Bluebells (<I>Mertensia  virginica</I>) blooming along the shore. Some species noted on the flood plain on 5-30-97 were Reed Canary Grass (<I>Phalaris  arundiacea </I>), Wild Crabapple (<I>Malus  coronaria</I>), White Willow, the fungus <I>Polyporus</I>  <I>squamosus</I>  on a Sycamore, American Redstart warblers (<I>Setophaga ruticilla </I>) in low shrubs, Cedar Waxwings (<I>Bombycilla  cedrorum</I>) in treetops and numerous Swallowtail Butterflies. On 5-31-97 a night foray was made to a seep area on the floodplain at the campground. Found here were Spring Salamander (<I>Gyrinophilus porphyriticus </I>), Long-tailed Salamander (<I>Eurycea  longicauda</I>), Seal Salamander (<I> Desmognathus  monticola </I>), Mud Puppy (<I>Necturus  maculosus </I>), Northern Leopard Frog (<I> Rana  pipiens </I>) and an Eatern Ribbon Snake (<I>Thamnophis  sauritus</I>). On 7-8-97 small coiled gastropods and two inch (5 cm) fish were conspicuous near shore, with schools of the latter darting in and out of small embayments between large rocks. By 9-26-97 the gastropod population had increased greatly and was accompanied by swarms of tiny insects moving rapidly above the water surface. Also, at that time a group of about a dozen ten inch (25 cm) long suckers of an unidentified species were observed lying in a riffle. The measured pH of stream water on that September day was about 7.0. Additional species observed downstream beyond the fourth bend on 9-27-97 were Royal Fern (<I>Osmunda  regalis </I>), Ground Nut (<I>Apios  americana </I>) and Marsh Fern (<I>Thelypteris  palustris </I>), with the latter forming a large patch with sedges at the stream edge among cobbles and boulders. Birds seen or heard on this day included Towhees (<I>Pipilo  erythrophthalmus </I>)and Catbirds.</P><P></P></ul><B><P >Campground Terrace<br></B><B>Source Walks: 5-15-93, 6-18-96, 6-23-96, 9-15-96 and other occasions</P><ul></B><P>The river terrace remnant, a little more than an acre (0.4 ha) in area, rises about 20 ft (6 meters) above the flood plain at the base of a mountain spur.  It doubtless was once occupied by an impressive mesic forest, and although the existing stand is secondary, it is noteworthy still.  The canopy trees which shelter the charmingly situated camp sites, are dominated by imposing Tuliptree, a number which exceed 2 ft (0.6 meters) dbh.  Black Walnut is almost as large.  There are also large Slippery Elm and Northern Red Oak while Pignut, Bitternut and Shagbark Hickories, White and Black Oaks are smaller.  A significant feature is the abundance here of Black Maple, which although not large, seems to thrive in what appears to be calcareous soil.  Only White Ash seedlings and one small Black Gum were seen, and while present, Beech appears confined to the terrace edge where the soil is probably more leached and acidic.  The understory is once again dominated by Muscletree but Red Bud and Flowering Dogwood are also common, and there is a little Thornless Hawthorn (<I>Crataegus  </I>sp).  Spice Bush is by far the most common shrub but it is accompanied by Witch Hazel, Black Haw Viburnum (<I>Viburnum prunifolium</I>) and Black Raspberry (<I>Rubus occidentalis </I>).  Maple leaf Viburnum (<I>Viburnum acerifolium</I>) and Flame Azalea (<I>Rhododendron calendulaceum</I>) appear to be confined to the western edge and the northwest end of the terrace where they may be associated with siliceous rocks.  Poison Ivy and Virginia Creeper vines are abundant throughout, and Canada Moonseed (<I>Menispermum canadense</I>) flourishes in the richest soil area at the base of a colluvial slope.</P><P>The ground cover consists of a great variety of herbs which, however, were not inventoried in detail.  Among the most common are Sweet Cicely (<I>Osmorhiza</I>  spp.), Spring Avens (<I>Geum vernum</I>), Horse Balm (<I>Collinsonia</I>  <I>canadensis</I>), Virginia Waterleaf (<I>Hydrophyllum  virginianum</I>), Tall Bellflower (<I>Campanulla  americana</I>), Thimbleweed (<I>Anemone  virginiana</I>), Black Cohosh (<I>Cimicifuga  racemosa</I>), <I>Brachyelytrum</I>  Grass, Clustered Snakeroot (<I>Sanicula</I>  <I>gregaria</I>), and particularly Honewort (<I>Cryptot&aelig;nia  canadensis</I>). Wood Betony (<I>Pedicularis canadensis</I>) appears to be concentrated in the northwest end of the terrace and may be associated with silica-rich rock.  Of great interest here is Millet Grass (<I>Milium  effusum</I>), a northern disjunct on the Natural Heritage Program lists of state-rare plants.  Although it is usually restricted to high elevations, its occurrence here may be related to favorable soil chemistry.  It is quite abundant and appears to seed prolifically on the terrace.  Another unfamiliar is Corn Salad (<I>Valerianella  umbilicata</I>).</P><P>Activities at the campground do not lend themselves to careful observations of fauna.  A background activity of birds, including calls and sightings of Ravens (<I> Corvus corax </I>) Crow-mobbing of raptors and familiar bird songs were common during the day, while Barred Owls (<I> Strix varia</I>) were sometimes heard at night, as on 7-7-96, when tiny biting Black Flies assured wakefulness.  Through August the area was graced by strikingly-patterned and beautiful Hickory Tussock Moth (<I>Halisidota  cary&aelig;</I>) larvae on every tree trunk and picnic table.  Scarcely more unusual was the sighting on the evening of 9-15-96 of a small, very dark Toad (probably a<I> Bufo  americanus</I>) hopping among dead leaves -the stuff not of Marlin Perkins but of real life!</P><center><p><img src="blowmil.jpg" width=400 height=535 border="12"><br><font size=-1 color=666666><i>Milium effusum</i>, Blowing Springs, Va. at Campground Terrace.</font></center><p><center><p><img src="blowter.jpg" width=294 height=418 border="12"><br><font size=-1 color=666666>Blowing Springs Campground Terrace</font></center><p></ul><B><P>Terrace Addendum for May, June, July and September, 1997<br><ul></B>Our morning of 5-31-97 was cheered by the calls of Baltimore Orioles (<I>Icterus glabula </I>), Red-bellied Woodpeckers (<I>Melanerpes carolinus </I>), Towhees, Red-eyed Vireos, as well as many other birds, including various warblers. Here also Flame Azalea (at the terrace-floodplain edge) and Alternate-leaf Dogwood were both in bloom and Black Cherry was noted for the first time at the terrace edge. Other species noted were Sylvan Bluegrass (<I> Poa sylvestris</I>), <I>Carex hitchcockiana, C. cephalophora, Scirpus verecundus</I>, Golden Alexanders (<I> Zizia aurea </I>), Bowmans Root (<I> Gillenia trifoliata</I>), the alien bedstraw <I>Galium parisiense</I>, a <I>Psathyrella</I>  fungus on a black, half inch (1.3 cm), stubby scarab beetle and Virginia Waterleaf in full bloom.</P><P>Of special interest here is the base of the steep colluvial slope that borders the terrace on the east. There is evidence, in the form of fragments of limestone and other rocks, that soil creep is active on this slope, with subsoil and rock constituents brought near the surface and thus enriching the root zone. The relatively fresh nature of limestone fragments in this soil was revealed by their effervescence to acid. However a pH determination on 9-26-97 yielded a value of only 6.2 for the soil between the fragments, indicating leaching had occurred.</P><P>Here on 5-31-97 the skullcap <I>Scutellaria parvula  </I>and the calciphile Seneca Snakeroot (<I>Polygalla  senega</I>) were in bloom. A spot inventory in the same area on 7-8-97 yielded Black Walnut, America Basswood (mostly small), Black Maple (some large), Slippery Elm, a Chinquapin Oak (<I>Quercus  muehlenbergii </I>), abundant Bitternut Hickory, Spice Bush, Witch Hazel, Redbud, Virginia Creeper, Canada Moonseed vine, Common Greenbrier, abundant Hog Peanut, Smooth Sweet Cicely (<I>Osmorhiza</I>  <I>longistylis </I>), <I>Brachyelytrum  </I>grass, Bottlebrush grass, Pallid Jewelweed, Honewort, Horse Balm, the tick-trefoil <I>Desmodium glutinosum</I>, Four-leaved Yam, White Avens (in bloom), C<I>arex sparganoides, C. digitallis</I>  and Canada Brome grass. Also seen were a red Eft of the Eastern Newt (<I>Notophthalmus  viridescens</I>) and a black and yellow millipede with almond odor.Conspicuous quite generally on the terrace were numerous skippers, notably the Silver Spotted (<I>Epargyreus  clarus</I>), although unidentified species were common  as well.</P><P>On 7-8-97, a pleasantly warm day on the terrace, it was noted that Wood Thrush and Red-eyed Vireos (<I>Vireo  olivaceus </I>) vocalized almost throughout the day, but appeared to pause in the early afternoon. On this day Towhees, Tufted Titmice (<I>Parus </I> <I>bicolor</I>), Crows and Ravens were also heard, although these were more active in the morning. An additional feature of interest was how Millet Grass, then in seed, flourished here in quite deep shade. Finally, some other species identified here in September were Tall Goldenrod (<I> Solidago altissima</I>), Canada Goldenrod (<I>S.  canadensis   </I>var <I>scabra </I>), Gaura (<I>Gaura  biennis </I>) and the Wood Blewit fungus (<I> Lepista  nuda </I>).</P></ul><B><P >The River Trail and Associated Slopes</B><B><br>Source Walks: as referred to in the text</B>.</P><ul><P>This trail, which extends downstream along the left bank of Back Creek, passes through a remarkable sequence of rock types, topography, and plant communities.  The distance along the trail covered in our brief surveys is a little less than a mile (1.6 km) from the campground to the national forest boundary.  Included are five river bends, beginning with the large one at the camp ground.  The trail is located on an abandoned road that was cut into the river bank about 10 feet (3 meters) above the mean water level and in a number of places these cuts expose rock ledges that have with time been covered with vegetation that reflects the rock type and chemistry.  There is a great variation in the steepness and configuration of the slopes above the trail, ranging from gentle ravines with deep colluvial soil through talus and rock falls to steep ravines and vertical cliffs.  The riparian zone, including the stream itself, is but little discussed here, but consists of a narrow flood plain selvage, steep banks, cobble and boulder flats as well as a beautiful and distinctive waterfall that marks the second bend.  It is here that on 7-24-96 an entranced artist observed a young Black Bear come to the waters edge twice near mid-day.  Another point of interest along the river trail was the almost inevitable occurrence on each of our visits throughout the summer of loud woodpecker drumming on a resonant snag across the river.  It is likely that this was a Pileated Woodpecker (<I> Dryocopus  pileatus </I>) monitoring his territory.</P><P>Preliminary observations seem to indicate that the river bends have been accentuated by erosion and dissolution of limestones, which forms cliffs and steep slopes outside the bends.  Other, more siliceous rocks, appear to be concentrated between and within the bends and form gentler slopes.  It is these structural and erosional manifestations that set the stage not only for floral diversity and distribution but for the general ecology as well.</P><P>The river trail begins at a metal National Forest gate at the edge of the flood plain in an area that includes flood plain-type vegetation and, on the adjacent road bank and mountain slope, upland forest species as well.  While the area is dominated by the latter, flood plain representatives are American Elm, abundant Paw Paw as well as a number of herbs.  An important upland tree making its first appearance in our inventory is Black Birch, a species that maintains its abundance all along the trail in a variety of habitats.  Also met first here are such upland shrubs as Wild Hydrangea (<I>Hydrangea  arborescens</I>), Flowering Raspberry (<I>Rubus  odoratus</I>) and American Hazelnut (<I>Corylus  americana</I>), Common Greenbrier (<I>Smilax  rotundifolia</I>) vine is also present.  Herbs previously encountered either on the floodplain or on the terrace are Bur Cucumber, White Vervain, Wingstem, Jewelweed, Crooked-Stem Aster, Tall Coneflower, Thin-leaved Sunflower, Virginia Knotweed, White, Bottlebrush, Millet and Wild Rye grasses, Horse Balm and Honewort.  New species, some of which are most at home on the moist shady bank, are Blue Wood Aster (<I>Aster cordifolius</I>), Calico Aster (<I>A. lateriflorus</I>), White Wood Aster (<I>A. divaricatus</I>), Wreath Goldenrod (<I>Solidago  c&aelig;sia</I>), Broadleaf Goldenrod (<I>S. flexicaulis</I>), Whorled Loosetrife (<I>Lysimachia  quadrifolia</I>), Basil Balm <I>(Monarda  clinopodia</I>), Clearweed (<I>Pilea  pumila</I>), the tick-trefoil <I>Desmodium glutinosum</I>, Wild Ginger (<I>Asarum  canadense</I>), Shining Bedstraw (<I>Galium  concinnum</I>), Bloodroot (<I>Sanguinaria  canadensi</I>s), Early Meadowrue (<I>Thalictrum  dioicum</I>), Lopseed <I>(Phryma  leptostachya</I>), Enchanter's Nightshade <I>(Circ&aelig;a</I>  <I>quadriusulcat</I>a), Wild Geranium (<I>Geranium  maculatum</I>), Hairy Disporum (<I>Disporum  lanuginosum</I>), Poke Milkweed (<I>Asclepias  exhaltata</I>), Common Solomon Seal or "Many Knees" <I>(Polygonatum  biflorum</I>), Downy Solomons Seal or "Many Knees"<I>(P. pubescens</I>), Indian Turnip (<I>Aris&aelig;ma  triphyllum</I>), American Spikenard (<I>Aralia  racemosa</I>), Four-leaved Yam (<I>Dioscorea  quaternat</I>a), Columbine (<I>Aquilegia  canadensis</I>) and Large-flowered Bellwort (<I>Uvularia</I>  <I>grandiflora</I>), the last named being an indicator of rich calcareous soil.  Additional grasses are the forest "bluegrass" <I>Poa  alsoides</I>, Canada Brome Grass (<I>Bromus purgans</I>) and Nodding Fescue (<I>Festuca obtusa</I>).</P><center><p><img src="blowmay.jpg" width=400 height=262 border="12"><br><font size=-1 color=666666>Blowing Springs, Canada Mayflower patch on River Trail</font></center><p><P>The microhabitats of moist bank and springy roadbed also favor diverse assemblages of sedges such as <I>Carex digitalis</I>, <I>C. blanda, C.</I> <I>appalachica</I>, <I>C. radiata, C. communis, C. platyphylla, C. sparganioides, C. </I>squarosa, the regionally uncommon <I>C</I>. <I>hirtifolia  </I>and the calciphile <I>C.</I> <I>granularis</I>.</P><P>Ferns were also well represented by Christmas Fern (<I>Polystichum</I> <I>acrostichoides</I>), Marginal Shield Fern <I>(Dryopteris  marginalis</I>), Interrupted Fern <I>(Osmunda  claytoniana</I>) and the weakly calcophile Maidenhair Fern (<I>Adiantum  pedatum</I>).  In sum, the general richness and character of the flora here indicates that it is under direct influence of the limestone rock that dominates this section of the trail.</P><P>Not far beyond the gate the almost directly west-tending trail enters an area of significant roadcut through a ledge of hard quartzite. This rock was originally sandstone in which the sand grains -which are still visible with a hand lens - were tightly cemented by secondary silica.  This quartzite is also present upslope above the ledge but largely as talus.  Plant communities associated with the quartzite share many species with those developed on limestone as previously described, but there are subtle and interesting differences and a number of species occur here that are absent on the latter.  It should be noted that aspect is almost due north here.  A spot inventory of the ledge and immediately below along the trail yielded the following where several immature (about 6 inch/ 15 cm) dbh Hemlock occur:  Black Birch, Slippery Elm, seedlings of Sugar Maple and Beech, Wild Hydrangea, Great Rhododendron (<I>Rhododendron maximum</I>),  Poison Ivy and Virginia Creeper are associated woody plants and vines. A little Red Maple also occurs along the trail. Herbs were Goat's Beard (<I>Aruncus dioicus</I>), American Spikenard, Blue Cohosh (<I>Caulophyllum  thalictroides</I>), Hooked Crowfoot (<I>Ranunculus  recurvatus</I>), White Wood Aster, Hairy Disporum, Marginal and Intermediate Shield (<I>Dryopteris  intermedia</I>) Ferns, Christmas Fern, the grass <I>Poa alsodes  </I>and Virgins Bower (<I>Clematis virginiana</I>).</P><P>A little farther along the trail, and still on or near the quartzite ledge, where more Hemlock occurs, are found Bitternut Hickory, White Ash, White Clintonia (<I>Clintonia  umbellulata</I>), Large-flowered Trillium (<I>Trillium</I>  <I>grandiflorum</I>), Black Cohosh, Hog Peanut <I>(Amphicarpa bracteata</I>) and Sensitive Fern.  The quartzite ledge appears to terminate gradually after about 1000 ft (300 meters) as scattered fragments mingled with limestone.  </P><P>A survey was also done of the (largely talus) slope above the quartzite ledge exposure.  A traverse on 8-2-96 began at the western terminus of the ledge and extended eastward above the ledge to about the 1800 ft (550 meter) level.  The canopy here consists of mature Sugar Maple, Northern Red Oak, Black Birch, Tuliptree, Shagbark and Pignut Hickories, Cucumbertree, White Ash, Beech, a few Black Locust and scattered small clumps and individuals of Hemlock.  Some Hemlock associcated with large Northern Red Oak ranged up to 28 inches (0.7 meters) dbh and one of these was festooned with a large grape vine.  There appeared to be little or no Hemlock reproduction, with few seedlings or saplings under ten inches (25 cm) dbh in this forest.  The understory and shrub layer is sparse but includes some Muscletree, Great Rhododendron, Mountain Laurel and Witch Hazel. The herb layer, which is developed on and amidst the numerous quartzite flags and talus blocks, contains a fair sprinkling of acid-soil species such as Partridge Berry (<I>Mitchella repens</I>), Wild Sarsaparilla (<I>Aralia nudicaulis</I>), Creeping Phlox (<I>Phlox stolonifera</I>), <I>Medeola  </I>and Round-lobe Hepatica (<I>Hepatica  americana</I>).  Frequently Partridge Berry is concentrated at the base of Hemlock.  Other herbs and vines noted are Virginia Creeper, Hispid Greenbriar (<I>Smilax hispida</I>), Mealy Bellwort (<I>Uvularia  perfoliata</I>) (here replacing the Large-flowered Bellwort of limestone substrates), Hog Peanut, White Snakeroot (<I>Eupatorium rugosum</I>), Indian Turnip, Black Cohosh, Hairy Disporum, Four-leaved Yam, Curtis Goldenrod (<I>Solidago  curtisii</I>), Wild Liquorice (<I>Galium  circ&aelig;zans</I>), Lance-leaved Wild Liquorice (<I>G. lanceolatum</I>), Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<I>G. triflorum</I>), White Wood Aster, Sweet Cicely, Wild Ginger, Clearweed, Gall-of-the-earth (<I>Prenanthes</I>   sp.), Christmas Fern, Mariginal Shield Fern, New York Fern (<I>Thelypteris  noveboracensis</I>), Maidenhair Fern and the sedges <I>Carex platyphylla</I>  and <I>C. pensylvanica</I>.  Fern Moss (<I>Thuidium delicatulum</I>) was abundant and apparently the most common moss.</P><P>Few birds were seen or heard on the traverse.  However woodland spiders of the spiny <I>Micranthena</I>  type were seen, as were small fleeting white moths and large brownish crane flies.  A four inch (10 cm) millipede patterned with dark blue and (narrow) maroon bands (<I>Narceus americanus  </I>perhaps) was also noted.</P><P>Although the forest on this talus slope is quite rich and diverse, with many of the same species as those developed on calcareous substrate, it is clearly less so as shown particularly by the relative sparseness of the understory shrub and herb layers and its complement of species adapted to acid soils.</P><P>If the traverse is extended farther west along the river trail, beyond the range of the quartzite ledge, one soon encounters a shallow ravine extending up slope.  While the canopy here is essentially the same as that in the vicinity of the quartzite, Tuliptree seems to increase and the understory, shrub and herb layers show greater densities.  Among new species encountered along the trail are the sedges<I> Carex frankii  </I>and <I>C. vulpenoidea</I>, the Wood Rush <I>Luzula acuminata</I>  and the calciphile Bulbiferous Bladder Fern (<I>Cystopteris bulbifera</I>).  There is also an apparent increase in Maidenhair Fern and  soon Sharplobe Hepatica (<I>Hepatica  acutiloba</I>) appears as well.  In a rich depression with abundant Tuliptree, Northern Red Oak, Muscletree, Sharplobe Hepatica and other herbs these are joined by graceful fronds of Silvery Athyrium or Glade Fern (<I>Athyrium thelypteroides</I>).  Here on 6-12-96, on a low shelf of the forest floor, amidst a thick blanket of dead leaves, we discovered the nest of an Ovenbird (<I>Seiurus aurocapillus</I>) with young.  As is customary, the bird engaged in vigorous distraction display before we moved on.  It is also on this section of the trail on 10-13-96 that a mature Bald Eagle (<I> Haliaeetus</I>  <I>leucocephalus </I>) was observed flying downstream above the water at tree top level.</P><P> A little beyond this depression the ravine wall rises steeply as part of the low spur that occupies the interior of the second river bend. Here the river trail encounters a short road cut exposure of intriguing rocks.  In order, from east to west these consist of massive, dense, fine-grained dark blue limestone grading gradually into thinner-bedded rock of mixed character and finally into cross-bedded sandstone.  Since the latter is honeycombed and friable it probably contains calcareous cement (and later confirmed as such).  What follows is a spot inventory of the flora found on and immediately below the rock exposure as a whole on 7-24-96, bearing in mind, however, that the greatest concentration of species occurred on or near the limestone part of the exposure.</P><P>The canopy immediately above and near the exposure is dominated by Black Birch, but with Northern Red Oak, Sugar Maple, Small White Ash and a small Butternut.  Shrubs on or near the rock are Witch Hazel, Wild Hydrangea, Spice Bush, and Flowering Raspberry.  Virginia Creeper and Poison Ivy are abundant vine species.  Hog Peanut is the dominant herb, but the rock and near vicinity are host to a very diverse assemblage of other species for such a small area.  Found here are Hairy Disporum, Smooth Sweet Cicely, <I>Carex platyphylla</I>,<I> Brachyelytrum</I>  grass, Columbine (<I>Aquiegia </I> <I>canadensis </I>), Enchanter's Nightshade, American Spikenard, White Snakeroot, Broad-leaf and Curtis Goldenrods, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Plume Lily (<I>Smilacina racemosa</I>), Clearweed, Indian Turnip, Honewort, White Wood Aster, Goat's Beard, Foam Flower (<I>Tiarella cordifolia</I>), a Meadowrue (<I>Thalictrum</I>  sp) Large Flowered Trillium, Christmas and Marginal Shield Ferns.  Markedly calcophile species are Sharplobe Hepatica, Large-flowered Bellwort, Maidenhair and Bulbiferous Bladder Ferns and, on the rock surface, Walking Fern (<I>Camptosorus  rhizophyllus</I>).  Where most exposed to light, the dense, dark limestone surface is covered by a crust of a whitish-green lichen.</P><P>The slope above the limestone rock exposure in the road cut is covered by a rich forest and flora comparable to that at the roadcut, although there appear to be fewer species, perhaps as a consequence of lower light intensity away from the trail.  In addition to those noted at the roadcut, canopy species on the slope also include Shagbark Hickory and, higher on the slope, some Beech as well.  Serviceberry (<I>Amelanchier</I>  sp) also occurs in the understory.  In one place Sharplobe Hepatica grows in close proximity to a small Beech, perhaps indicating microhabitat in a constricted acid stability field of the Hepatica.  Hispid Greenbrier, White Wood Aster, Wild Liquorice, Gall-of-the-Earth, Four-leaved Yam, Curtis Goldenrod, Blood Root, <I>Brachyelytrum  </I>grass, Villous Wild Rye, the Panic Grass <I>Panicum  latifolium</I>  and <I>Carex platyphylla</I>  are some common species here.  Of greater interest were Wild Onion (<I>Allium  cernuum</I>), then in spectacular bloom, and Bunch Flower (<I>Melanthium  parviflorum</I>), just beginning to bloom.  Higher up the slope a sedge, a form of <I>Carex laxiflora</I>, grows in numerous closely-spaced clumps.  Fern Moss is abundant on this slope as well, and in places is intergrown with what appears to be <I>Cladonia  </I>lichen.</P><P>As along the river trail, there appears to be a gradual transition in flora between this spur slope, with a dominantly limestone substrate and the quartzite talus slope to the east.  In the latter direction Sharplobe Hepatica gives way to Roundlobe and most conspicuously  such herbs as Christmas Fern and Hog Peanut decrease greatly as does general herb density. Chemical analysis of soil samples collected in the two areas on 8-19-96 are shown in Table 1.  Sample BS-ac, which represents the dominantly calcareous slope of the spur, was taken from near Sharplobe Hepatica whereas BS-am, which represents the more silica-rich environment of the quartzite talus slope, was taken from near the Roundlobe species.  Although the gross chemistry of the two samples differs little, that from the quartzite talus is clearly more acid.  It should however be mentioned that a patch of Bulbiferous Bladder Fern occurred less than 15  feet (4.6 meters) down-slope from BS-am and Roundlobe Hepatica grew right to the edge of this calcophile fern.  It may be that this fern patch represents a microhabitat created by an erratic block of limestone at some depth below the soil.  Thus the sample site was chosen to extract the most data and interest!</P><P>A microfaunal encounter near this site was a small tree frog on the forest floor.  The color of this frog was light greenish-gray with a dark Y on its back (bottom toward tail), dark slashes on its side and a conspicuous bar through the eye.</P><P>Continuing along the river trail beyond the road cut rock exposure, the spur gives way to another shallow ravine on the left while the waterfall is to the right.  The soil in this ravine appears deep, with few rock outcrops and little talus.  As elsewhere, the canopy is dominated by Tuliptree, Northern Red Oak and Black Birch.  However further up the ravine Beech averaging around 1 ft (30 cm) dbh becomes abundant.  There are also scattered Hemlock and a large specimen of the latter species, with a colony of Patridge Berry at its base, is conspicuous near the trail.  The leaf mat in the ravine is quite heavy and acid-soil species such as Partridge Berry, <I>Medeola  </I>and Roundlobe Hepatica occur, especially at the bases of Beech and Hemlock.  Christmas Fern is abundant and accompanied by<I> Brachyelytrium</I> grass, Mealy Bellwort, Black Cohosh, Indian Turnip, <I>Carex laxiflora</I>, the root parasite Squawroot (<I>Conopholis americana</I>) and the small Coralroot Orchid (<I>Corallorhiza odontorhiza</I>).  It may be significant that some of the Hepatica here show leaf shapes intermediate to the Round and Sharplobe species.</P><P>As the trail rounds the second river bend and passes the waterfall, it heads almost due south on its way to the third bend.  Although degraded by human overuse, the falls area is the site not only of interesting rock exposures but also of a number of biologic communities and microhabitats related to the stream.  Ninebark, Smooth Alder and Shrubby St. Johns-wort are dominant shrubs at the falls and the cobble and rubble bars above, but there is also a little Winterberry Holly and rare (for this area) Striped Maple.  Immediately below the falls the alien Bittersweet, <I>Cleastrus orbiculatus</I>,  shares the bank with shrubs, Riparian Wild Rye, other grasses and sedges. Above the falls on cobble bars and among coarse rubble that lines the shore there are luxuriant stands of Sensitive Fern, sedges, including probably<I> Carex torta</I>, and other plants such as American Germander (<I>Teucrium canadense</I>) and Yellow Pimpernel (<I>T&aelig;nidia integerrima</I>).  Some large angular blocks of limestone or calacareous sandstone here are covered by intergrowths of Wild Stonecrop (<I>Sedum ternatum</I>), Tree Moss, other mosses and thallous liverwort, including <I>Conocephalum conicum</I>.  A few Hemlock also occur here where they are subject to stream abrasion during floods.  Unlike their upland brethren they have no complementary Partridge Berry at their bases, perhaps because acid soil formation is prevented by periodic flooding.  Although Sharplobe Hepatica occurs on the bank below the trail here, there appears to be short-range differences of soil chemistry as indicated by such species as Spotted Wintergreen (<I>Chimaphila maculata</I>) and Trout Lily (<I>Erythronium  umbilicatum</I>) that occur along the trail nearby on old road cut debris.</P><center><p><img src="blowfalls.jpg" width=400 height=381 border="12"><br><font size=-1 color=666666>Blowing Springs falls (a little above campground).</font></center><p><P>On the approach to the third river bend the mountain slope gradually steepens and large blocks of fallen rock litter the trail side.  Although Bulbiferous Bladder Fern and other calcophile plants occur, there is little rank growth near the trail.  The opposite is true of the steep slope near the bend crest. There the entire slope is covered with a dense growth of Wood Nettle, Pallid Jewelweed, American Spikenard (to huge size!) and other tall mesic herbs, perhaps in response to springs emerging there.  Both Sugar and Black Maple occur near the trail as do White and American Basswoods.</P><P>Near and at the third bend crest massive steeply-dipping beds of variable-shaded limestone turn the stream bank into a solid rampart, illustrating the powerful scouring action of the river at bend crests. Not far beyond the steep green slope gives way to a vertical cliff of limestone from which grow moderately-sized Arborvit&aelig; (<I>Thuja occidentalis</I>).  Curiously this familiar of northern bogs is virtually confined to such limestone rock habitats along the Appalachian chain, a circumstance which may have a biochemical explanation (Mueller, 1996).  However, beneath the north-facing mountain walls, winter can also linger, as on 4-18-94, when snowbanks still lay here.  As if to drive home the point, this is also the only observed site of Mountain Maple (<I>Acer  spicatum</I>) in the area. A cursory examination of the cliffs for associates of the Arborvit&aelig; disclosed the following calciphile ferns: Maidenhair Spleenwort (<I>Asplenium trichomanes</I>), Rue Spleenwort (<I>A. ruta</I>-<I>muraria</I>) and Purple Cliffbrake (<I>Pell&aelig;a atropurpurera</I>).  Other, more generalist species, were <I>Carex rosa</I>, Prickly Gooseberry (<I>Ribes cynosbati</I>) and Elm-leaf Goldenrod (<I>Solidago ulmifolia</I>), while Hairy Heuchera (<I>Heucher</I>a <I>villosa</I>) grew to large leaf sizes on the dripping lower rocks.</P><P>Not far beyond the cliff a heavy growth of Great Rhododendron (in bloom on 7-7-96) heralds a change in rock type from limestone to sandstone/quartzite once more.  Along the trail and bank ,river-transported limestone fragments extend their influence a bit farther downstream as indicated by attenuated patches of Bulbiferous Bladder Fern.  But this influence soon dies out and the acidity of the sandstone substrate dominates throughout the interior of the fourth river bend and beyond.  Although the canopy here does not differ greatly from that under limestone influence, some characteristic acid soil species are present.  Hemlock is abundant and Red maple, a species absent on limestone, reaches canopy size.  Over a wide area Hay-Scented Fern (<I>Dennst&aelig;dtia punctilobula</I>) and New York Fern form a heavy ground cover beneath the trees.  Along the trail acid soil as well as generalist herbs abound, including Creeping Phlox, Gay Wings (<I>Polygala</I> <I>paucifolia</I>), Creeping Five-leaf (<I>Potentilla canadensis/simplex</I>), Mountain Oat Grass (<I>Danthonia compressa</I>), Philadelphia Fleabane (<I>Erigeron philadelphicus</I>), the sedge <I>Carex debilis</I>, the Panic Grass<I> Panicum latifolium</I> and a few plants each of Hairy Skulcap (<I>Scutellaria elliptica</I>) and Cranefly Orchid (<I>Tipularia discolor</I>).  In places there are beautiful dark green patches of Tree Moss, a species of False Haircap Moss (<I>Atrichum  </I>sp) and many other mosses, while, on trailside blocks of sandstone, these are associated with a little Rock Fern (<I>Polypodium virginianum</I>). In the general vicinity and a little way up slope from the trail a "wildlife opening" created by the Forest Service, and once planted to Autumn Olive, has been taken over by Hercules Club (<I>Aralia spinosa</I>). This succession is clearly the result of preferential browsing of the Autumn Olive by deer.</P><P>Near the crest of the fourth bend, where the aspect is again almost due north, there is an interesting and intriguing, juxtaposition of two distinct plant communities.  Where the trail passes through a patch of Great Rhododendron, forming a linear opening, there is a rare (for this elevation) occurrence of Canada Mayflower (<I>Maianthemum canadense</I>).  This plant occurs in a patch about 65 feet (20 meters) in length and less than half that in width on a relatively flat area for the most part, but also on a gently-sloping bank on the mountain side of the trail .  Other plants associated with Canada Mayflower are New York, Hay-scented and Christmas Fern, Gay Wings, Creeping Five-leaf, a Violet (<I>Viola </I>sp.), Plume Lily, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, White Wood Aster, Spotted Wintergreen, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain Orchid (<I>Goodyera pubescens</I>), Allegheny Fly-back Grass and seedlings of Red Maple, Black Birch, American Basswood, White Ash and Pignut Hickory.  Large trees in the vicinity are Hemlock, Black Birch, Red Maple and Northern Red Oak.  New York and Hay-scented Ferns and Gaywing are concentrated on the mountainside bank of the trail.  Contrasting starkly with this community is one consisting largely of Hog Peanut.  Indeed, this plant and Canada Mayflower were not observed to mingle but are separated by an approximate 10 foot (3 meters) interval in which Creeping Five-leaf dominates.  It thus appears that at least at this site the stability fields - incorporating chemical, physical and biological elements - of the two species are quite different.</P><P>Two soil samples (Table 1) from the vicinity of these communities were taken.  Sample BS-CM represents the flat section of the Canada Mayflower patch while BS-RM was taken from under the Great Rhododendron just up slope.  Unfortunately through oversight no sample was taken from where Hog Peanut occurs (see later, however) .  While both samples are well within the acid range, the pH of BS-CM is higher than one might expect and may signal contamination by carbonate from recent flooding.</P><P>The acid soil communities with their characteristic species and vegetation densities extend downstream to the vicinity of the fifth river bend where limestone again occurs.  Although no detailed inventories were done here, the contact between sandstone and limestone is again apparent from both a change in species and a marked increase in densities, luxuriance and diversity of shrubs and herbs.  Bulbiferous Bladder Fern again appears, as do other calciphiles.  An opportunity was afforded on 4-18-94 to observe the following vernal flora:  Spring Bluets (<I>Houstonia c&aelig;rulia</I>), Great Chickweed (<I>Stellaria pubera</I>), Spring Beauty (<I>Claytonia virginiana</I>), Dutchman's Breeches (<I>Dicentra cucularia</I>), Cut-leaf Toothwort (<I>Dentaria laciniata</I>) and Wake Robin (<I>Trillium erectum</I>), all then in bloom.  The calciphile Shrub Wahoo (<I>Euonymus atropurpurea</I>) was also observed.  Here however, the salutary effect of limestone was again aided by near northern aspect.</P><center><p><img src="blowdirt.jpg" width=400 height=256 border="12"><br><font size=-1 color=666666>Contact of limestone and quartzite on the River Trail.  <i>Uvularia grandiflora</i> (lower left) on limestone and <i>Rhododendron maximum</i> (upper right) on quartzite.</font></center><p></ul><B><P>River Trail Addendum for 4-25-97 and 9-26-97</P><ul><P></B>On a 4-25-97 foray to the area of the second quartzite ledge in the vicinity of the fourth bend we noted Sweet White Violet (<I>Viola  blanda </I>), the Wood Rush <I>Luzula acuminata</I>, the sedge <I>Carex communis</I>  and the moss <I>Hylocomium  brevirostre</I>, a species partial to " ravines next to streams" (Crum and Anderson,1981). Farther along, at the fifth bend, the liverwort <I>Conocephalum  connicum</I> formed large patches on seepy cliff faces. Here, in this limy area, we noted Walking Fern, Dutchman's Breeches, Intermediate Shield Fern, Two-leaved Toothwort (<I>Dentaria diphylla </I>), Canada Violet (<I>Viola canadensis</I>) Miterwort and Foam Flower. A small dark slug was common here.</P><P>On 9-26-97 pH determinations were made of soils from the previously discussed adjacent patches of Hog Peanut and Canada Mayflower. pH in each case was found to be 5.0. It was also found that Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, an associate of Canada Mayflower, occurred with hog Peanut as well. Thus an unkown factor would seem to differentiate the two communities. </P></ul><B><P >Upper an Middle Westerly Slopes<br></B><B>Source Walks: 7-2-96 and 7-6-96</P><ul></B><P>What follows are descriptions of traverses across the southwest to northwest and north slopes above the campground and the quartzite talus slope previously described.  Habitat on these traverses ranged from strongly mesic on the northwest and north slopes to quite xeric on slopes of west and southwest aspects.</P><P>Our 7-2-96 traverse began at the spur-end on the northwest side of the campground terrace.  It ascended to about the 1900 foot (580 meter) level on the southwest-facing slope and curved downward to the southeast end of the campground where it was terminated due to rain showers.  The canopy along the traverse is dominated by Black Oak, Sugar and Black Maples with smaller amounts of Chinquapin Oak,  Pignut Hickory, Cucumbertree, Slippery Elm, Sassafras, Black Locust and Red Mulberry (<I>Morus rubra</I>).  Black Maple and Slippery Elm concentrated on the lower slope, Oaks on the upper and Sugar Maple between.  Understory consists of Flowering Dogwood and Muscletree with Witch Hazel an abundant shrub.  Hog Peanut is by far the most abundant herb, followed by the tick-trefoils <I>Desmodium glutinosum, D. paniculatum, D. cuspidatum  </I>and <I>D.</I> <I>rotundifolium</I>.  Also common or conspicuous were Squaw Weed (<I>Senicio</I>  <I>obovatus</I>), Leather-leaf Meadowrue (<I>Thalictrum  coriaceum</I>), Early Meadowrue (<I>T. dioicum</I>), Revolute Meadowrue (<I>T. revolutum</I>), Wild Liquorice, Wild Onion, Spreading Dogbane (<I>Apcocynum  andros&aelig;mifolium</I>), Butterfly Weed (<I>Asclepias tuberosa</I>), Wild Vetch (<I>Vicia caroliniana</I>), Thimbleweed, Starry Campion (<I>Silene stellata</I>), Basil Balm, Late Purple Aster (<I>Aster  patens</I>), White Aster (<I>A. infirmus </I>), Pale Indian Plantain (<I>Cacalia  atriplicifolia</I>), Rosinweed (<I>Silphium  trifoliatum</I>), Wild Comfrey (<I>Cynoglossum  virginianum</I>), the bush clover <I>Lespedeza  violacea</I>, Virginia Snakeroot (<I>Aristolochia  serpentaria</I>), the panic grasses<I> Panicum  latifolium </I>and <I>P. boscii</I>, <I>Brachyelytrum</I>  grass, <I>Carex platyphylla</I>  and Roundlobe Hepatica.  A type of tree moss of the genus <I>Forsstroemia</I>  occurs on Pignut Hickory on this slope much as on the terrace below.</P><P>Although few rock outcrops were encountered on the traverse, the slope is inferred to be largely limestone terrain because of its location relative to the river bend as well as the general character of the vegetation.  While there is a striking difference between the latter and plant communities in calcareous areas along the river trail, this may be attributed largely to the dryness of this slope with a southwesterly aspect.  Certainly a number of species here  Chinquapin Oak, Squaw Weed, Wild Comfrey and others  are familiar from dry limestone terrain and in the case of Chinquapin Oak, are virtually restricted to it.</P><P>The 7-6-96 traverse extended over a greater distance and elevation range than the above.  It began at the southeast end of the terrace and ascended the slope southeastward to near the 2000 foot (610 meter) level.  It then continued south at this level above the quartzite ledge and talus of the river trail and finally descended through the shallow ravine to the trail.  In what follows, species noted along the traverse are listed in the sequence in which they were recorded in response to salient, time-limited impressions.  Near the start, just above the terrace, Sugar and Black Maples, Black Oak, Tuliptree, a single bush of Wahoo and a large Summer Grape (<I>Vitis &aelig;stivalis</I>) vine on a tree attracted attention.  Then ascending, in succession were noted Dotted St. Johns-wort (<I>Hypericum punctatum</I>), the somewhat uncommon Green Violet (<I>Hybanthes concolor</I>), Lopseed, Roundlobe Hepatica (seemingly increasing upward), Smooth-forked Chickweed (<I>Paronychia canadensis</I>), Shagbark Hickory, a large land snail shell, a single Chinquapin Oak near a limestone outcrop, abundant Sugar Maple, Muscletree, Roundlobe Hepatica, White Oak, Flowering Dogwood,  Pignut Hickory, frequent Scarlet Tanager calls, White Pine, Scattered Hemlock, Tuliptree and abundant Christmas Fern.  At this point a spot inventory of perhaps 0.10 acre (0.04 ha) yielded Tuliptree, Sugar maple, Northern Red Oak, Cucumbertree, Hemlock, Shagbark Hickory, Spice Bush, Green Violet, Maidenhair Fern and the somewhat uncommon sedge <I>Carex amphibola</I>, indicating abundant soil moisture even on this steep slope.</P><P>Aspect here had become rather northerly.  We also encountered our first Hophornbeam <I>(Ostrya virginiana</I>) and then Clearweed, on a well-drained slope in contrast to its usual watery environment on acid soils.  The traverses now began its descent, in the middle reaches of the ravine.  In a zone, perhaps transitional between quartzite and calcareous rocks, abundant Tuliptree was accompanied by a patch of Bulbiferous Bladder Fern, perhaps at the site of a dislodged block of limestone.  Also observed in the area were a burned snag, Muscletree, Flowering Dogwood, Maidenhair Fern, <I>Brachyelytrum</I>  grass, Nodding Fescue, Canada Brome grass, Wild Ginger and Black Cohosh.  A little farther down the ravine Interrupted Fern and generally abundant Hog Peanut were conspicuous, as were the calls of Red-eyed Vireos.  Still farther down, a 28 inch (30 cm) dbh Hemlock was accompanied by White Wood Aster and Roundlobe Hepatica.  Closer to the river trail attention was drawn to a large Shagbark Hickory followed by abundant Sugar Maple, Tuliptree, Basswood and smaller Beech, then by large Beech and smaller Beech just above the trail.</P><P>A feature of this traverse is the wide distribution of Roundlobe Hepatica and the absence of the Sharplobe species even in the vicinity of limestone exposures.  Another is the strong mesic character of the forest, in all probability a consequence of the prevailing northwest to north aspects as distinguished from the west and southwest slopes of the previous traverse.  In this regard the observed increase in Tuliptree along the traverse is also pertinent.</P></ul><B><P >Mountain Spur Ascent and Plant/Substrate Correlation<br></B><B>Source Walk: 9-15-96 with brief 6-23-96 and 4-13-97 observations    <ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </P></B><P>The spur referred to here and in the foregoing traverses rises toward the southeast from immediately north of the campground, curves southward and after a half mile (800 meters) terminates on the main mountain ridge.  Elevations range from a little over 1700 feet to 2530 (520 to 770 meters) asl along the crest.  The traverse was executed with the objective of correlating plant spatial occurrences with substrate type including rock exposures and soil depth to rock in particular. To facilitate presentation the traverse is divided into sections with either relatively uniform or heterogenous characteristics but of convenient lengths.</P><P>The first section of the traverse, which extends over about a quarter of the total, appears to be over dominantly limestone terrain with fairly frequent outcroppings of this general rock type.  However the first 200 ft (60 meter) or so is dominated by sandstone. Although the spur crest, along which the traverse extends, is narrow, and the soils shallow, the vegetation is still quite mesic in character.  The first section of canopy is comprised of White, Black and Chinquapin Oaks, Shagbark and Pignut Hickories, Sugar Maple, White Pine and Cucumbertree but there is some Beech associated with the sandstone at the base.  A single Scarlet Oak was located uncharacteristically near a limestone outcrop near the top of the section.  The understory along the section consists of Flowering Dogwood, Hophornbeam and Muscletree with Witch Hazel a common shrub.  Rock surfaces, and particularly sandstone, generally contained a vigorous growth of Cliff Stonecrop (<I>Sedum glaucophyllum</I>) with abundant Hog Peanut in the vicinity.  Other common herbs were Trout Lily, Squaw Weed, Wreath Goldenrod, Late Purple Aster (in bloom in July), the Tick-trefoil<I> Desmodium glutinosum</I>, Hispid Buttercup (<I>Ranunculus hispidus</I>), Roundlobe Hepatica, <I>Brachyelytrum</I>  grass, Pale Indian Plantain, Wood Betony, Blue Monkshood (<I>Aconitum uncinatum</I>) a Meadowrue (<I>Thalictrum  </I>sp.) and the sedge <I>Carex platyphylla</I>.  Associated with the sandstone were Early Saxifrage (<I>Saxifraga virginiensis</I>), Creeping Phlox, Short-leaved Bluegrass (<I>Poa  cuspidata</I>) and <I>Dicranum</I> moss on sandstone.  Elevation at the end of the section was perhaps 2000 ft (610 meters).</P><P>In the second section of the traverse, which was of similar length to the first, there is an abrupt change to a substrate with few rock exposures and presumed deeper soils.  Rocks which are exposed appear to be siliceous and, in the absence of detailed examination, could be either chert or sandstone.  The canopy is dominated by large White Pine and smaller Beech, but also contains Tuliptree, Black and White Oaks, Red Maple and at least one large Sassafras.  Sugar Maple and Northern Red Oak may also occur, although these were not specifically noted  One small Hemlock was seen at the top of the section.  As in the previous section,  Flowering Dogwood is conspicuous in the understory and Witch Hazel in the shrub layer.  The herb layer was ushered in at the start by abundant Wild Sarsaparilla, a little Teaberry (<I>Gaultheria  procumbens</I>) and large patches of moss, including <I>Leucobryum</I>, as well as <I>Cladonia</I>  and <I>Cladina</I>  lichens.  Standing out against this forest floor were a few plants of red Pinesap (<I>Monotropa hypopithes</I>).  This generally acid character of the vegetation was maintained and further emphasized approaching the top of the section, where Upland Low Blueberry (<I>Vaccinium</I>  <I>pallidum</I>), Deer berry (<I>V.  stamineum</I>), Downy Rattlesnake Plantain and Spotted Wintergreen occur.  Also present here, at an elevation of perhaps 2200 ft (670 meter) asl, was Silverrod (<I>Solidago  bicolor</I>).</P><P>Other species noted in this same general area on 6-23-96 were Rattlesnake Weed (<I>Hieracium venosum</I>), Yellow Stargrass (<I>Hypoxis  hirsuta</I>), Spiked Lobelia (<I>Lobelia spicata</I>), Downy Yellow Foxglove (<I>Aureolaria  virginica</I>), Entire-leaved Yellow Foxglove (<I>A.   l&aelig;vigata</I>), the Panic grass <I>Panicum commutatum</I>  and the Wood Rush <I>Luzula echinata</I>.</P><P>The following section of the traverse, shorter than the previous ones, began with a steep rise, followed by a limestone exposure which bore Walking Fern, and in close proximity, abundant Hog Peanut.  These were succeeded by large White Pine and Northern Red Oak, then a little Spotted Wintergreen in an unusual occurrence near a limestone outcrop.  Christmas Fern was generally quite abundant here also.  Near the top of the section the soil appeared to be deeper with little or no rock exposure and Beech and Wild Sarsaparilla again made an appearance.</P><P>The next section was also a short one, beginning with a limestone outcrop bearing Plantain-leaf Pussytoes (<I>Antennaria plantaginifolia</I>) and, as usual, associated Hog Peanut.  These were followed by a Chestnut Oak, uncharacteristically close to what appeared to be limestone;  then, a little higher up, by Red Maple, White Pine, Tuliptree, and Roundlobe Hepatica, and finally by more exposed limestone and nearby Shagbark Hickory and Muscletree.</P><P>After this, a massive outcrop of chert or quartzite initiated a section with a canopy consisting of Chestnut Oak, Tuliptree,  Sugar Maple, Shagbark Hickory, Cucumbertree and Black Locust, with a Flowering Dogwood understory and Bottlebrush Grass.  Following this the slope levelled off with more Chestnut and other Oaks, Tuliptree and some trees with large fire scars.  The section ended below another steepening of the slope in a seepy opening with a large patch of Wingstem and <I>Brachyelytrum </I>grass.</P><P>The section above the steep slope was initially characterized by more <I>Brachyelytrum</I>  grass, a large Pignut Hickory, Red Maple and Roundlobe Hepatica.  A little beyond, limestone outcropping with Chinquapin Oak, Muscletree and abundant Hog peanut was followed by another steepening of the slope and a larger exposure of the same rock.  Following this was an outcropping of either chert or quartzite with associated Chestnut and Northern Red Oaks, Red Maple, Pignut Hickory, Pitch Pine, Flowering Dogwood, Deer Berry, Autumn Bent Grass and, near the top, Black Cohosh.</P><P>In the last section, the traverse attained its highest point, a slight eminence on the main mountain ridge at an elevation of 2530 ft (770 meter) asl.  The rock exposed here appears to be sandstone and the associated forest canopy is Black, Chestnut and Scarlet Oaks, Black Locust, Red Maple, White Ash, Sassafras, Dogwood, with Black Cohosh abundant in the herb layer.  Also present in the area are large down tree boles, some of which may be American Chestnut.</P><P>It is obvious that the spur-crest along which the traverse extended is very heterogenous with respect to rock type and vegetation.  While outcrops appear to consist of either limestone or siliceous rock (e.g. sandstone, quartzite or chert) it is possible that other rock types such as shale also occur but are covered by overburden.  As in other areas there appears to be close correspondence between acid-soil species such as Beech, Red Maple and <I>ericaceae</I>,<I> </I> with deep soil areas and siliceous rock exposures, while Chinquapin Oak and Hog Peanut are associated with limestone.  However the close association here of Roundlobe Hepatica and the latter rock indicates that this plant, which is usually found in acid-soil environments, also has a more alkaline stability field.  Similarly the association of Hog peanut with limestone on the traverse is a matter of degree since, while less prolific there, it is also found in more acid-soil areas.</P></ul><B><P>Spur Addendum for April, May, June and July</P></B><ul><P>In these and subsequent visits it became apparent that the thin-bedded sandstone of the lower spur was calcareous, with calcium carbonate cementing silica sand grains. However, most, or perhaps all of the exposure of this sandstone, and likely extentions of it at depth, had become armored by a secondary mineral, possibly a silicate, that acts to sequester the calcium carbonate in the rock interior. Consequently a surface acid reaction became possible and certain acidiphiles such as Spotted Wintergreen, Early Saxifrage and beech could establish themselves.</P><P>Some species noted on the lower spur on 4-13-97 were Creeping Phlox, Early Saxifrage, Great Chickweed, Plantain-leaf Pussytoes, Roundlobe Hepatica, Short-leaved Bluegrass (<I>Poa cuspidata </I>), Trout Lily, Wild Geranium, <I>Carex pensylvanica, C. platyphylla,</I> Bloodroot, Wood Betony, <I>Senecio smallii</I>  and <I>C. aureus</I>.. All of these, except Trout Lily,(which was forming seeds), were in bloom. A species of the acidiphile moss <I>Dicranum  </I>occurred on rock surfaces.</P><P>Illustrating the close juxtaposition of acidic and alkaline microhabitats is the occurrence on the lower spur of a moderately large Beech with Spotted Wintergreen at its base, presumably on carbonate-sequestered sandstone. However, less than ten meters upslope stands a lone Chinquapin Oak, likely in contact with calcareous material in the root zone.</P><P>Making our way up the lower spur on 7-8-97 we encountered a medium sized, dark colored American Toad concealed between sandstone layers. Farther up, after noting Nodding Onion and Wild Sarsaparilla at the top of the sandstone section, an inventory was done in the vicinity of the first outcrop of limestone. The canopy here consists of large Northern Red and White Oaks, Chinquapin Oak, Black Walnut, Slippery Elm, White Pine, Sugar and Black Maples and a small Cucumbertree. Redbud, Muscletree, Flowering Dogwood, Alternate-leaf Dogwood, Blackhaw Viburnum formed understory and shrub layers, while vines were represented by Common Greenbrier and Virginia Creeper. Herbs noted were Cliff Stonecrop (<I>Sedum  glaucophyllum</I>), here directly on limestone, Pale Indian Plantain, The panic grasses <I>Panicum boscii</I>  and <I>P. latifolia</I>, the alien Canada Bluegrass (<I> Poa  compressa </I>), the tick trefoil <I>Desmodium glutinosum</I>, very abundant Hog Peanut, Canada Brome grass, White Snakeroot, Wood Betony, uncharacteristically near limestone, Nodding Fescue, Bottlebrush Grass, abundant Squaw Weed, Black Cohosh, Four-leaved Yam, a Meadowrue (<I> Thalictrum</I> sp), a Vetch (<I>Vicia</I>  sp), Nodding Onion, Golden Alexanders (<I>Zizia  aptera</I>), Plume Lily, Blue Monkshood (budding), Roundlobe Hepatica,(also near limestone) and Plantain-leaved Pussytoes.</P><P>Downslope a few meters toward O'Roarke Draft, on a northerly aspect, there were large Northern Red Oak, Sugar and Black Maple, Mealy Bellwort, Squawroot, Hairy Disporum, Carex platyphylla, Roundlobe Hepatica, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Squawweed, Wild Ginger, Brachyelytrum grass and White Snakeroot. These herbs formed a sparse ground cover, perhaps as a result of he deep shade.</P><P>Additional species recorded in October from the xeric, acidic main ridge crest above 2400 feet (730 m) were Recurved Fetterbush (<I>Leucothoe</I>  <I>recurva</I>), Stiff Aster (<I> Aster  linariifolius </I>), Wild Lupine (<I>Lupinus  perennans </I>), American Pennyroyal (<I>Hedeoma  pulegioides </I>), Bracken Fern (<I>Pteridium  aquilinum </I>) and False Pennyroyal (<I>Isanthus  brachiatus </I>).</P></ul><B><P >ORoarke Draft<br></B><B>Source Walks: 6-23-96 and 7-7-96</P><ul></B><P>The 6-23-96 traverse extended perhaps a half mile (0.3 km) upstream along the essentially north-facing slope above the Draft.  This slope is fairly steep with numerous large rock falls and deep, almost black (when moist) colluvial soil.  The area, on average, appears to be somewhat more acidic than the most calcareous terrain encountered thus far.  However, many of the large blocks appear to be limestone, frequently with a superficial white crust that may be secondary carbonate-derived by capillary action from the rock interior.  However it may also be lichen.  Tuliptree dominates the canopy, with Northern Red Oak and fairly abundant, healthy-appearing Hemlock.  Black Oak is also common, as is Black Birch and Beech (some large).  Other canopy species are White Oak, Pignut, Bitternut and Shagbark Hickories and Sugar Maple, but very little Black Maple.  There is also scattered Red Maple, presumably in the most acidic enclaves, and a few large White Pine.  The understory and shrub layers are dominated by Muscletree, Flowering Dogwood, Spice Bush and Witch Hazel.  One small clump of American Chestnut sprouts was seen.</P><P>Most of the slope, except under Hemlock, is covered by very luxuriant and diverse communities of herbs.  Patches of Tall Wingstem occur in openings.  In shady areas the most common species are Black Cohosh, Blue Cohosh, Wild Ginger, Horse Balm, Wood Nettle, Virginia Knotweed and Christmas and Maidenhair Ferns.  In places there are patches of Bulbiferous Bladder Fern, perhaps indicating more than usually limy areas, or Wild Stonecrop.  Both Miterwort (<I>Mitella cordifolia</I>) and Foam Flower occur as do Woodland Strawberry (<I>Fragaria vesca</I>) and Striped Violet.  Less familiar and even rare species that thrive on this slope are  the calciphile sedge <I>Carex albursina</I>, Showy Orchid (<I>Orchis  spectabilis</I>), Goldie's Fern (<I>Dryopteris  goldiana</I>) and Great Indian Plantain (<I>Cacalia</I>  <I>muehlenbergii</I>).  Other ferns seen were Glade Fern (<I>Athyrium pycnocarpon</I>), Intermediate Shield Fern and Ebony Spleenwort (<I>Asplenium platyneuron</I>), while some large blocks of rock, including those of sandstone, harbor Walking Fern.  In presumably more acid soil, usually associated with Hemlock, <I>Medeola</I> is common.  Other species in our tally included Wild Liquorice, Purple Bedstraw, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Virginia Waterleaf, Indian Turnip, Large-flowered Trillium, White Wood Aster and Roundlobe Hepatica, but no Sharplobe was seen.  It should also be mentioned that, while not observed on this traverse, Twin-leaf (<I>Jeffersonia diphylla</I>) had been seen in the vicinity on a previous visit.  Also, in a side branch of the stream we observed a lush growth of Lettuce Saxifrage (<I>Saxifraga micranthidifolia</I>) and nearby, attractive patches of Tree Moss (<I>Climacium</I>) and on rocks, Rose Moss (<I>Rhodobryum roseum</I>).</P><P>In moister areas, particularly near the stream and road, a number of aliens, including Garlic Mustard (<I>Alliaria  officianalis</I>) and Ground Ivy (<I>Glechoma  hederacea</I>) took advantage of the fertility and mingled with the natives.</P><P>Of particular interest and attractiveness on this day was the variety of fungi, some with unfamiliar and astonishing forms, the structures of which are difficult to fathom.  Among the most colorful, complex and arresting was the small (3 cm) Shaggy Scarlet Cup (<I>Microstoma  floccosa</I>) which grew on a rotting stick of deciduous wood;  but many others also vied for our attention (see listing).</P><P>The 7-7-96 traverse again extended along ORoarke Draft for a distance comparable to the first, but more in the vicinity of the stream itself.  Near the campground we noted that the stream flow, if any, appeared to be concealed by the bed load, although it again became visible upstream.</P><P>Not far above the campground Intermediate Shield Fern grew on the stream bank, and a little farther up, Bulbiferous Bladder Fern and Rattlesnake Fern (<I>Botrychium  virginianum</I>).  These were shortly followed by our most significant discovery, namely a single plant of Grays Lily (<I>Lilium</I>  <I>grayi</I>) in full bloom in quite dense forest high on the south-facing bank above the stream.  Of interest is the contrast of this habitat with the occurrence of this species in an open, high elevation meadow on Whitetop Mountain.</P><P>Our traverse then reached a high bench or terrace north of the stream, which is populated by Hemlock, White Pine, Sugar Maple, Beech, Northern Red and White Oaks, Shagbark Hickory, Flowering Dogwood, Witch Hazel and a ground flora of Christmas Fern, Rattlesnake Plantain and Four-leaved Yam.  A little Upland Low Blueberry and Mountain Laurel clearly indicated acid conditions.  It may be that this acidity is a consequence in part of deep soil as implied by the lack of rock outcroppings and which both indicates and favors the deep leaching seemingly required by such species as Beech.</P><P>Continuing up the Draft we observed Slender-flowered Muhly (<I>Muhlenbergia tenuiflora</I>), Intermediate Shield Fern and much Beech.  In the vicinity of the stream once more we saw Wild Stonecrop, large plants of Skunk Cabbage (<I>Symplocarpus foetidis</I>), tall culms of <I>Carex crinita</I>  and Turtlehead (<I>Chelone glabra</I>);  then, on the bank itself, Goldie's, Intermediate Shield, Christmas and Maidenhair Ferns as well as the first Cinnamon Fern (<I>Osmunda  cinnamomea</I>).  These were promptly followed by Silvery Glade Fern, Virginia Waterleaf and a large Hemlock with exposed roots on the cut bank firmly clasping what appeared to be a large boss of limestone.  Still farther upstream we noted Wahoo, Blue Cohosh, the sedge <I>Carex gracillima</I>, <I>Medeola  </I>and, revealingly side by side, two species of Spinulose Shield Fern, the evergreen <I>Dryopteris intermedia</I> and the deciduous <I>D. carthusiana</I>.  Not far beyond, on elevated ground, and less 150 feet (46 meters) from the road, we saw an unusual alien, the European Orchid <I>Epipactus helleborine</I>, almost in bloom.  Nearby we identified the grass Nimblewill <I>Muhlenbergia  schreberi </I>) and continuing up the Draft, quite suddenly entering an area in which New York Fern became overwhelming abundant.  Beyond this, under White Pine and Shagbark Hickory, with Partridge Berry and Mealy Bellwort, in quite deep shade, we came upon an isolated clump of fruiting Millet Grass in an environment rather different from that in which it grew on the campground terrace.</P><P>We then entered low ground again, in an area with limestone exposures, a number of which were large detached rockfall blocks.  Growing on one of these were Tree Moss (<I>Climacium</I>), Fowl Manna Grass, Wild Ginger, Intermediate Shield Fern, Lowland Brittle Fern (<I>Cystopteris protrusa</I>), Maidenhair Fern, Great Chickweed and Miterwort.  In a nearby herb-rich depression we recorded Broad Beech Fern (<I>Phegopteris  hexagonoptera</I>), many plants of Showy Orchids, Carrion Flower in two varieties (<I>Smilax  herbacea  </I>var.<I> herbacea</I>  and var<I>. pulverulenta</I>),<I> Carex gynandra</I>, <I>Carex l&aelig;vivaginata</I>  and a small Butternut (<I>Juglans cinera</I>).  A great variety of mosses covered a high north-facing streambank.  These included<I> Climacium americanum</I>, Apple Moss (<I>Bartramia pomiformis</I>), species of <I>Thuidium</I>, <I>Fissidens</I>, <I>Atrichum</I> and others.  Here also, attesting to near circumneutral water, the stream itself contained a bit of watercress (<I>Nasturtium officinale</I>) albeit restrained by deep shade.</P><P>No fish or other stream life was seen, although this failure was no doubt a result of our time limits and consequent lack of attention.  However as we turned back along the narrow floodplain we were cheered by a large colorful moth with conspicuous white slashes on its wings.  With great difficulty it untangled itself from the low vegetation and flew off, presumably on its maiden flight, having on this late afternoon emerged from its chrysalis.  We then ended the traverse by taking the road back with final identifications of Black Walnut and Dotted Thorn (<I>Crat&aelig;gus  punctata</I>) along its edge.</P><B></ul><P >Return to Blowing Springs<br>Terrace and River Trail<br>Source Walk: 4-28-98</P><ul><P></B>On this quite warm and sunny day an Osprey (<I>Pandion haliatus </I>) circled above Back Creek at the terrace campground, while earlier, on a stop at Panther Gap along Route 39, I had seen my first Scarlet Tanager of the year. Also, at the terrace, many warblers, among which we identified the Parula (<I>Parula  americana</I>), darted through the canopy.</P><P>On a walk along the river trail we saw the edible - and quite tasty - Dryad Saddle polypore (<I>Polyporus  squamosus </I>) as well as our first <I>Erythronium  americanum</I>  in the area, and which is far less common than <I>E</I>. <I>umbilicatum</I>  here. American Toads called along the shore, Smooth Yellow Violet (<I>Viola  pensylvanica</I>) bloomed abundantly and numerous butterflies gathered at selected locations along the trail. Among these were Eastern Tailed Blue (<I>Everes  comyntas </I>), Juvenal's Dusky Wing (<I> Erynnis  juvenalis</I>). Columbine Dusky Wing (<I>E.  lucilius </I>), Mourning Cloak (<I>Nymphalis  antiopa </I>), Tiger Swallowtail (<I>Papilio  glaucus</I>), Cabbage Butterfly (<I> Pieris rapae </I>), Spring Azure (<I>Cetastrina  argiolus</I>), Silver-spotted Skipper (<I>Epargyreus clarus</I>), Black Swallowtail (<I> Papilio  polyxenes </I>) and Falcate Orange Tip (<I>Anthcaris  genutia</I>). Columbine too was in bloom on limestone outcrops and <I>Carex  gracillima</I>  was noted for the first time.</P><P>At the campground we identified the aliens Ivy- leaved Speedwell (<I>Veronica  hederaefolia</I>), Thyme - leaved Speedwell (<I>V. serpyllifolia </I>) and Great Mullein (<I>Verbascum thapsus</I>).</P></ul><B><P >Ascent of Back Creek Mountain<br>Source Walk: 4-29-98</P><ul><P></B>On this cloudy morning we ascended the soutwest face of Back Creek Mountain, beginning just west of the campground along Route 39 and near the large springs that occur there. Our initial route lay along a gated logging road.</P><P>While still on the Back Creek flood plain our attention was attracted by many birds in the tree tops and in shrubery close to the stream. Included were Parula Warbler, Blue - gray Gnatcatcher (<I>Polioptila melanura </I>), flocks of Goldfinch (<I>Spinus tristis</I>), Cardinal (<I>Richmondena cardinalis </I>) and the calls of Ovenbirds and Red - eyed Vireos.</P><P>Not far above the road we came to a strong spring that emerges from a large cave opening in a limestone cliff. Although the forest was in a degraded state here, it had evidently once been of a rich mesic type as indicated by the canopy. This consisted of Black Walnut, Slippery Elm, Basswood, Black Maple and Shagbark Hickory in close association with the limestone and with Beech near an outcrop of sandstone, thus displaying the charateristic chemical preferences of these species. Other species in the general area were Blach Haw Viburnum, Spice Bush, Bulbiferous Bladder Fern, <I>Carex blanda</I>, <I>C. hirtifolia</I>, <I>Brachyelytrum</I>  grass and the aliens <I>Galium parisiense  </I>and Garlic Mustard. Of considerable interest was the sign of Beaver in the form of cuttings and a well- worn trail leading to a den opening in the steep bank several meters above the emerging spring. In a related matter, it has recently been discovered that the "pristine" waters of these springs are frequently contaminated by bats that inhabit the caves from which the springs issue (personal communication from D. Simpkins).</P><P>As we continued our climb, now diverging from the road, we encountered cosiderable sandstone, which showed no sign of calcareous cement, as many sandstones of the area do. White Oak dominated the canopy in association with Black Oak, Pignut Hickory of undetermined species, Round-leaf Hepatica, Creeping Five-leaf, Haircap moss (<I> Polytrichum</I>  sp), Wild Vetch (<I>Vicia  caroliniana</I>), Short-leaved Bluegrass, <I>Carex  communis</I>  and Interrupted Fern. Up-slope, White Oak continued abundant, but with Tuliptree in an area of more exposed sandstone. Here also were the Devil's Urn fungus (<I>Urnula craterium </I>), Spring Bluets in bloom, Single - headed Pussytoes (<I>Antennaria  solitaria</I>), Wheat Moss (<I>Diphyscium  foliosum </I>) and species of <I>Dicranum</I>, <I>Atrichum</I>  and <I>Leucobryum</I>. Next noted was Dwarf Iris (<I>Iris  verna </I>) in full bloom, Trailing Arbutus, Upland Low Blueberry and Corymed Spiraea (<I>Spiraea corymbosa</I>  or <I>S. betulafolia</I>). Dwarf Iris continued to appear in frequent patches as we continued upward.</P><P>We now entered an area of dominantly White Oak canopy but with considerable White Pine, both large and small. Also noted were Downy Serviceberry, Upland Low Blueberry, the first Black Huckleberry (<I>Gaylussacia  baccata</I>), more <I>Corymed Spiraea</I>, Hay-scented Fern, <I>Potentilla</I>  <I>canadensis </I>(0n basis of flower position), Wild Indigo (<I> Baptisia  tinctoria</I>), Hairy Bedstraw (<I>Galium  pilosum</I>), a little Maple-leaf Viburnum and the call of a Piliated Woodpecker. These were followed up-slope by abundant White Pine, Scarlet Oak, Red Maple, Teaberry, Black Huckleberry, the first-noted Spotted Wintergreen and, in large White Pine,two stick nests in high crotches near the trunks and about 20 inches (50 cm) in diameter. Here also were Black Gum in the form of large saplings and Downy Rattlesnake Plantain.</P><P>We next entered a clearing that was part of a large clearcut and in which we saw the alien Piedmont Bedstraw (<I>Galium pedemontanum </I>) and heard from the bordering forest the call of an Ovenbird.</P><P>The logging road we had again been following now lay along the northwest-facing slope that overlooks the Back Creek Valley. Still within the large clearcut, we came upon Columbine blooming on an outcrop of limestone. Here it was apparent that a rich mesic forest had been cut when the trees - in this case mostly Tuliptree - had been less than a foot in the diameter and hence young enough to sprout prolifically. Thus a potentially valuable stand of timber had been sacrificed for practically valueless pulpwood - and at taxpayer's expense - an all too frequent occurrence under the management of the U S Forest Service. Other species noted here were Staghorn Sumac, Wingstem and, in a seep, Skunk Cabbage. The few birds seen  included Chickadees of unretermined species and Tufted Titmice. Whereas the limestone seen first was a massive blue-gray rock, this passed upward into a limy shale (by an acid test) and this in turn higher up into thin-bedded siltstone and sandstone in shale.</P><P>It is likely that we could have identified a number of other mesic species associated with these carbonate rocks had we had the time. However our traverse was terminated where the logging road made a sharp turn to the right at near 2100 feet (641 m) asl at the foot of a steep slope. A worthwhile result of this traverse was the verification once more of the possibility of establishment of rich mesic forest types on exposed ridges where carbonate is the underlying rock.  </P></ul><B><P >Summary</P></B><ul><P>The study reported here shows the Blowing Springs Area to be a center of both biologic and geologic diversity.  Habitats represented are riverine shore, flood plain, terrace, slopes of various aspects and steepness, acid and alkaline colluvium, talus, rockfall and outcrop.  The flora here is essentially Southern Appalachian with only seven markedly northern species.  These are Arborvit&aelig;, Mountain and Striped Maple (both rare), Millet Grass, Wild Sarsaparilla, Mountain Oat Grass and a single known occurrence of Canada Mayflower.  Although the relations are complex, there are many positive, if subtle, correlations between rock and soil chemistry and moisture and individual species of vascular plants.  Associations and/or mutual exclusiveness among such taxa as Oaks, Hepatica, Hog Peanut and Canada Mayflower, to name a few, pose intriguing problems of interpretation.  The occurrence of some species such as Beech appear to be related to depth of soil cover.  Such relations;  as well as the accessibility of the area make it an ideal living classroom to teach forest ecology .  More importantly they qualify the area as an ecological hotspot in the service of the regional landscape mosaic with a potential for designation as a wildland reserve.</P></ul><B><P >References</P><ul></B><P>Crum, Howard and Lewis E.

This behavior parallels that of certain vascular plants such as Millet Grass.Although many of the mosses are of calciphile affinities, conditions of the substrate here are so complex that it is difficult to sort out such affinities. For example,in addition to limestone, calcareous sandstones are common, and many of these are degraded, with consequent partial loss of carbonate, while some have apparently developed crusts of secondary minerals that armor them and prevent access to the carbonate in the interior. Thus acidiphile species may exist in close proximity to calciphiles. An example is the "rotten sandstone" of sample number 12.</P><B><P>&nbsp;</P><P >Fungi of Blowing Springs Collected and Identified by R.
