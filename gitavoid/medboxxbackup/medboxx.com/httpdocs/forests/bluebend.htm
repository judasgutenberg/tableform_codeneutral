<h1>Blue Bend/Round Mountain</h1>
<ul>

<p><b>Greenbrier County,
West Virginia</b><br>
<b>August, 2001</b>
 
<h2>Geologic Setting</h2>
<ul>
<p> 
<p>Blue
Bend marks a sharp bend of Anthony Creek, a major stream in this part of the
Valley and Ridge physiographic province. Bedrock underlying the area is Chemung
Group, consisting of gray to brown siltstone, sandstone and shale with
conglomeratic interbeds. Not far upstream Anthony Creek cuts through Braillier
Formation, which consists of siltstone and shale, and the Millboro Shale.
Still farther up, the Creek cuts the Ridgeley Sandstone, in which silica sand
grains are cemented by calcium carbonate (Cardwell <i>et al</i>, 1968) . All
these rocks are of Devonian or Upper Silurian age. Additionally, both the
Braillier Formation and the Millboro Shale may contain minor carbonate beds or
concretions. Thus, while the overall impression of rock in the area is one of dominantly
siliceous and acidic character, the calcareous component may be expected to
assert itself locally.

<p>Our
1993 visit was in the nature of a reconnaissance and was largely confined to
the vicinity of Anthony Creek and its flood plain. At that time it was noted
that the flood plain canopy was dominated by mature Sugar and Red Maples, Yellow Buckeye (<i>Aesculus octandra</i>), Beech, Tuliptree, Canada
Hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>), 
White Pine, Shagbark Hickory (practically the only hickory seen), American
and White Basswoods (<i>Tilia 
americana </i>and <i>T. 
heterophylla</i>), Black Locust, Black Cherry, Black Gum, Northern Red
Oak and Slippery Elm (<i>Ulmus rubra</i>
), while Muscletree (<i>Carpinus caroliniana</i>
), flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus 
florida</i>) and hawthorn (<i>Crataegus </i> sp) constituted an understory. Great Rhododendron (<i>
Rhododendron maximum</i>) and Spice
Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>) 
appeared to be the most common shrubs, but Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i>) and blackberries (<i>Rubus
</i> spp) were also noted. Conspicuous
vines were Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus 
radicans</i>), Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinqefolia</i>) and Japanese Honeysuckle (
<i>Lonicera japonica</i>) . Other
species seen close to the stream were Sycamore, Silky Dogwood (<i>Cornus amomum</i>), Ninebark (<i>Physocarpus opulifolius</i>), Cardinal Flower (<i>
Lobelia cardinalis</i>) and Great Blue
Lobelia (<i>L</i>. <i>siphilitica</i>
), with the last two both in bloom. On the flood plain quite generally, the
most conspicuous, if not the most abundant herbs appeared to be White Wood
Aster (<i>Aster divaricatus</i>
), Common Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium 
fistulosum</i>), Horse Balm (<i>Collinsonia canadensis</i>), Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>), Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i>), Wingstem (<i>Verbesina alternifolia</i>), Lopseed (<i>Phryma leptostachya</i>), Wild Stonecrop (<i>Sedum ternatum</i>), Canada Moonseed ( <i>Menispermum canadense</i>), Clearweed (<i>Pilea pumila</i>), Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza </i> sp), Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio aureus</i>) and Squawweed (<i>Senecio obovatus</i>) . The prominence of some of
the more nutrient-demanding of these species exceeds that noted in our Year
2000 flood plain inventory and probably reflects the different areas
represented by these two inventories.
<p> On 9-3-93 a
traverse was made along the left side of Anthony Creek, downstream from the
foot bridge. The forest here, on a narrow segment of the flood plain and the
lower slope of Round Mountain, was observed to be a very rich mesophytic type
dominated by Tuliptree, Yellow Buckeye, with a heavy crop of nuts, Sugar Maple,
White Ash, Beech, Shagbark Hickory, American and White Basswoods, Black Birch,
Northern Red Oak, Hemlock and White pine, some of large size, but probably not
old growth. Northern Red Oak appeared to be virtually the only oak, although
White Oak was observed on nearby lower slopes. Black Cherry, Cucumbertree (<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>), Black Locust, Slippery Elm and Red Maple
appeared to be minor constituents and Sycamore was concentrated near the Creek.
Hemlock appeared to be Adelgid-free. The most common understory tree appeared
to be Muscletree, with less common Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya virginiana</i>), Redbud (<i>Cercis canadensis</i>), Flowering and
Alternate-leaved (<i>Cornus 
alternifolia</i>) Dogwoods and minor small Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>) . Spice Bush appeared to
be the most common shrub and Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>) occurred in moist openings.
<p> Partridge
Berry was observed to be uncommon in its usual habitat under Hemlock, but in
certain areas formed dense colonies on banks and at scattered locations. Wild
Stonecrop appeared to be the most pervasive ground cover in moist shady areas
and, while not common, Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila maculata</i>) and Downy Rattlesnake
Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>) 
were seen in a few places.
<p> Progressing
along the Creek, the horizontal and relatively thin bedded rocks and generally
moisture and nutrient-rich regime were noted. A &quot;riot&quot; of luxuriant
vegetation here included Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea arborescens</i>), Wingstem, Broad-leaf
Goldenrod ( <i>Solidago flexicaulis</i>), American Spikenard ( <i>Aralia 
racemosa</i>), Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum lanuginosum</i>) with ripe fruit, Bladdernut (<i>Staphylea trifolia</i>), Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>), New York Fern (<i>
Thelypteris noveboracensis</i>), 
Sensitive Fern (<i>Onaclea sensibilis</i>
), Intermediate and Marginal Shield Ferns (D<i>ryopteris intermedia</i> and <i>D. marginalis</i>), Indian Turnip (<i>
Arisaema triphyllum</i>), Wood
Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>), 
Horse Balm and Lopseed. Large Hairy Heuchera (<i>Heuchera villosa</i>) festooned rock and in places
Mountain Maple (<i>Acer spicatum</i>) 
and larger than normal Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>) indicated the cool microclimate of the moist
northern aspect. Of particular interest was the presence of Sharplobe Hepatica
(<i>Hepatica acutiloba</i>) and
Walking Fern (<i>Camptosorus rhyzophyllus</i>
), the latter on damp rock surfaces, since these plants are strong calciphiles.
Their mention here is also significant as neither was observed on our Year 2000
visit, perhaps due to a shortened traverse imposed by trail obliteration on the
dangerously steep slope. It is curious also that the conspicuous presence of
Great Rhododendron on this slope was not recorded in 1993.
<p> Our first
Year 2000 inventory, during early afternoon of 9-4-00, consisted of a short
traverse across the sloping flood plain/terrace on the northwest side of
Anthony Creek. The area is within the Monongahela National Forest campground.
Cool and cloudy conditions prevailed.
<p> Alluvium on
the flood plain consists of a mixture of boulders and cobble, largely
sandstone, smaller clasts of sandstone, siltstone and shale and finer
interstitial material. No carbonate was observed and the regime is acid/mesic in
character. In some areas, apparently mostly at higher elevations of the flood
plain, the ground flora was dominated by such acidiphiles as Partridge Berry.
However for the most part areas nearer the Creek were occupied by a quite rich
mesic flora with scattered calciphiles.
<p> The canopy
appeared to be dominated by mesic species, in general agreement with our 1993
assessment. Trees appeared generally vigorous and well-formed. Particularly
imposing were the large White Pine and Hemlock. Accompanying these were
abundant Sugar Maple, both large and small, Tuliptree, Yellow Buckeye, Northern
Red, Black and White Oaks, Basswoods with characteristics ranging from American
to White, Shagbark, pignut and Bitternut Hickories, with Shagbark the most
common by far, Black Birch, Black Gum, White Ash, Beech, Red Maple, Red
Mulberry (<i>Morus rubra</i>) and,
concentrated near the Creek, Sycamore. Only one small Chestnut Oak (<i>
Quercus prinus</i>) was seen, a
possible consequence of the antipathy of this species to high water tables.
Small and understory trees observed were Muscletree, Hophornbeam and Flowering
Dogwood. While Great Rhododendron dominated among shrubs, Witch Hazel, Spice
Bush, Shrubby St Johns Wort (<i>Hypericum sphatulatum</i>) and a little Mountain
Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>) were
also present. One small Bladdernut (see later) was seen. Large, vigorous
vines of Summer Grape (<i>Vitis 
aestivalis</i>) occurred in several places.
<p> A traverse
made up-valley yielded the following in succession : Horse Balm, Virginia
Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus 
quinquefolia</i>), Clustered Snakeroot (<i>Sanicula</i> <i>gregaria</i>), Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii</i>), Smooth Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza
 longistylis</i>), Hophornbeam,
the call of a Belted Kingfisher (<i>Ceryle 
alcyon</i>), the Polemonium<i>P. reptans</i>, Black Cohosh, Wild
Geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>), 
abundant Wild Stonecrop, Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola blanda</i>), Mountain Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia compressa</i>), common Roundlobe Hepatica (
<i>Hepatica americana</i>), blooming
White Wood Aster, Canada Bromegrass (<i>Bromus pubescens</i>), widespread Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata</i>), Shining Bedstraw (<i>Galium concinnum</i>), Black Oak, Golden Ragwort,
Squawweed, the alien Ground Ivy (<i>Glechoma 
hederacea</i>), blooming Calico Aster (<i>Aster lateriflorus</i>), the sedge <i>Carex laxiflora,</i> Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium virginianum</i>), European Selfheal (<i>Prunella vulgaris </i> var <i>vulgaris</i>), 
Bottlebrush Grass (<i>Elymus hystrix</i>
), White Grass (<i>Leersia virginica</i>
), common but stunted Indian Turnip, the sedge <i>Carex plantaginea</i>, usually an indicator of
good soils, Small Yellow Crownbeard (<i>Verbesina occidentalis</i>), Shrubby St Johns Wort, a patch of Crested
Dwarf Iris (<i>Iris</i> <i>cristata</i>,
Cardinal Flower and Great Blue Lobelia, both in bloom, Christmas Fern, Plume
Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>), 
scattered Wingstem, an unidentified <i>Atrichum</i> moss, Partridge Berry and
New York Fern.
<p> At this
point we noted the first occurrence of large (extended length 5 – 6 inches /
13 – 15 cm) gray earthworms wriggling rapidly across the forest floor after
being flushed by our footfalls. We now had reached an elevated (by ~ 1 m) 
area under a grove of Hemlock with mostly bare needle duff beneath, but with
scattered Common Speedwell (<i>Veronica 
officinalis</i>) Poison Ivy, Spotted Wintergreen, Roundleaf Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia</i>), Downy Rattlesnake
Plantain, Miterwort (<i>Mitella 
diphylla</i>), Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia quadrifolia</i>), Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>) and the acidiphile tick
trefoil <i>Desmodium nudiflorum</i>.
<p> Continuing
up-valley, we saw seedlings of White Ash, the pignut hickory <i>Carya glabra</i>, Shagbark Hickory, Spice Bush,
Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i>
) and American Dog Violet (<i>Viola 
conspersa</i>), which, according to Strausbaugh and Core (1977), is
found in &quot;cool shady places in the mountains.&quot; Next recorded were
Hispid Greenbrier (<i>Smilax hispida</i>
), also usually an indicator of rich soils, seedlings of Northern Red Oak and
Heart-leaf Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria 
ovata</i>), which, again according to S and C, is a product of
&quot;shale barrens and other dry soils.&quot; These were followed by Nodding
Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>), 
Maidenhair Fern (<i>Adiantum pedatum</i>), 
Christmas Fern, Shrubby St Johns Wort, Abundant Wild Stonecrop,<i>
Polemonium reptans</i>, Clustered
Snakeroot and Sugar Maple. Here a soil sample (no 1) was taken from a 2-3
inch (5-8 cm) depth among clasts and flagstones. This soil, which was
apparently rich in organic matter, had an initial pH of 5.0, but after 24 hours
this had decreased to 4.6.
<p> Next seen
were Wild Ginger (<i>Asarum canadense</i>), Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Gallium 
triflorum</i>), Wood Nettle, White Snakeroot ( <i>Eupatorium rugosum</i>) in bloom, More Virginia Creeper and White Ash
seedlings, Foam Flower (<i>Tiarella 
cordifolia</i>), a little Blue Cohosh in fruit; then the striking and
edible fungus <i>Lactarius indigo</i>
under Hemlock, followed by Rattlesnake Fern, a basswood, Common Many Knees (<i>Polgonatum biflorum</i>), more Poison Ivy and a little
Bloodroot (<i>Sanguinaria canadensis</i>), 
no doubt a remnant of that already gone dormant. These were followed in turn by
Roundlobe Hepatica, Spice Bush, Virginia Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum</i>), Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>), the moss<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i> (Delicate Fern Moss) on
rock, the fungus <i>Amanita citrina</i>
and a few plants of Canada Moonseed under Yellow Buckeye.
<p> Still
moving up-valley, we saw more Roundlobe Hepatica, <i>Hygrophorus conicus</i>, a fungus characteristic of
&quot;coniferous woods&quot; (Phillips, 1991), Maidenhair Fern, Wild Ginger,
Marginal Shield Fern, Common Chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>), Cucumbertree, possible Small's Ragwort (<i>Senecio smallii</i>), an unidentified<i>Prenanthes</i>,
Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, an unidentified<i>Brachythecium</i> moss,
Lance-leaf Wild Liquorice (<i>Galium lanceolatum</i>), a little Wide-leaved
Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium purpureum</i>) 
and a jewelweed (<i>Impatiens</i> sp
). Elsewhere however, we saw Spotted Jewelweed or <i>I</i>. <i>capensis</i>. At this location we also
again encountered the surface – crawling earthworms.
<p> We next
came to a patch of slightly elevated ground, perhaps two square meters in area,
on which the ground cover was dominated by a narrow-leaved sedge resembling <i>Carex gracilescens</i>. Near the center of this
patch stood a small bush of Bladdernut, the only example of the species seen on
our traverse. A soil sample (no 2) was taken from a 2-3 inch depth and
between clasts at the center of the patch. This sample produced uncertain
results, but appeared less acidic than what might be expected from the general
flood plain flora. Its pH initially appeared to exceed 6.0, but after 24 hours
a value of 5.5 was obtained.
<p> A little
farther up-valley we recorded Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum acerifolium</i>) and a Wild Ginger with
an unusual leaf shape in which the cordate sinus was closed. These were
followed by Lopseed, and then, in a semi-opening, by a large patch dominated by
Hay-scented Fern with associated blooming Wingstem, Tall White lettuce (<i>Prenanthes altissima</i>), Horse Balm, Christmas Fern,
the tick trefoil <i>Desmodium nudiflorum</i>
 (also in bloom), Broad Beech Fern (<i>Phegopteris hexagonoptera</i>), Common Greenbrier, Fringed Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia ciliata</i>), Blue Cohosh, a<i>
Cantharellus</i> fungus, a seedling of Bitternut Hickory, Hog Peanut, Tree Moss
(<i>Climacium</i> <i>americanum</i>), 
Wild Ginger, and Black Elderberry. A soil sample (no 3) taken from a 2-3 inch
depth in this patch was surprisingly acidic, with an initial pH of 4.6.
However, after 24 hours this increased to 5.6, which may have indicated a
slowly reacting carbonate or other component in the soil.
<p> A
conspicuous faunal element on this traverse was the biting black flies (
Simuliidae).
<p> Additional
plants from the flood plain, but not specifically located, or possibly
influenced by road gravels, were as follows:<i>Desmodium glutinosum</i>, Downy Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum pubescens</i>) at the base of a White Pine,
Beech Drops (<i>Epifagus virginiana</i>
) and Woodland Muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia 
sylvatica</i>) .
<p> Additional
fungi collected on this traverse (from soil substrate unless otherwise
indicated) and identified by R. Hunsucker were the following:
<p>&nbsp;
<br><i>Agaricus</i> sp
<br><i>Amanita 
bisporigera</i> – <i>virosa </i>complex
<br><i>Amanita caesarea</i>
<br><i>Amanita fulva</i>
<br><i>Auricularia 
auricula</i>
<br><i>Baeospora myosura</i>– on White Pine cones
<br><i>Bisporella 
citrina</i> – on rotting hardwood
<br><i>Boletus 
chrysenteron</i>
<br><i>Cantharellus 
cibarius</i>
<br><i>Cantharellus 
laterinus</i>
<br><i>Clavariadelphis 
truncates</i>
<br><i>Collybia 
dryophila</i>
<br><i>Collybia </i> sp
<br><i>Cortinarius </i> spp
<br><i>Entoloma 
salmoneum</i>
<br><i>Gloeophyllum 
sepiarium </i>– on rotting pine
<br><i>Gymnopilus </i> sp
– on buried wood
<br><i>Hygrocybe coccinea</i>
<br><i>Hygrocybe conice</i>
<br><i>Inocybe</i> spp
<br><i>Laccaria laccata</i>
<br><i>Lactarius peckii</i>
<br><i>Lactarius 
piperatus</i>
<br><i>Lactarius 
repraesentaneus</i>
<br><i>Lactarius 
subplinthogalus</i>
<br><i>Lactarius</i> spp
<br><i>Lepiota </i> sp
<br><i>Leptonia </i> sp
<br><i>Marasmius rotula</i>
 
<br><i>Marasmius </i> spp
<br><i>Mycena 
galericulata </i>– on rotting stump
<br><i>Panellus 
stipticus</i> – on rotting hardwood stumps
<br><i>Peziza </i>sp
<br><i>Polyporus 
squamosus </i>– on rotting stump
<br><i>Psathyrella sp</i>
<br><i>Russula </i> sp
<br><i>Stereum 
complicatum</i>
<br><i>Stereum ostrea</i>
<br><i>Suillus 
americanus </i>
<br><i>Suillus 
granulatus</i>
<br><i>Suillus pictus</i>
<br><i>Suillus 
salmonicolor</i>
<br><i>Tremella 
concrescens</i>
<br><i>Tricholoma </i> sp
<br><i>Xerula furfuracea</i>
<br><i>Xylaria polymorpha</i>
 
<p> Pileated
Woodpeckers (<i>Dryocopus pileatus</i>
) were virtually the only birds identified on the traverse. Crickets and
katydids called loudly at camp during the late evening.
<p> On 9-5-00,
after a night of periodic light rain and cooling temperatures, a determination
was made of the pH of Anthony Creek. The value of 5.3 obtained may have
reflected the recent rainy period, conspicuously high water and likely
resulting acidification.







<p> A morning
traverse was then made downstream along the left bank of the Creek, essentially
through the same habitat traversed on our 1993 visit. The trail here passes
through the ecotone between the terrace and stream edge and the base of Round
Mountain. The latter was dominated in many places by a heavy growth of great
Rhododendron, which occupied much of the rocky slope. Initially the trail
passed through forested flood plain, less rocky, and far richer in appearance
than that inventoried on the Creek's northwest side. The canopy near the foot
bridge at the start of the traverse consisted of some large (up to 38
inches / 1 m dbh or more) Tuliptree, Yellow Buckeye, Sugar Maple, Black
Walnut, Northern Red Oak and on the Creek bank, River Birch (<i>Betula nigra</i>) . Muscletree appeared to be
dominant in the understory. Other species noted here were Spice Bush, Woodland
Muhly, blooming Wingstem, Virginia Knotweed (<i>Polygonum virginianum</i>), Honewort (<i>Cryptotaenia canadensis</i>), blooming Spotted
Jewelweed, the alien mint <i>Elsholtzia 
ciliata</i>, Black Locust, Hispid Greenbrier,<i>Carex gracilescens</i>, Christmas Fern, abundant
Golden Ragwort, Enchanter's Nightshade (<i>Circaea quadrisulcata</i>), Sensitive Fern,
Indian Turnip, an unidentified <i>Anomodon</i> moss on a large Buckeye, Black
Cohosh and Winterberry Holly (<i>Ilex 
verticillata</i>) . A soil sample (no 4) taken from a 2-3 inch depth
here was rich in organic matter, but was surprisingly acidic, with an initial
pH of 4.6. However, after 24 hours this had increased to 5.2, perhaps again
indicating slow equilibration with a more alkaline soil component.
<p> Continuing
downstream we saw Wood Nettle, Nodding Fescue, Wood Reed Grass (<i>Cinna arundinacea</i>), Sweet White Violet, False
Nettle (<i>Boehmeria cylindrical</i>), 
Clearweed, Black Birch, Virginia Waterleaf, Virgin's Bower, (<i>Clematis virginiana</i>), the alien grass<i>
Microstegium veminium</i>, an
unidentified dodder (<i>Cuscuta </i> sp
) and Wild Stonecrop.
<p> We now
arrived at the narrowing of the stream flood plain / terrace and in close
proximity to the Rhododendron covered slope base. In what follows species on
the slope base are indicated by (s) and those of the open Creek edge as (e):
Seen successively were Tall Meadowrue (
<i>Thalictrum pubescens</i>) (e), <i>Carex plantaginea</i>(s), Maidenhair Fern (s), Small yellow Crownbeard(e), Shagbark
Hickory(s), Delicate Fern Moss(s), small Striped Maple(s), a large patch of
Wingstem(e), Tall Coneflower (<i>Rudbeckia 
laciniata</i>) (e), Wild Cucumber (<i>Echinocystus lobata</i>) (e), Thin-leaved Sunflower (<i>Helianthus</i> <i>decapetalus</i>) (e), Grass-leaved
Goldenrod (<i>Euthamia graminifolia</i>
)(e), Northern Bugelweed (<i>Lycopus 
uniflorus</i>) (e), Creeping Phlox (<i>Phlox stolonifera</i>) (s), Wild Hydrangea(s), the fungus <i>Suillus pictus</i>(s), Marginal Shield Fern(s), an
unidentified <i>Atrichum</i> moss(s) and seedlings of Shagbark hickory(s).
<p> On a
particularly rocky slope base we noted Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium</i> <i>virginianum</i>) (s), Partridge Berry(s),
the moss <i>Bryoandersonia illecebra</i>(s)
and an unidentified<i>Heuchera</i>(s). These were followed by large, vigorous
American Spikenard(s) in fruit and Flowering Raspberry (<i>Rubus odoratus</i>) (s). The rock here appeared to
be horizontally – bedded, fissile siltstone. 
<p> Continuing
along the ever steepening slope, we saw
Black Elderberry(s) and Crooked-stem Aster (<i>Aster prenanthoides</i>) (s)then at the water's edge, New York Ironweed
(<i>Vernonia noveboracensis</i>) (e),
Cardinal Flower(e) and Great Blue Lobelia(e), all in spectacular bloom.
<p> Still
within the ecotone, we encountered Autumn Bent grass (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>) (s), Tasslerue (<i>Trautvetteria caroliniensis</i>) (e), Dotted St Johns Wort
(<i>Hypericum punctatum</i>
)(e), Mountain Maple(s), Thyme-leaved Bluets (<i>Houstonia serpyllifolia</i>) (s), Small-flowered St
Johns Wort (<i>Hypericum mutilum</i>) (s) and Upright Yellow Wood
Sorrel (<i>Oxalis stricta</i>) (s);
then, at the stream edge, Ninebark (<i>Physocarpus opulifoius</i>) (e), Common Joe-pye Weed(e) and Rice Cutgrass (<i>Leersia oryzoides</i>) (e). Again on the slope were
Beech(s), the alien bedstraw <i>Galium 
parisense</i>(s), Broad-leaf Goldenrod(s), Downy Many Knees(s), Goat's
Beard (<i>Aruncus dioicus</i>) (s),
Hairy Heuchera(s), Maidenhair Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium trichomanes</i>) (s), Wild ginger(s) and the
mosses <i>Bartramia pomiformis</i> (
Apple Moss) (s) and <i>Mnium hornum</i>(s).
Here also other mosses were collected from the rock an vicinity for later
identification (see following list) .
<p> The canopy
on the slope here included Hemlock and White Basswood, with associated Wild
Sarsaparilla, the alien Coltsfoot (<i>Tussilago farfara</i>), Arrow-leaf Tearthumb (<i>Polygonum sagittatum</i>) and a large patch of earth
star fungus (<i>Geastrum </i> sp) .
Still on the slope, which now extended to the stream edge, we saw the colorful
fungus <i>Marasmius siccus</i> (Orange
Pinwheel) in association with Intermediate Shield Fern, a seedling of
Bitternut hickory and abundant Maidenhair Fern. A little beyond, a soil sample
 (no 5), light tan in color and apparently rich in clay and low in organic
matter, was taken from beneath Apple Moss and the moss <i>Hylocomium brevirostre</i>. Other associates included
unidentified <i>Atrichum</i> and <i>Hypnum</i> mosses, Goat's Beard, Maidenhair
Fern, Foam Flower, Christmas Fern, Poison Ivy, Mountain Maple, Virginia
Creeper, Tall White Lettuce, Curtis Goldenrod and Downy many Knees. This sample
was, as expected, acidic, with pH= 4.7, both initially and 24 hours later. On
drying it formed lumps so hard they could not be broken with the fingers, thus
supporting its clay-rich character.
<p> Additional
species collected and identified by R. Hunsucker on this traverse included a
Handsome Fungus Beetle (Endomychidae) feeding inside the edible puffball <i>Lycoperdon pyriforme</i>, as well as the following
bryophytes (liverworts explicitly indicated):
 <p>
 <i>Anomodon 
attenuatus</i>
<br><i>Atrichum crispum</i>
<br><i>Aulocomnium 
heterostichum</i> – on soil and rotting wood
<br><i>Brachythecium 
oxycladon</i>
<br><i>Brachythecium 
rutabulum</i>
<br><i>Bryhnia 
graminicolor</i>
<br><i>Campylium 
chrysophyllum</i> – on wet rocks and soil
<br><i>Diplophyllum 
apiculatum </i>– liverwort on wet rocks
<br><i>Frullania inflata
</i>– liverwort on rocks
<br><i>Geocalyx 
graveolens</i> – liverwort<br>
<i>Hypnum curvifolium</i>
<br><i>Odontoschisma 
denudatum</i> – liverwort on humus and rotting wood
<br><i>Plagiochila </i> sp – liverwort
<br><i>Plagiothecium curvifolium</i>
<br><i>Scapania nemorosa</i>
– liverwort<i></i>
<br><i>Tetraphis 
pellucida</i> – on rotting stumps
 
<p> Our
traverse along the stream was prematurely terminated as a consequence of the
obliteration of the trail by a landslide on the steep slope. Consequently we
did not reach the markedly calciphile communities encountered on our 1993
traverse.
 
<p> In the
afternoon of 9-5-00, under clear, cool conditions, we ascended Round Mountain
via a trail up the north face. The first section of the trail extended
northeast on a gentle slope bordering the flood plain of Anthony Creek.
Successively encountered were Oyster Mushroom (<i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>), beautifully straight and
tall Hemlock, Tuliptree, Northern Red Oak and White Pine, common Great
Rhododendron in places, but much open forest with few shrubs and herbs. Among
these however, were New york Fern, Hairy Disporum, Christmas Fern, Sweet White
Violet, Partridge Berry, Roundlobe Hepatica, Hispid Greenbrier, <i>Carex debilis</i>, Black Cohosh, Downy Many Knees
and Carrion flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>
). These were followed by White Ash, Intermediate Shield fern, Lance-leaved
Wild Liquorice, White Pine to 30 inches (0.76 m) dbh or more and Miterwort.
Here the trail (no 614) turned sharply right and began its ascent. First
noted on this steeper slope were Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda claytoniana</i>), Yellow Buckeye, Spice
bush and saplings of Hemlock; then under a mature canopy, Christmas Fern, the
call of a Pileated Woodpecker, Cucumbertree, Bitternut Hickory and Virginia
Waterleaf.
<p> Continuing
along the steep colluvial slope, now with a greater herb density, we saw Great
Chickweed, <i>Carex platyphylla</i>, an
unidentified <i>Atrichum</i> moss, Blue Cohosh, Wild Geranium, a fallen tree
with a rootwad that exposed a light tan soil and subsoil with many small clasts
but little organic matter; then stunted Indian Turnip, Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia perfoliata</i>), the somewhat uncommon
fungus <i>Wynnea americana</i>, Sugar
Maple, Maidenhair Fern, Black Birch, Intermediate Shield Fern, seedlings of
Yellow Buckeye, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain and White Clintonia (<i>Clintonia umbellulata</i>) .
<p> These were
followed by abundant Great Rhododendron, Interrupted Fern, the moss<i>
Rhodobryum roseum</i>, saplings of
Striped Maple, abundant unidentified mosses of the genra <i>Mnium</i> and <i>Atrichum</i>;
then by more Great Rhododendron and the fungi <i>Lactarius chrysorrheus </i>and the excellent edible
Sweet Tooth (<i>Hydnum repandum</i>) .
The canopy here was dominated by Hemlock, Black Birch and Northern Red Oak,
with an undergrowth of Great Rhododendron. However, the up-slope trail bank,
almost free of Rhododendron and other tall plants, was covered by a continuous
dense blanket of mosses and lichens, with scattered other small plants.
Frequent genra of mosses at this level of the trail were <i>Mnium</i>, <i>Thuidium</i>
and <i>Hypnum</i>, with some cushions of <i>Leucobryum glaucum</i>. The base of a large Northern
Red Oak was occupied by the fungi <i>Amanita 
vaginata</i> and <i>Lactarius 
piperatus</i>.
<p> With the
canopy still dominated by Hemlock, Black Birch and Northern Red Oak, the trail
turned sharply left. At the trail side, under Rhododendron, were the fungi <i>Lactarius volemus</i> and<i>Strobilurus conigenoides </i>with the latter growing on
the cone of a Cucumbertree. Following these we saw the fungus <i>Rickenella fibula</i> in a bed of <i>Hypnum </i>moss;
then the first Chestnut Oak, the fungi <i>Clavaria fusiformis</i> (Golden Spindles) and the edible <i>Tricholomopsis platyphylla</i> (&quot;Platterful&quot;) .
Next seen were dense intergrowths of mosses, including an unidentified species
of <i>Hypnum </i>and <i>Leucobryum 
glaucum</i>, with scattered Tall White Lettuce.
<p> Still
climbing, we again noted White Clintonia; then abundant saplings of Hemlock,
Downy Many Knees, one of the few Red Maple seen on the traverse, the fungus <i>Ramaria stricta</i>, a few saplings of Yellow
Buckeye and a decrease in the amount of Great Rhododendron. A little higher we
came upon the fungi <i>Paxillus 
involutus </i> (deadly!) and <i>Cortinarius iodes</i>, the latter being very attractive and characteristic of
&quot;wet coniferous and wet mixed woods&quot; but &quot;uncommon in eastern
North America&quot; (Phillips, 1991) .
<p> We now
arrived at the first overlook, which was to the northeast. The overlook area
was somewhat cleared of trees but surrounded by Sugar Maple, Shagbark Hickory,
Northern Red Oak and Beech, all of small stature. Given the mesic character of
this stand in comparison with those
just traversed on the slope below, it is possible that a more base-rich stratum of rock occurs here than
on the latter.
<p> The trail
here took a sharp right turn in its steep ascent of the ridge. Species initially encountered along this section were stunted Black
Locust, the fungi <i>Amanita rubescens </i> (The Blusher) and the
eminently edible<i>Tricholoma 
flavovirens</i>, while an unidentified <i>Hypnum</i> was a common
trailside moss. As we continued our ascent, we could see Scarlet Oak on the
slope above, and near the trail, Chestnut and White Oaks, all small to moderate
in size. Here, also along the trail, we encountered our first blueberries,
Upland Low (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>) and Deer Berry (<i>V. stamieum</i>). Then, after tallying Black Oak, we became aware of a substantial increase,
as intergrowth with mosses, of an 
unidentified <i>Cladina</i> lichen that had been far less common at
lower elevations. Also new at the trailside were Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigaea repens</i>), Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria</i> <i>procumbens</i>) and Rattlesnake Weed (<i>Hieracium venosum</i>) in association with Mountain
Laurel, Bushy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum 
dichotomum</i>) and Southern Bellflower (<i>Campanula divaricata</i>) . All were overshadowed by
Great Rhododendron. Still climbing, we again became aware of an apparent
increase in moss cover on the trail bank. Taxa that appeared to be dominant
were unidentified species of <i>Hypnum</i> and <i>Dicranum</i>, likely <i>Dicranum scoparium</i>. Also conspicuous here was the
size of Great Rhododendron, these being the largest we had seen in the area,
including the flood plain. Next noted was an unidentified fungus of the genus <i>Albatrellus</i>;
then, on the trail a few leaves of Bigtooth Aspen (<i>Populus grandidentata</i>) indicating a nearby tree,
also quite abundant Chestnut Oak, the fungus <i>Amanita citrina</i> and a large patch of <i>Leucobryum
– Hypnum</i> moss intergrowth. More interesting was our next discovery, a few
plants of the boreal Early Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium angustifolium</i>), here with Upland Low
Blueberry, Rattlesnake Weed, Black Gum, Creeping Five – leaf and a little Wild
Lily of the Valley (<i>Convallaria 
Montana</i>).
<p> We now
arrived at the second overlook, also partially cleared of trees, and, like the
first, occupied by a somewhat more mesic flora than the slope just traversed.
This included at least some saplings of White Ash, Woodland Sunflower (<i>Helianthus</i> <i>divaricatus</i>) and Hare Figwort (<i>Scrofularia lanceolata</i>).
<p> A soil
sample was taken near the trail, from beneath an inch (2.5 cm) thick layer of
mor near Trailing Arbutus, Rattlesnake Weed, Teaberry, Creeping Five-leaf,
acidiphile mosses and Chestnut Oak. This soil, light tan in color, was
apparently silt-rich, since, on drying, it could be readily broken up with the
fingers. A pH of 4.5 was obtained both initially and 24 hours later.

<p><i> </i>Of the identified species in this list and in the text only 13 also occur in our list
of flood plain species. The greater diversity and abundance of fungi in the
highly acidic habitats of Round Mountain relative to those on the less acidic
flood plain and stream side habitats is similar to our observations at Otter
Creek (see <a href=ottercreek.htm>our section on Otter Creek</a>).

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<p>&nbsp;
<p> Although
the Blue Bend / Round Mountain area falls within the Valley and Ridge province,
its position on the western edge of the province has resulted in more mesic
forest regime than forests to the east (Braun, 1950) . This is indicated by
the greater prevalence of Sugar Maple, Yellow Buckeye, Beech and other mesic
species and particularly by the abundance of Great Rhododendron on the slopes
of Round Mountain as well as at lower elevations
<p>The greater acidity of the Round
Mountain slope habitat relative to those of the flood plain and stream side is
consistent with expected more resistant and hence more siliceous rocks on the
Mountain. Also consistent is the intermediate acidity of the flood plain, 
dominated as it is by siliceous alluvium but bearing other material as well,
and the limited occurrence of the most markedly calciphile species on the
stream side colluvial slopes where calcareous rocks are most likely to be
intersected. These observations should be viewed in terms of general stability
relations involving the various bedrock types, resulting soil substrates,
topography and elevations (Mueller,2000) . In particular, certain species such
as Great Rhododendron, Chestnut Oak, White Ash and Early Low Blueberry serve as
indicators of these relations.
