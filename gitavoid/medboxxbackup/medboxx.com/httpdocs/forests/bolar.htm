<h3>Source Walk: 3-23-97, cool, somewhat windy, cold on ridge</h3>

Bolar Mountain, a low ridge in the western folded Appalachians of Virginia, lies southwest 
of and along the regional strike from the Blowing Springs Area. Interest in the 
area stems in part from likelihood of the presence of similar rocks and soils to 
those of Blowing Springs and as an extension of this biologically-rich area.  As at 
Blowing Springs there is inferred to be a sequence of shales, siltstones, sandstones, 
limestones and cherts of Lower Devonian and/or Upper Silurian ages.  Although much 
of Bolar Mountain is in private hands, the southern end is part of the T.M. Gathright State 
Wildlife Management Area, which includes Lake Moomaw, an empoundment of the Jackson 
River.<p>
An approach to the area is through scenic Richardson Gorge of the Jackson River via 
State Route 603.  Our inventory traverse of the Mountain extended along a gated road 
that crosses it and which originates on Route 603 about two thirds of a mile (1.1 
km) south o the McClintic Point Campground on an arm of Lake Moomaw.  Elevation at the 
starting point is 1621 feet (494 meters) asl.  The traverse may conveniently be divided 
into four sections.  The first of these, a little over a half mile (0.8 km) in length, extends northwest in a gentle ascent.  The second section is essentially at a right 
angle to the first and follows the southeast side of a deep ravine directly up the 
mountain.  The third section is again at an almost right angle to the second and 
follows the side of the same ravine to the ridge crest.  The fourth section extends southwest 
along the ridgetop following the "Sweet Acorn Trail," but only for a short distance.<p>
The trees, bare-branched at this season, even at the lowest elevations, are mostly 
young, but with scattered mature ones 2 feet (0.6 meters) dbh or greater.  On the 
gentle slope toward the reservoir the forest is somewhat mesic with Black Cherry, 
Sugar and/ or Black Maple.  However along the first section of the traverse it is more xeric 
in character as indicated by abundant Black and White Oaks and minor Northern Red 
Oak, Pignut Hickory and Pitch Pine, although Tuliptree, Black Birch and a few Hemlock 
occur as well.  Some shallow ravines also contain Sycamore.  Flowering Dogwood is everywhere 
present as understory, while the shrub layer contains Mountain Laurel, Upland Low 
Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>) and St. Andrew's Cross (<i>Hypericum hypericoides</i>) in dry areas,and Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>) where more moisture is available.  Occasional large Grape vines (probably <i>Vitis 'stivalis</i>) festoon trees.<p>
Herbs observed at this season were mostly evergreen or last year's remnants such as 
Christmas Fern  (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>), Plantain-leaved Pussytoes (<i>Antennaria plantaginifolia</i>), Golden Aster (<i>Chrysopsis</i>
 <i>moriana</i>), Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>), Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio aureus</i>), Poverty Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia spicata</i>), an unidentified Stonecrop (<i>Sedum</i>
  sp.), Alum Root (<i>Heuchera</i>
  sp.), the sedge <i>Carex pensylvanica</i>, Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Climaphila maculata</i>), and Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>).  Most of these are consistent with a rather severe xeric and acid environment. 
 Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>) also occurs and appears to increase along the trail as does Black Birch.  The road 
bank along this traverse was also the locus of a diverse and luxuriant cover of mosses 
that included such acid lovers as <i>Dicranum scoparicum</i>, Wheat Moss (<i>Diphysicum foliosum</i>), <i>Leucobryum</i>
  cushions, Apple Moss (<i>Bartramia pomiformis</i>), Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>), possible <i>Hedwigia ciliata</i>, <i>Aulacomnium heterostichum</i>
  and <i>Cirriphyllum boscii</i>.<p>
Although conditions along this part of the traverse are prevailing acid, it is possible 
that some rock strata contain calcareous concretions based on our finding some of 
the latter in the area.  However soils generally appear sandy and intermediate between mull and mor types.<p>
Along the second section of the traverse, which has a generally northeast aspect, 
there is a dramatic increase in mesic species of trees, shrubs and herbs, particularly 
ferns on the road bank.  Luxuriant growths of Christmas and Intermediate Shield Ferns, Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>) as well as a little Maidenhair Fern (<i>Adiantum pedatum</i>) and Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda claytoniana</i>) are intergrown with Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea arborescens</i>).  Here also Roundlobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica americana</i>) was already in bloom.  It is likely that this lush fern growth heralds an increase 
in soil lime as well as a response to the added moisture that results from the northeast 
aspect.  Tuliptree appears to be by far the most abundant canopy species, but Black Birch is also common.  Other species include Red Maple (then in bloom), White Ash, 
Basswood, including at least some White (<i>Tilia heterophylla</i>) as indicated by old leaves, Bitternut, Shagbark, Mockernut and Pignut Hickories, 
including some <i>Carya ovalis</i>
  ,as determined from last season's nuts, Black Walnut, Slippery Elm, Cucumbertree 
(<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>), Black Gum, Northern Red, Black and White Oaks, Sassafras and a few Beech, some 
as large as 3 ft (0.9 meters) dbh.  Hophornbeam accompanies Flowering Dogwood in 
the understory and Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>) represents vines.<p>
Our anticipation of a limy substrate was confirmed midway along the traverse by a 
limestones outcrop which bore Walking Fern (<i>Camptosorus rhizophyllus</i>) as well as mosses of the genera <i>Brachythecium</i>
  and <i>Anomadon</i>.  Chert also appeared to be present in places and was sometimes difficult to distinguish 
from sandstone and quartzite without breaking the rock.  Other plants noted on this 
mesic slope were Black Raspberry (<i>Rubus occidentalis</i>), Puttyroot (<i>Aplectrum hyemale</i>), Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>), Staghorn Sumac (<i>Rhus typhina</i>) and a <i>Corydalis</i>
 (possibly <i>C. flavula</i>), not yet in bloom.  A Barred Owl was also heard to call here and a small band if 
White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>Sita carolinensis</i>) and a Downy Woodpecker (<i>Picoides pubescens</i>) seen.<p>
The third section of the traverse again had a mostly southeast aspect and, combined 
with an expected increase in the amount of resistant rock toward the ridgetop, resulted 
in a more xeric, acid and oak-rich forest.  A steep slope of sandstone talus not 
far below the crest had large and possibly old growth Chestnut Oak,but Black Oak was 
also conspicuous, and there was some Mountain Laurel here as well.  However the greatest 
number of trees on this slope appear to be 40 years old or younger with only a few 
scattered individuals in the century range.<p>
The fourth section of the traverse extended southwest along the Sweet Acorn Trail. 
 The canopy here seems to be dominated by large, mostly Black, oaks with some White 
Oak, Mockernut and Pignut Hickories.  There are also Red Maple, Black Gum, Black 
Locust and in patches of superior soil groves of Black Walnut.  Flowering Dogwood dominates 
the understory.  In one place, curiously, at the edge of a "wildlife opening" created 
by the State, Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>
) grew in a community of grasses and not particularly indicative of acid conditions.<p>
Although cursory, our survey of Bolar Mountain confirmed the presence of a rock complex 
similar to that at Blowing Springs.  The widespread occurrence of carbonate rocks 
on the mountain is also indicated by depressions, possibly attributable to limestone 
sinkholes, on the topographic map of the area.  These relations indicate not only 
that rich mesic forest types may occur on other parts of the mountain but that the 
influence of these rocks may extend to the larger watershed.  This question will 
be explored in our analysis of the adjacent Bolar Draft.<p>

<h2>Bolar Draft/Mill Creek</h2>
<ul>

<h3>Source Walks: 3-29-97</h3>
Bolar Draft is a narrow linear mountain valley that extends from Back Creek southwest 
to Lake Moomaw.  It is in fact a linear projection of the Back Creek Valley and may 
be a former course of Back Creek, reflecting stream capture.  Its northeast end is 
now drained by Cummings Run into Back Creek, but most of its length is occupied by Mill 
Creek, which drains southwest into Lake Moomaw.<p>
Bolar Draft is bordered on the southeast by Bolar Mountain, the site of diverse Lower 
Devonian and/or Upper Silurian rocks rich in carbonates.  Contrasting with this is 
the northwest valley side which is occupied largely by Devonian Millboro Shale and 
Chemung Formation, consisting of shale, siltstone and nutrient -poor acid soils.  Tributory 
streams originating on Bolar Mountain are short with small watersheds but those draining 
the siliceous rocks to the northwest are larger by a factor of three.  Consequently the waters of Mill Creek are increasingly dominated by acid run-off and subsurface 
flow in the downstream direction.  This situation presents an opportunity to study 
the differential effect of rock types on the floodplain vegetation.<p>
Our exploration of Bolar Draft and Mill Creek began at the former's southwest end 
at Clay Lick Hollow with a short shower and a little thunder but with later clear, 
cool and pleasant air.  Our first traverse extended from the road across the floodplain 
toward Mill Creek, noting that the forest was dominated by an immature, largely White 
Oak canopy with most trees less than 10 inches (25 cm) dbh.  Other trees consist 
of Black Oak, some large, White and Virginia Pines.  Shagbark Hickory and scattered 
Black Walnut.  A little Hophornbeam accompanies Flowering Dogwood and Muscletree in the understory. 
 Closer to the branch stream from Claylick Hollow there are Hemlock (Adelgid-free), 
Red Maple, Beech, White Ash, Tuliptree, Sycamore, Pignut Hickory and a little Sugar Maple.  The forest is generally very open on the floodplain with few shrubs except 
along Mill Creek.  However there is a little Deerberry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i>) and Upland Low Blueberry (probably Vaccinium pallidum).<p>
The herb layer on the floodplain as a whole is well-developed if not --at least in 
this season-- diverse.  It seemed dominated by Spring Beauty (<i>Claytonia virginica</i>) and Trout Lily (<i>Erythronium umbilicatum</i>), both of which were already in full bloom, Roundlobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica americana</i>), with both blue and white flowers, and Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila maculata</i>).  Also common were Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex/canadensis</i>) and Short-leaved Bluegrass (<i>Poa cuspidata</i>), the earliest grass to bloom here.  It is interesting to compare this area with 
the Allegheny Highlands where this degree of advancement in vegetation must wait 
a month or more and Virginia Spring Beauty is replaced by Carolina Spring Beauty 
(<i>Claytonia caroliniana</i>) in a Yellow Birch-Red Maple-Red Spruce forest.  However on this floodplain other 
species were also in evidence, including last year's remains of Bottlebrush Grass 
(<i>Hystrix patula</i>) as well as leaf rosettes of Avens (<i>Geum</i>
  sp.) and a little Saw Brier (<i>Smilax glauca</i>).  Lichens and bryophytes were abundant, particularly on large rocks and tree bases. 
 Identified were <i>Dicranum scoporium</i>
  in frequent association with <i>Hedwigia ciliata</i>
 and fruticose <i>Cladina</i>
  lichen.  The base of a Black Walnut was covered by Tree Moss (<i>Climacium americanum</i>), an <i>Anomodon</i>, an <i>Entodon</i>
  and a <i>Porella</i>
  liverwort. A small White Oak bore, at eye level, a large patch of the moss <i>Forsstroemia  </i>
with its conspicuously up-turned tufts.<p>
As previously stated, where the branch stream discharges across the floodplain the 
forest is more mesic than the general floodplain.  In addition to the mesic canopy 
the north-facing bank bore a rich growth of herbs even at this season.  Present were 
Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>), the sedge <i>Carex plantaginea</i>, Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio aureus</i>), another <i>Senecio</i>, Bedstraw (<i>Galium</i>
  sp.), Apple Moss (<i>Bartramia  pomiformis</i>), Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>) and a moss with conspicuous gemm', <i>Platygyrium repens</i>.  The rock bed load of the branch stream at this point appeared to consist largely 
of siltstone flags with a likely origin in Clay Lick Hollow.  North of the branch, 
in a seepy flat, there was an virtual monoculture of sedge clumps, seemingly of the 
<i>Laxiflora</i>
  groupe.<p>
Along Mill Creek proper the mesic character of the flora is further accentuated.  
All mesic tree species previously listed are present and here are joined by Hawthorn 
(<i>Crat&aelig;gus</i>
  sp.) and in the shrub layer by Spice Bush, Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>), Shrubby St. Johnswort (<i>Hypericum</i>
 <i>prolificum</i>), Bladdernut (<i>Staphlea trifolia</i>), Witch Hazel, Black Haw Viburnum,Black Raspberry (<i>Rubus occidentalis</i>) and the alien Autumn Olive (<i>Elaeagnus umbellata</i>).  Vines noted were Virginia Creeper and Bittersweet (<i>Celastus</i>
  sp.).  In a patch of more than usually acid soil on the streambank Partridge Berry 
(<i>Mitchella repens</i>) formed intergrowths with Fern Moss.  Other herbs in the vicinity of the stream were 
last season's remains of Wingstem (<i>Verbesina alternifolia</i>), Trout Lily, Round-leaf Hepatica, Northern Swamp Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus septentrionalis</i>), Bloodroot (<i>Sanguinaria canadensis</i>), Golden Ragwort, Smooth Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza longistylis</i>), <i>Carex plantaginea</i>
, Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium filix -femina</i>), a Panic Grass, the alien Coltsfoot (<i>Tussilago farfaras</i>) and Wild Garlic (<i>Allium vineale</i>).<p>
The stream at this point has a moderate gradient with banks and bars composed of sandy 
alluvium with abundant sprouting Twisted Sedge (<i>Carex  torta ) , </i>
Eight  inch (20 cm) fish, possibly trout, were seen, and one of our party described 
20 inch (50 cm) suckers lying still in the shallows.  Little other stream life than 
Water Striders was observed in the absence of a more intensive search.  However Wolf 
Spiders were frequent among dead leaves on the floodplain.<p>
Our general impression of the floodplain here was one of rather rich soil, albeit 
rocky and acid in character.  Availability of nutrients is indicated by the great 
abundance of such bulb-forming plants as Spring Beauty and Trout Lily which provide 
good forage for animals and birds such as Wild Turkey.  It is likely however, that the predominance 
of White Oak reflects some soil degradation as a result of timber cutting and/or 
destructive agricultural practices.  Hopefully the forest will diversify --if protection continues under present management!<p>
After our noon meal, during which we followed the motions of Turkey Vultures riding 
air currents above Bolar Mountain, we made our way up Clay Lick Hollow for a short 
distance.  Here the dominance of White Oak continued, but trees were even smaller 
than on the Mill Creek floodplain.  Included also among them were Black Oak, White Pine, 
Shagbark Hickory, Flowering Dogwood and Service Berry (<i>Amelanchier arborea</i>), with Red Maple, Beech, White Ash and Muscletree close to the stream.  Shrubs were 
almost restricted to Witch Hazel and a little Mountain Laurel.  A sparse ground cover 
consisted of Teaberry<i> (Gaultheria procumbens</i>) Trout Lily and a little Puttyroot (<i>Aplectrum hyemale</i>).  At a stream side shale outcrop Cliff Stonecrop (<i>Sedum glacophyllum</i>) grew on the rock face.  A soil profile at the same location revealed what appeared 
to be a poorly-developed mor, yellow in color,and homogenous with depth.  Mosses 
noted were <i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>
  and <i>Leucobryum</i>
  cushions.  Neither the latter nor Teaberry had been observed on the Mill Creek floodplain.<p>
Poverty Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia spicata</i>
) was abundant, particularly where it was invading a clearing created by bulldozing 
and fertilization some time ago, but which had (happily!) been neglected and was 
once more turning acidic.  We passed three of these clearings, which were also being 
invaded  by Black Locust.  In their vicinity we observed some Northern Red Oak, several 
Bluebirds, and in the forest at least six nests, several of which were a foot (0.3 
meters) or more in diameter stick nests, while the rest were leaf nests of squirrels. 
 Careful scrutiny was required to distinguish them from Witches Broom which was also present. 
 Although our rapid passage precluded more faunal observations other than birds, 
we did encounter a large 0.75 inch (2 cm) active black Scarab Beetle.<p>
The markedly less fertile soils of this hollow as compared to the Mill Creek floodplain,were 
indicated not only by the presence of Teaberry and <i>Leucobryum</i>
  moss, but also by the absence of Spring Beauty and other mesic herbs which formed 
so large a component of the floodplain flora.<p>
Our next traverse was made along Mill Creek about three miles (5 km) upstream from 
Clay Lick Hollow, at Buckhorn Draft.  The floodplain here appears to be the site 
of a former clearing now being reclaimed by forest.  Soils appear to be less acid 
and richer than those of the Mill Creek floodplain at Claylick Hollow.  Trees are small but 
Black Walnut is common and accompanied by other mesic species such as Butternut, 
Black Cherry, White Ash, Shagbark Hickory and near the stream, Sycamore.  However 
White Oak is also common.  Hawthorn is of frequent occurrence, especially in openings, and Spice 
Bush, Shrubby St. Johnswort, Black Raspberry, a Thorned Blackberry as well as Ninebark 
(<i>Physocarpus opulifolius</i>) along the stream, form a shrub layer.  Golden Ragwort, already in bloom, is especially 
abundant but mosses and lichens seem to be confined to salients of siliceous rocks 
which contain <i>Dicranum</i> and <i>Cladina</i>.  Also associated with these rocks is some Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>).<p>
At this point Mill Creek undercuts the steeply -rising slope of Bolar Mountain , which 
 is covered by a rich canopy consisting of Beech, Black Birch, Tuliptree, Red Maple 
and other mesic species, while fragments  of limestone occur in the creekbed. Here 
the presence  of alien watercress (<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>) indicates more alkaline water than downstream.  The occurrence of the acid-mesic 
forest on the slope  is probably a result of vertical leaching, while the stream 
is fed largely by underground water flowing through limestone -- a conclusion which 
of course involves some speculation.<p>
Further indicating hospitable waters were crayfish we uncovered beneath rocks, as 
well as abundant small fish in the stream.  In most openings on the floodplain a 
heavy cover of last season's dried grasses and forbs contained identifiable Deer 
Tongue Grass (<i>Panicum clandestinum</i>), Goldenrods (<i>Solidago</i>
  sp.) and other Asterace'.  These were accompanied by thickets of Thorned Blackberry 
and alien Multiflora Rose (<i>Rosa multiflora</i>), which in other areas Spice Bush and Shrubby St. Johnswort were the dominant shrubs. 
 Where a side seep created a small pond adjacent to the stream below the bank, grew 
Common Water Plantain (<i>Alisma subcordata</i>) as well as green alg&aelig;.  Numerous small fish (Minnows?) also inhabited this little 
bit of water isolated from the stream.  It should be mentioned that, as distinguished 
from Mill Creek at Clay Lick Hollow, the rocks of the streambed here appeared to 
have a conspicuous slimy coat , perhaps due to diatoms, alg&aelig; or other organisms favored 
by less acid conditions and nutrient availability.  Manna Grass (<i>Glyceria</i>
  sp.) sprouted vigorously at the stream's edge, and not far downstream, just above 
the junction of the branch stream from Buckhorn Draft, small fish were seen leaping 
for insects from a quiet pool.  As on other walks at this season few birds attracted 
our attention, however here Pileated Woodpeckers were an exception.<p>
Some mosses and liverworts from the Mill Creek floodplain at Clay Lick Hollow were 
examined under the microscope by R. Hunsucker.  The following were identified.<p>


<h3>Mosses</h3>
<i>Anomodon attenuatus<br></i>
<i>A. minor<br></i>
<i>A. rostratus<br></i>
<i>Bryum c'spiticium<br></i>
<i>Climacium americanum<br></i>
<i>Dicranella rufescens<br></i>
<i>Ditrichum pallidum<br></i>
<i>Eurhychium riparioides<br></i>
<i>Hygrohypnum eugyrium<br></i>
<i>Thelia asprella<br></i>
<i>Thuidium delicatulum<br></i>
<i>T. minutulum<br></i>
<i>Tortella humilis<br></i>
<i>Ulota crispa<br></i>
<i>Weissia controversa</i>
<p>

<h3>Liverworts</h3>
<i>Calypogeia muelleriana<br></i>
<i>Frullania inflata<br></i>
<i>F. eboracensis<p></i>

 Our survey of Bolar Draft in relation to the contrasting geology of Bolar and Allegheny 
Mountains hints at, if it does not fully disclose, a close dependency of the Draft 
flora -- and of necessity fauna -- on the character of water draining from the two 
areas.  Run-off and groundwater from Bolar Mountain feeding into Mill Creek appear to 
contain a greater quantity of such bases as calcium and magnesium and are consequently 
more alkaline and nutrient-rich than those draining from Allegheny Mountain.  However, because the volume of flow from Allegheny Mountain is so much greater, it in effect 
progressively swamps that from Bolar Mountain downstream.  The result is that the 
relatively rich flora and fauna present along Mill Creek at Buckhorn Draft is present 
in diminished, if still quite rich, form along this stream at Clay Lick Hollow.<p>
Because Bolar Mountain and Draft as well as the adjacent Blowing Springs Area are 
parts of a substantial tract of contiguous public and private wildland, and because 
they contain rich soils, they can play an important role in the ecological recovery 
of the region and should receive full protection from timber cutting and ground disturbing 
activities.
