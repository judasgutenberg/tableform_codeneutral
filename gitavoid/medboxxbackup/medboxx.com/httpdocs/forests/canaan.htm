<b>Source Walks: 9-15-95 and 9-17-95</b><ul> In terms of geologic structure 
Canaan Mountain occupies the southeastern limb of a syncline that borders 
the Canaan Valley anticline.  Like Dolly Sods, it is a dissected tableland, 
but in contrast to the latter, its surface is more completely dominated by 
Pottsville Sandstone.  Drainage of the mountain to the southwest is by Red 
Run (not to be confused with Red Creek of Dolly Sods) and to the north and 
east by tributaries of the Blackwater River.  Elevations are somewhat lower 
than those of the eastern tableland, which includes Dolly Sods, but 
seemingly not enough to moderate the climate.  Canaan Mountain seems to 
have suffered abuses of logging and fires in about the same measure as 
Canaan Valley and the eastern plateau.  However much of the Mountain now 
consists of plantations not only of native Red Spruce but also of the alien 
Norway Spruce
(<i>Picea abies</i>).<p>
	Access to the summit area has unfortunately been made easy by Forest Road 13
which runs southwest from State Route 32 at Canaan Heights.  A spot inventory
was done along FR-13 in an essentially level area about a mile southwest of the
junction at an elevation of about 3800 ft (1160 meters) and in what appeared to
be natural forest.  This forest is quite young, with a canopy of Red Spruce,
Canada Hemlock (<i> Tsuga canadensis</i> ), Red Maple, Yellow and Black Birch
and Beech.  Understory trees are Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier
l&aelig;vis</i>?), Mountain Ash (<i>Pyrus americana </i>), Striped Maple (<i>
Acer pensylvanicum</i> ) and Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana</i>. ).  Shrubs
noted are Mountain Laurel, Wild Raisin (<i> Viburnum cassinoides</i> ), Great
Rhododendron (<i> Rhododendron maximum</i> ) and Sourtop ( <i>Vaccinium
myrtylloides </i>), Early Low (<i> V. angustifolium </i>)and Upland Low  (
<i>V</i>. <i>pallidum </i>) Blueberries.<p>
	Ground cover under and among the trees was dominated by mosses represented by
unidentified species of <i>Sphagnum</i>, <i>Leucobryum</i> and <i>Hypnum</i>
and by <i>Polytrichum</i> <i>juniperinum</i>.  Vascular plants included Canada
Mayflower ( <i>Maianthemum canadense </i>), Grounberry (<i>Rubus hispidus</i>
), Teaberry ( <i>Gaultheria procumbens </i>), Creeping Five-leaf (
<i>Potentilla canadensis/simplex</i>  ), a Willow Herb (probably <i>Epilobium
ciliatum</i>), Northern Bugleweed (<i> Lycopus uniflorus </i>) Common Speedwell
(<i>Veronica officinalis</i>  ) Bog Goldenrod (<i>Solidago</i> <i>uliginosa
</i>), Spinulose Shield ( <i>Dryopteris intermedia </i>), Cinnamon (<i> Osmunda
cinnamomea </i>), Interrupted (<i> O. claytoniana</i> )and Hay-scented (
<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i> ) Ferns, and the Lycopods.  <i>Lycopodium
lucidulum</i>  and <i>L. annotinum</i>.  Species concentrated more in the open
and along the road were Grass-leaved, Wrinkled-leaf and Old Field Goldenrods
(<i>Solidago graminifolia</i>, <i>S. rugosa</i> and <i>S. nemoralis</i>),
Calico Aster (<i>Aster lateriflorus</i>), Mountain Aster (<i>A. acuminatus</i>)
and Flat-top White Aster (<i>A. umbellatus</i>), Fowl Managrass, the Sedge
<i>Carex debilis</i>, Yarrow (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>) and a single small
sickly-looking Christmas Fern ( <i>Polystichum acrostichoides </i>).
Characteristically for these high elevation habitats, there were few vines of
any kind with only Common Greenbriar (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>) visible.<p>
	The next spot inventory was done near the junction of Flag Run Trail with
FR-13 perhaps a mile southwest of the first station and at an elevation of
about 3700 ft (1130 meters).  Interest here is centered on a small (perhaps 30
square yards/meters) community with Large Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium
macrocarpon</i>).  The surrounding forest consists largely of Red Spruce with
minor Yellow Birch and Red Maple.  Seedlings and small saplings encroach on the
cranberry community which occurred on and amidst colorful hummocks of reddish
<i>Sphagnum</i>, yellowed Cinnamon Fern and the white heads of Cottonsedge(<i>
Eriophorum virginicum</i> ), all punctuated by abundant ripe cranberries.
Mosses other than <i>Sphagnum</i> included <i>Philonotis</i>  sp. and
<i>Polytrichum juniperinum</i>.  Additional associates were Sourtop and Early
Low Blueberries, Teaberry, Northern White Violet (<i>Viola pallens  )</i>, the
rushes <i>Juncus effusus</i>, <i>J. brevicaudatus</i>, <i>J. subcaudatus
</i>and <i>J. canadensis</i>, the Beakrush (<i>Rhynchospora capitellata</i>),
Rice Cutgrass (<i>Leersia oryzoides</i>), Nodding Ladies' Tresses
(<i>Spiranthes cernua</i>), and a horsetail (<i>Equisetum</i> sp.).  An
additional attraction here was the elegant fungus <i>Lactarius aquifluous ,
</i>which on breaking, issues a clear liquid.<p>
	A nearby open meadow provided habitat for Rose Polygala (<i>Polygala
sanguinea</i>) and Narrow-leaf Gentian (<i>Gentiana linearis</i>), both in
bloom, as well as Canadian St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum canadense</i>), Dotted
St. Johns-wort (<i>H. punctatum</i>), Northern Bugleweed  and the Linear-leaved
Willow-herb (<i>Epilobium leptophyllum</i>).<p>
	Since the spruce forest here is quite young it possesses even less diversity
than is usual for this forest type.  Typical ground cover is almost confined to
mosses with very little of the leafy liverwort <i>Bazzania trilobata</i> which
is usually common in this forest type.  However a moist opening along the trail
contained a colony of Water Pennywort (<i>Hydrocotyle americana</i>).<p>
	A third spot inventory was motivated by an interesting area encountered along
FR-13 approximately 3/4 mile (1.2 km) southwest of the last station.  The area,
at about 3660 ft (1120 meters) elevation, is a level open heath which extends
southeast to the edge of the tableland.  The entire area, which is drained both
by Red Run and a Blackwater River tributary, appears to be a blockfield of
Pottsville Sandstone but with a rich blanket of heath vegetation.  The area is
striking in aspect at this season with the brilliant foliage of Red Maples, the
dark green of spruce and pine and the varied yellows, reds and greens of lower
shrubs and herbs.  The boreal appearance is such that a Moose would not seem
out of place in the field of view despite the likely absence of this animal
since the Ice Age.<p>
	Canopy tree species in the surroundings and scattered over the open heath are
Red Spruce, Hemlock, White Pine, Red Maple (very abundant), Yellow and Black
Birches and Black Cherry.  Small trees and shrubs include Serviceberry, Black
Chokeberry (<i>Aronia melanocarpa</i>), <i>Nemopanthus</i> <i>mucronata, </i>
Glade St. Johns-wort (<i> Hypericum densiflorum </i>) Wild Raisin, Mtn. Laurel,
Great Rhododendron and Sourtop Blueberry.  The Chokeberry and
<i>Nemopanthus</i>  bore many fruits and even the Sourtop still retained a few
berries.<p>
	A prominent feature of the heath is the heavy cover of mosses
--<i>Sphagnum</i>, <i>Polytrichum commune</i>  and others-- on the large
sandstone blocks, providing a good illustration of soil building in such areas.
Other species providing cover on and among the blocks are abundant Creeping
Snowberry (<i>Gaultheria hispidula</i>), Cotton Sedge, Cinnamon and Bracken (
<i>Pteridium aquilinum </i>)Fern, Tree Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium obscurum</i>  )
and Stiff clubmoss ( <i>L. annotinum )</i>, Narrow-leaved Gentian, Round-leaved
Sundew (<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>), Bog Goldenrod, a Willow-herb (probably
<i>Epilobium ciliatum</i>), the rush <i>Juncus subcaudatis</i>, Dog Hair
Spikerush (<i>Eleocharis tenuous</i>) and inconspicuous Yellow Bartonia
(<i>Bartonia virginica</i>).  Wirestem Muhly Grass (<i>Muhlenbergia
frondosa</i>) and Hairy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum lanuginosum</i>) occur mostly
along the road as does Indian Tobacco (<i>Lobelia inflata</i>).<p>
	A few local prominences, the highest being Cooper Knob, rise as high as 300
feet (90 meters) above the heath and a narrow gap between them acts as an air
spillway as well as a water drainage into the Canaan Valley.  Conditions here
are ideal for drainage/accumulation of air locally and into the Valley below.
However since adiabatic warming results from descent of air into the valley, it
is likely that the coldest climate occurs in the heath itself.<p>
	FR-13 follows the North Fork and eventually the mainstem of Red Run to lower
elevations, where the streamside forest becomes gradually richer, with Canada
Hemlock ( Tsuga canadensis ) and Great Rhododendron more prominent.  However
Yellow and Black Birch and Red Maple also continue abundant while Shining
Clubmoss ( <i>Lycopodium lucidulum  ),</i> Hay-scented Fern and Haircap Moss
seem to dominate the ground cover.  Finally, at somewhat below 3000 ft (910
meters), Tuliptree also enters as a component.  Unfortunately time did not
permit a more thorough inventory of this interesting forest which certainly
deserves closer attention as a link between the upland and the valley below.<p>

<b>Return visit: 7-29-97 to 7-31-97</b><p>
<ul>Our visit began with a faunal experience, namely the presence of a
Black Bear, large but gaunt, beside the road, greeting the first of us to
arrive by vehicle. Although the Bear soon vanished into cover, it had probably
been attracted by the leavings of campers. The incident in the forenoon of
7-29-97, occurred near a familiar camping site near the intersection of Forest
Road 13 and the Flag Run Trail ( reported on above ). The weather was cool for
the season with few clouds and little or no wind.<p>
	We again observed the dominantly Red Spruce forest here, with most trees in
the range of 10 inches ( 25 cm ) dbh. However, for the first time we became
aware of the great variation in color of the Spruce, which ranged through many
shades of green to nearly as blue as Colorado Blue Spruce. Next in frequency to
Spruce appeared to be Red Maple, followed by Yellow Birch. Downy Serviceberry
bearing delicious bluish-red fruit, was common in the understory, while
Mountain Ash, usually an understory component of such forests, was noted only
as seedlings.Other small trees and large shrubs included abundant Mountain
Holly and Great Rhododendron in full bloom and scattered <i>Nemopanthus
mucronata  </i>and Mountain Laurel. Small shrubs were represented by Sourtop
and Early Low Blueberry. Important species of the ground cover under Spruce
were Tree Clubmoss (<i> Lycopodium obscurum </i>) and Common Clubmoss (<i> L.
clavatum</i> ), Creeping Five-leaf ( <i>Potentilla simplex</i> ), Canada
Mayflower, Moccasin Flower ( <i>Cypripedium acaule </i>) and Bracken Fern (<i>
Pteridium aquilinum</i> ). Ground Berry (<i> Rubus hispidus</i> ) was common in
moist areas as was Cinnamon Fern in openings. A pH measurement in surface soil
under Rhododendron yielded a value of 4.5. Common mosses were species of
<i>Hypnum</i> and <i>Leucobryum</i> and the Haircap<i> Polytrichum
juniperinu</i>m.<p>
	 As reported earlier, a notable feature of this location is a small cranberry
bog. On this visit the Large Cranberry were in full flower. An additional plant
identified was the rush <i>Juncus articulatus,</i> a species near the southern
limit of its distribution. The bog was also a center of faunal activity. Each
night Spring Peepers (<i> Hyla crucifer</i> ) called from it, and later in the
evening of 7-30-97, were joined briefly by a Wood Frog ( <i>Rana sylvatica
</i>). During the sunny afternoons swarms of tiny insects danced over Great
Rhododendron blossoms and were periodically blown away by puffs of wind.
Lepidoptera were common and diverse, particularily over the bog, where mostly
small fritillaries were accompanied by Wood Nymphs (<i> Cercyonis pegala </i>)
and Yellows of unidentified species.<p>
	The early morning of 7-31-97 afforded numerous observations of birds. Seen
over the bog and adjacent openings were American Robin (<i> Turdus
migratorius</i> ), Cedar Waxwings (<i> Bombycilla cedrorum </i>) mostly in
treetops, Juncos (<i>Junco hyemali</i> ), Yellow-rumped Warbler (<i> Dendroica
coronata</i> ), Towhee ( <i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus</i> ), and the prize of the
morning, a Common Yellow-throat (<i> Geothlypis trichas </i>), with a
caterpillar in its beak, indicating nearby young. Also seen and heard in the
adjacent spruce forest crowns, were small bands, likely family groups, of
Red-breasted Nuthatch ( <i>Sitta canadensis </i>).<p>
	Additionally, as we returned to camp on 7-29-97 an accipiter, either a female
Sharpshin(<i> Accipiter striatus</i>) or a male Coopers ( <i>A. cooperii </i>)
flew across the road a mile to the east.<p>
