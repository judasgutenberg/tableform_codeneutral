<h1>Canaan Valley</h1>
<ul>
<P>

<h2>General</h2>

<P>

 This remarkable valley is a &quot;biological hot

spot&quot; known for its wealth of disjunct northern species and

extensive wetlands.  It is the site of the Central Appalachian's

only national wildlife refuge since it was designated in 1994.

 Lying at a mean elevation of 3200 ft (975 meters) asl and just

north of the 39&#176; parallel, the Valley's climate resembles

that of similar areas in the Adirondacks of New York.  Like the

Cranesville Wetland complex, Canaan Valley occupies a breached

anticline with a core of Pocono Sandstone and rimming Greenbriar

Limestone, while the Mauch Chunk Formation forms the surrounding

mountain slopes.  Although the valley's climate results in part

from its high elevation, there is also a contribution from the

surrounding topography which consists of plateau-like mountains

that rise 500 to 800 ft (150-240 meters) above it.  Because of

this topography the mountains are themselves areas of accumulation

of cold air which on cool nights spills into the Canaan Valley

in a pre-cooled state.  As a consequence the valley's growing

season is as short as 93 days with subfreezing temperatures recorded

every month of the year.  Cool climate species are also favored

by a yearly precipitation of 51 inches (130 cm) and only 81 cloudless

days.  Although minimum temperatures in the range of -23&#176;F

(-31&#176;C) are not particularly low, the short, cool growing

season largely governs biologic systems here.

<P>

 At fourteen miles (22 km) in length and five miles

(8 km) in width, the Canaan Valley contains approximately 8400

acres (3400 hectares) of wetlands as well as more than 10,000

acres (4,000 hectares) of hemlock-spruce-northern hardwood forest.

 Balsam Fir is also a component of this forest.  All valley forests

are secondary and the same is true for most other vegetation there.

 This is largely a consequence of destructive logging and fires,

beginning in 1863 and continuing past the turn of the century,

and which destroyed a spectacular virgin forest dominated by Red

Spruce and Hemlock (Brooks, 1910).  Further modification resulted

from irresponsible agricultural practices.  The result is thousands

of acres of open wetlands where swamp forest once stood and grass

and forb meadows where forest was cleared for agriculture.  Yet

much of the valley, including these denuded lands, is still covered

with native vegetation which presumably is an early successional

stage preceding ultimate reoccupation by forest.  Also much of

this secondary vegetation, like the primary, is boreal in character

and thus merely involves a change in species ratios.  Of course

it will never be known how many species were lost in the man-made

holocaust.

<P>

 According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service

Fact Sheet, Canaan Valley plant communities of both wetlands and

uplands total at least 40 with 580 species of plants.  Of these,

109 plants have a distinctly northern range.  All ecological types

of wetlands discussed earlier (p.____) are represented.  

<P>

 The native fauna includes 290 species of mammals,

birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes among which there are many

disjunct northern species.  This is particularly true of birds

which include the American Bittern (<I>Botaurus lentiginosus</I>),

Black Duck (<I>Anas rubripes</I>), Northern Goshawk (<I>Accipiter

gentilis</I>), Common Snipe (<I>Capella gallinago</I>) as well

as many other species already recorded for high elevations in

this work.  There is even a record of nesting by the Black-billed

Magpie (<I>Pica pica)</I>, a bird of the western plains and mountains.

 Notable among mammals are the Northern Flying Squirrel, Rock

Vole, Northern Water Shrew, Snowshoe Hare and the Fisher (p.____).

 Many of the valley's wetlands are directly related to the Blackwater

River which drains the valley and this river is habitat for more

than twenty fishes which include a variety of darters, minnows,

dace, suckers and bass as well as both native and introduced trout.

<P>

 Disjunct northern plants uncommon in the Central

Appalachians include Balsam Fir, Glaucus Willow, Alder-leaved

Buckthorn (<I>Rhamnus alnifolius</I>), Nannyberry (<I>Viburnum

lentago</I>), Purple Avens (<I>Geum rivale</I>) and Highbush Cranberry

(<I>Viburnum trilobum</I>), the last named being at its southern

limit in the valley.  Many others too are northern, but like Trembling

Aspen, Fire Cherry and Red Raspberry are more common.  In addition,

there are a number of rare plants, some like Glade Spurge (<I>Euphorbia

purpurea</I>), Swamp Saxifrage (<I>Saxifraga pensylvanica</I>)

and Jacobs Ladder (p.___) are not markedly northern or are Appalachian

while others, like Southern Mountain Cranberry, are abundant mountain

species just to the south but reach their northern limits here.

<P>

 The Blackwater River gathers its waters in numerous

headwater and streamside wetlands and springs.  Because substantial

areas are underlain by Greenbrier Limestone, this formation exerts

its influence on ground and surface waters, which thereby are

made less acid and richer in nutrients than would be the case

if only normal wetland processes such as organic decay were dominant.

 Consequently pH ranges from 6.9 to 7.7 in river water discharged

from the valley (US Fish and Wildlife Service).  Despite this

there are still numerous locations in the valley where acid bog

communities develop in relative isolation from the limestone-buffered

ground water or are swamped by surface water from acid soils upslope.

<h2>Freeland Road Tract</h2>

<br>

<B>Source Walk: 9-16-95, cloudy, ending in rain</B>

<P>

 The Freeland Road Tract, a meadow and wetland 86

acres (35 hectares) in extent, is the first purchased unit of

the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge.  The following traverse

extends northwest from Freeland Road initially through a meadow,

then Balsam Fir groves, shrub swamp and spir&aelig;a thicket to

the northeast boundary stream.  A loop is then made to the southeast

through an alder swamp to the starting point.

<P>

 The meadow adjoining Freeland Road consists of mixed

grass, forbs and sedges which at this season are largely brown

and yellow, perhaps due to early frosts.  The meadow is of course

secondary to the original vegetation, which was probably conifer

or conifer-northern hardwood forest, and to which it seems to

be reverting.  The meadow fringes and grades into an area of scattered

hawthorns, which in turn yield to groves of Balsam Fir behind

which lies a largely shrub swamp.  Species in the meadow-forest

interface are Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<I>Solidago rugosa</I>),

Grass-leaved Goldenrod (<I>S. graminifolia</I>), Bog Goldenrod

(<I>S. uliginosa</I>), large clumps of <I>Carex folliculata</I>,

the rush <I>Juncus subcaudatus</I>, Marsh St. Johns-wort (<I>Hypericum

virginicum</I>), the Hawthorns <I>Crat&aelig;gus punctata</I>

 and <I>C. flabellata</I>  and Balsam Fir.  Here also, where the

affects of grazing still linger, is Rough Cinquefoil (<I>Potentilla

norvegica</I>) and ambiguous, wide-ranging northern species that

could be either native or introduced.  Where there is more moisture

we see the first Meadowsweet (<I>Spir&aelig;a alba</I>) and Doghair

Spikerush (<I>Eleocharis tenuis</I>) also ominously known as &quot;Kill

Cow.&quot; Then farther on, among the groves of Balsam Fir, where

the soil is a little above the zone of saturation, are small communities

of acid soil plants that include Partridge Berry, <I>Rubus hispidus</I>,

Nodding Ladies' Tresses (<I>Spiranthes cernua</I>) as well as

<I>Polytrichum commune</I> and<I> Lycopodium obscurum</I>.

<P>

 In addition to Meadowsweet, plants encountered along

the interface between the wetland and Fir groves are Black Cherry,

Golden Ragwort, Drooping Wood Reedgrass (<I>Cinna latifolia</I>)

in tall golden clumps, Flat-top White Aster (<I>Aster umbellatus</I>),

the Mana Grasses <I>Glyceria striata </I>and <I>G. melicaria</I>

and, in a little open water, the water starwort <I>Callitriche

heterophylla</I>.  Farther along this interface there is Purple-stem

Aster (<I>Aster puniceus</I>), Northern Swamp Buttercup (<I>Ranunculus

septentrionalis</I>), Clayton's Bedstraw (<I>Galium tinctorium</I>)

and Arrowleaf Tearthumb (<I>Polygonum sagittatum</I>), the last

named with its flowers covered by black fungus.

<P>

 Now the traverse enters an area of Spir&aelig;a

interspersed with wet openings occupied by the sedges <I>Carex

gynandra</I>  and <I>C. lurida</I>, Northern Bugle<STRIKE>weed</STRIKE>(<I>Lycopus

uniflorus</I>), Water Smart<STRIKE>weed</STRIKE>(<I>Polygonum

punctatum</I>), Skunk Cabbage (<I>Symplocarpus foetidus</I>) and

Crested Shield Fern (<I>Dryopteris cristata</I>).  In a few adjacent

somewhat dryer areas are found Hay-scented Fern, Panicled Aster

(<I>Aster simplex</I>) and the grass Allegheny Flyback (<I>Danthonia

compressa</I>).  Approaching the boundary and stream vicinity

the growth of Spir&aelig;a thickens and there is some Silky Willow

(<I>Salix sericea</I>).  From these thickets a Gray Catbird called.

 Herbs found in openings in the vicinity were tall, seed-heavy

Rattlesnake Managrass (<I>Glyceria canadensis</I>), a &quot;Bluegrass&quot;

(Poa sp.), Smaller Forget-me-not (<I>Myosotis laxa</I>), Winged

Monkey-flower (<I>Mimulus alatus</I>), the sedge <I>Carex vulpoidea,</I>

Field Mint (<I>Mentha arvensis</I>), Mad-dog Skullcap (<I>Scutellaria

lateriflora</I>), the Spike Rush <I>Eleocharis obtusa</I>, a willow-herb

(probably <I>Epilobium ciliatum</I>) and, in the stream, American

Brooklime (<I>Veronica americana</I>).  Also present here is Yellow

Avens (<I>Geum strictum</I>) one of several members of this genus

in the valley that are subarctic or circumboreal in their ranges.

<P>

 As the traverse looped southeast it entered an area

of Speckled Alder with scattered Red Spruce, Hemlock, Red Maple

and a little White Ash.  Here in a quite moist habitat, a single

tree of Choke Cherry (<I>Prunus virginiana</I>) and a few small

plants of Red Raspberry (<I>Rubus strigosus</I>) were seen.  The

latter species is abundant along Timberline Road a mile north

of this location and perhaps elsewhere in the valley.  Other species

encountered in this alder swamp were Winterberry Holly (<I>Ilex

verticillata</I>), a Skunk Current (<I>Ribes glandulosum</I>),

Virgin's Bower (<I>Clematis virginiana</I>), Canada Brome Grass

(<I>Bromus purgans</I>), Cinnamon and Sensitive Ferns and in more

acid patches a little White Wood Sorrel.  In one place a paper

nest of White-faced Hornets had been disturbed by a bear or other

animal.  Additional species noted as the fir groves were again

approached were the sedge <I>Scirpus cyperinus</I>, a few Yellow

Birch, Dotted St. Johns-wort (<I>Hypericum punctatum</I>), the

circumboreal Beggar Tick (<I>Bidens cernua</I>) and the Common

Horsetail (<I>Equisetum arvense</I>).

<P>

 Of 73 species recorded in the traverse, seventeen

or more are markedly northern in distribution while the rest are

wide-ranging with both northern and southern ranges.  If such

species as <I>Polygonum punctatum</I>, which ranges from Quebec

to tropical America, are excluded, no distinctly southern species

were encountered.

<P>

 From the rich flora of shrubs and herbs and the

lack of ericacea, the soils of this tract appear, with minor exceptions,

to fall in the range of circumneutral pH.  This is in agreement

with the general location which is over Greenbriar Limestone bedrock.

 A possible consequence of this low acid environment may be the

relatively high ratio of Balsam Fir to spruce here since the former

apparently tolerates less acid conditions than the latter (Fowells,

1965).

<P>

<h2>Deer Run/Abe Run Trails</h2>

<br>

<b>Source Walks:6-24-97,6-25-97 and 7-31-97</B>

<P>

 The Deer Run/Abe Run Trail system is located in

Canaan Valley State Park at the base of Canaan Mountain and extends

west from the campground area. Abe Run Trail and the first segment

of the Deer Run Trail form a closed loop, about a mile in length,

that passes through mixed upland forest, open shrub swamp and

coniferous swamp forest. Elevations are near 3200 feet ( 976 meters

) asl on relatively flat terrain. Our inventory consisted of two

counterclockwise traverses of the loop on the mornings of 6-25-97

and 7-31-97 and forays up the Deer Run Trail during the afternoon

and evening of 6-24-97 and 6-25-97.

<P>

 The area in the vicinity of the trails is mapped

as underlain by Greenbrier Limestone ( Cardwell<I> et al</I>,1968

). The sandstone encountered in some of our traverses may be isolated

beds within the Greenbrier or infolded or down-faulted parts of

the overlying Mauch Chunk Group.

<P>

 The first segment of the Deer Run Trail runs through

a tract of northern hardwoods with subordinate conifers. Our inventory

of this forest, on a clear, warm afternoonof 6-24-97, disclosed

a mature canopy dominated by Sugar Maple with smaller amounts

of Red Maple, Beech, Black Cherry, Yellow Birch and Hemlock. Some

of the Red Maple, Black Cherry and Hemlock were of unusual size,

ranging up to 3 feet ( one meter ) dbh. Beech were generally smaller

than other canopy species. Black Cherry had the generally good

form typical of this species in the Alleghenies but not in the

Valley and Ridge.

<P>

 The forest here was quite open with Great Rhododendron

( <I>Rhododendron maximum</I> ) virtually the only understory.

Ground cover was extensive if not particularly diverse and consisted

largely of ferns, sedges and grasses. In places there were large

patches of Hay-scented ( <I>Dennstaedtia punctilobula </I>) and

New York ( <I>Thelypteris noveboracensis</I> ) Ferns, but in most

places sedges and grasses dominated. First among the sedges was<I>

Carex debilis</I>, followed by<I> C. gracillima</I>, with<I> C.

intumescens</I> and<I> C. laxiflora </I>far less common. Among

the grasses Fowl Managrass (<I> Glyceria striata </I>), the forest

bluegrass ( <I>Poa alsodes </I>) as well asother unidentified

species of Poa and other grasses were common. Other herbs sighted

were Intermediate Shield Fern ( <I>Dryopteris intermedia</I> ),

the forest grass <I>Brachyelytrum erectum</I>, abundant White

Wood Sorrel ( <I>Oxalis montana </I>) in full bloom, species of

Violet (<I> Viola  </I>sp ), Northern Swamp Buttercup ( <I>Ranunculus

septentrionalis </I>), Sweet-scented Bedstraw ( <I>Galium triflorum

</I>), a few patches of Canada Mayflower (<I> Maianthemum</I>

<I>canadense,</I> Indian Turnip (<I> Arisaema triphyllum</I> )

and Golden Ragwort ( <I>Senecio aureus</I> ). On our 7-31-97 visit

we saw Thyme leaved Bluets (<I> Houstonia</I> <I>serpyllifolia</I>

) here. Among birds heard and/or seen were Red-eyed Vireos  (<I>Vireo

olivaceus </I>), Blue Jays (<I> Cyanocitta cristata </I>) and

Crows  (<I> Corvus brachyrhynchos </I>), with the last-named doubtless

attracted by the nearby campground. Among insects a small aggressive

deer fly attracted unwelcome attention. Also, small dull- collored

lepidoptera were common.

<P>

 After traversing most of this tract of upland forest,

the trail forks, with the Deer Run Trail continuing to the left

and Abe Run Trail branching to the right. Not far beyond the fork

both trails enter a short stretch of open shrub swamp on board

walks. Along the Deer Run Trail a small stream flows from the

south where the main Park road is visible nearby. Here the open

shrub swamp cosists largely of sedge/grass/forb meadow with Speckled

Alder ( <I>Alnus rugosa</I> ), Alder-leaved Buckthorn ( <I>Rhamnus

alnifolia </I>), Red Spruce, Balsam Fir ( <I>Abies balsamea </I>),

Yellow Birch and a few Black Ash ( <I>Fraxinus nigra </I>). The

Buckthorn then had numerous green berries and both it and the

Fir were heavily browsed by Deer, with the Fir showing a clear

browse line. A conspicuous feature were tall plants of an alien

Yellow Iris ( <I>Iris pseudocorus</I> ), which had evidently been

introduced in a misapplied effort to &quot;beautify&quot; the

natural habitat.

<P>

 Most striking among the sedges were tall culms of<I>

Carex crinita</I>. Also present were<I> C. stipata  </I>and the

Bulrush<I> Scirpus atrovirens</I>. Other common herbs were Broad-leaved

Cattail ( <I>Typha latifolia,</I>),White Hellebore (<I> Veratrum</I>

<I>viride </I>), Jewelweed (<I> Impatiens </I>sp ), Rough Bedstraw

(<I> Galium asprellum</I> ), Golden Ragwort, Fowl Managrass, Indian

Turnip, Sensitive Fern (<I> Onoclea sensibilis</I>) and a riotously-blooming

white-flowered stitchwort, identified as the alien Lesser Stitchwort

(<I> Stellaria graminea </I>) from its flowers. Another alien,

then also in bloom, was Sweet Vernal Grass (<I> Anthoxanthum odoratum</I>

), whose compact panicles seemed to protrude everywhere in openings.

An isolated clump of tall Reed Canary Grass (<I> Phalaris arundinacea

</I>) stood near the road and<I> Poas  </I>of various species,

whose identities would become clear later, were also part of the

scene. Of special interest was Glade Spurge (<I> Euphorbia purpurea

</I>) which seemed to thrive here and was in full bloom.

<P>

 Most of the species listed above are characteristic

of the eastern and interior part of the wetland. As will be discussed

later in more detail, this is likely a consequence of more alkaline

water associated with the stream and ground water in contact with

the Greenbrier Limestone. By contrast the far ( west ) side of

the wetland is under the influence of the acidic swamp forest

adjacent to it. There are found Haircap ( <I>Polytrichum</I> sp

) and Peat (<I> Sphagnum</I> sp ) mosses, Cinnamon Fern ( <I>Osmunda

cinnamomea </I>) and large patches of Northern Beech Fern ( <I>Phegopteris

connectilis</I> ). Also scattered throughout were hybrids of Crested

Shield Fern ( <I>Dryopteris cristata</I> ) and a Spinulose Shield

Fern as indicated by its spinulose pinnules. This may be <I>Dryopteris

boottii.</I> Intermediate Shield Fern was also common in the edge

zone and within the swamp forest.

<P>

 During the afternoon of 6-25-97 the traverse was

extended along the Deer Run Trail into the forest west of the

open shrub swamp. As indicated above, the swamp forest edge here,

which contains large patches of deep green Sphagnum, is more acid

than the shrub swamp. A little off the trail to the north, where

the swamp forest also borders an extention of the shrub swamp,

this relation is again shown by the restriction of Great Rhododendron

to the swamp edge under the forest canopy. By contrast the open

shrub swamp here contained no ericaceae or other acid-dependent

plants. It did however contain Mountain Maple ( <I>Acer spicatum</I>

), then in bloom, a number of vigorous, well-formed Black Ash,

a Meadowrue (<I> Thalictrum</I> sp ) and Marsh Purslane (<I> Ludwigia

palustris</I> ) as well as abundant grasses and sedges.

<P>

 Farther away from the open swamp edge the forest

ranges from swamp to upland type. A spot inventory yielded Red

Maple, Yellow Birch, Black Cherry, Hemlock, Red Spruce, Beech,

Great Rhododendron, Hay-scented and Intermediate Shield Ferns,

Canada Mayflower,<I> Carex debilis,</I> seedlings of Mountain

Ash ( <I>Pyrus americana</I> ) and<I> Dicranum</I>, <I>Polytrichum</I>

and<I> Hypnum</I> mosses. Moving farther into this forest along

the Deer Run Trail, large amounts of New York Fern were suddenly

encountered, and this was shortly followed by Bracken Fern (<I>

Pteridium aquilinum</I> ). Next,again attesting to the extreme

acidic character of this forest, there appeared large patches

of Common Clubmoss (<I> Lycopodium clavatum </I>) and Ground Pine

(<I> L. flabelliforme</I> ) intergrown with Haircap and <I>Leucobryum

</I>Mosses, Interrupted Fern ( <I>Osmunda clatoniana</I> ), Mountain

Ash seedlings and Partridge Berry (<I> Mitchella repens </I>).

<P>

 At this point a side trail led to an observation

platform that overlooks the same open shrub swamp noted earlier.

On approaching the platform the diversity of acid tolerant and

obligate plants seemed to increase. These included Bracken Fern,

extensive intergrowth of Peat and Haircap mosses, Striped Maple

<I>( Acer pensylvanicum </I>), Sourtop Blueberry (<I> Vaccinium

myrtilloides </I>), <I>Carex intumescens</I>, Mountain Ash, Ground

Berry (<I> Rubus hispidus </I>), the same club mosses mentioned

earlier and Star Violet ( <I>Dalibarda repens </I>). While the

latter was not in bloom on this visit, we were to see it in full

flower a month later. A spot inventory of a square meter at the

swamp edge, under trees and slanting north light,revealed Star

Violet, Partridge Berry, Canada Mayflower, Creeping Snowberry

(<I> Gaultheria hispidula </I>), Sourtop Blueberry, Ground Berry,Intermediate

Shield Fern,<I> Leucobryum </I>Moss and Mountain Ash seedlings,

all of which are acidiphiles and most markedly boreal.Although

not included, Spring Bluets (<I> Houstonia caerulia </I>) were

blooming elsewhere along the forest edge.

<P>

 While little attention was devoted to them, signs

of fauna included calls of the Hermit Thrush (<I> Catharus guttatus

</I>), a Song Sparrow (<I> Melopiza melodia</I> ) and a pair of

3/4 inch ( 2 cm ) brown Crane Flies mating. Also, at this same

location, on the previous evening, a large raptor, likely a Red

Shouldered Hawk (<I> Buteo lineatus </I>) was startled up from

the sedges not a hundred yards ( 100 meters) distant. Calls of

this species were also heard from time to time in the area.

<P>

 In what follows we will recount an inventory of

the swamp here done after a circuit from the west. This circuit

was made during the morning of both 6-25-97 and 7-31-97 and in

each instance began where the Abe Run Trail branches from the

Deer Run Trail and followed the former. Initially this trail also

crosses the open shrub swamp on a board walk but for a greater

distance than that of the Deer Run Trail. Here also the swamp

is dominated by Speckled Alder and sedge/grass/forb meadow with

Alder-leaved Buckthorn, Red Spruce, Balsam Fir, Yellow Birch and

scattered Black Ash. A little Winterberry Holly ( <I>Ilex verticillata

</I>) and Glade St. Johns-wort ( <I>Hypericum densiflorum</I>

) were noted as well. In one place, near the west end of the board

walk, there was a distinctive groundberry whose leaf shape and

&quot;hispid hairs and bristles intermixed,some of which bore

small terminal [ pink] glands &quot;fitted the description of

<I>Rubus davisiorum</I> ( Strausbaugh and Core,1978 ). As along

Deer Run Trail, the same alien Yellow Iris borders the small sluggish

stream near the swamp center. Glade Spurge is extraordinarily

abundant and vigorous and is confined to the swamp interior. However,

although vigerous-appearing in June, it was in July covered by

a pervasive white mold. Other herbs tallied on the 6-25-97 traverse

were the sedges <I>Carex crinita</I>,<I> C. lurida, C. incomperta,

</I>C. <I>canescens</I> and<I> Scirpus atrovirens</I>, White Hellebore,

Broad-leaved Cattail, Golden Ragwort, then in bloom, Wrinkle-leaf

Goldenrod ( <I>Solidago rugosa</I> ), Sensitive and Cinnamon Ferns,<I>

Dryopteris boottii,</I> Fowl Managrass, various unidentified grasses

and the aliens Velvet Grass (<I> Holcus lanatus </I>) and Sweet

Vernal Grass. A prize of this visit was a single plant of the

rare northern disjunct Purple Avens (<I> Geum rivale</I> ) in

the last stages of flowering.

<P>

 On crossing this same section of swamp on 7-31-97

we noted in succession the following: Golden Saxifrage (<I> Chrysosplenium

americanum </I>), <I>Carex prasina</I>, the managrass <I>Glyceria

melicaria</I>, Rough Bedstraw, the meadowrue <I>Thalictrum pubescens</I>,

Drooping Wood Reedgrass (<I> Cinna latifolia</I> ), Field Mint

(<I> Mentha arvensis </I>), then in bloom, and Great Bulrush (<I>

Scirpus validus </I>). Here we entered the area of abundant Glade

Spurge now covered by heavy white mold. This was accompanied by

Purple-stem Aster (<I> Aster puniceus</I> ), followed by a clump

of Common Milkweed (<I> Asclepius syriaca</I> ), which had attracted

several Monarch Butterflies (<I> Danaus plexippus</I> ). We now

had reached the stream which contained a lush growth of Small

Burreed ( <I>Sparganium chlorocarpum</I> ) and was bordered by

beautiful headed-out Fowl Bluegrass (<I> Poa palustris</I> ).

It was here also that we heard an overflight of Canada Geese (

<I>Branta canadensis</I> ) and saw a Chipping Sparrow(<I> Spizella</I>

<I>passerina </I>). These were followed by the rush <I>Juncus

brevicaudatis</I>  and the sedge<I> Carex echinata</I>, while

a Turkey Vulture (<I> Catharies avia </I>) soared above.

<P>

 As we approached the swamp edge and bordering forest

there was a dramatic change, with not markedly acidiphile or circumneutral

species replaced by acid lovers. Here<I> Sphagnum</I> in low spots

alternated with Haircap Moss (possibly <I>Polytrichum commune

</I>) on high hummocks and Grounberry ( <I>Rubus hispidus </I>)

was conspicuous.Spruce reproduction appeared to be quite vigorous

at the forest edge, but no Balsam Fir smaller than 3 inch ( 8

cm) dianeter saplings were to be seen and each Fir had a sharp

browse line at deer height visible across the swamp.

<P>

 The forest proper here is essentially swamp forest

dominated by Hemlock but with Red Spruce, Balsam Fir up to 10

inches ( 25centimeters) dbh or more, Yellow Birch, Red Maple and

on higher areas, Beech, Black Cherry and Sugar Maple. A little

Striped Maple and other small trees formed a rather sparse understory.

However large woody debris was common and in one place a good

example of a &quot;nurse tree&quot; was seen. In this instance

it was a large conifer, long fallen, upon which numerous other

trees had taken root. However there was little sign of reproduction

in the form of seedlings of any species, possibly a consequence

of the deep shade cast by the conifers. During the June passage

through this forest what sounded like a Solitary Vireo (<I> Vireo

solitarius</I>) was heard and in July a Hermit Thrush and a Black-throated

Blue Warbler (<I> Dendroica caerulescens </I>) attracted our attention.

<P>

 Continuing along the trail, which turns to the south,

we entered a more elevated area of largely mature hardwoods consisting

of Sugar and Red Maples, Beech, Yellow Birch and Black Cherry,

with some trees as large as 3 feet ( 90 cm )dbh. Then turning

again, this time eastward, we encountered outcrops of sandstone

and not only Intermediate Shield Fern but also, in close association,

the deciduous Spinulose Shield Fern<I> Dryopteris carthusian</I>a.

Where the forest was swampy, on our July traverse we found tussocks

of the northern sedge <I>Carex trisperma</I> as well as<I> C.

stipata,,</I> and nearby, the Small Green Wood Orchid ( <I>Habenaria

clavellata </I>), in bloom. We then came to the area with Star

Violet, also in bloom, and widely distributed along the previously-mentioned

 trail to the observation platform.

<P>

 Having once more arrived at the shrub swamp overlooked

by the observation tower, we conducted an inventory of the July

flora. The swamp, which evidently was the former site of a beaver

pond, occupied both sides of a small stream, presumably Abe Run.

At this site it is largely herb meadow, but with scattered Speckled

Alder, Alder-leaf Buckthorn and Balsam Fir. A little Hardhack

(<I> Spiraea tomentosa</I> ) was also seen. Sedges included<I>

Carex lurida</I>, <I>C.</I> <I>scoparius</I>, <I>Scirpus microcarpus</I>

 and Great Bulrush, with the latter  being decorated by small

spiders of a color shade matching the Bulrush'es brown spikes.

Other herbs observed here were <I>Juncus articulatus</I>, the

tall Fringed Bromegrass (<I> Bromus ciliatus </I>), Marsh Purslane,

a species of the liverwort <I>Scapania</I>, Sundrops (<I> Oenothera

perennans</I> ), then in bloom, abundant Broad-leaved Cattail,

Rough Avens (<I> Geum laciniatum</I> ), Flat-top White Aster (<I>

Aster</I> <I>umbellatus </I>), Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod, Grass-leaved

Goldenrod (<I> Euthamia graminifolia</I> ), Blue-eyed Grass (<I>

Sisyrinchium angustifolium</I> ) and abundant Common Milkweed

with Monarch Butterflies in attendance.

<P>

 As in many places in this Valley, we see a marked

contrast between the swamp and the adjacent forest flora with

respect to acid-adapted species. Here the contrast is particularly

striking between the circumneutral or alkali tolerant swamp species

and the strongly acidiphile plants such as Star Violet, Blueberries

and Canada Mayflower on the adjacent bank. Only contact with groundwater

in the case of the former and vertical rainwater leaching in the

case of the latter, can reconcile this contrast.

<h2>Middle Ridge Trail</h2>

<br>

<B>Source Walk: 7-30-97, afternoon, pleasant</B>

<P>

 Our traverse here began at the main Park road, descended

into a shallow ravine, extended north along the base of Middle

Ridge and finally crossed the end of this Ridge to Club Run for

a total length of somewhat more than a mile ( 1.6 km).What follows

is a sequential description of our inventory.

<P>

 Initially encountered near the road was a copse

of upland forest with a canopy of mature Yellow Birch, Beech,

Black Cherry, Red Maple and Hemlock, withj Striped Maple and Smooth

Serviceberry (<I> Amelanchier laevis </I>) as understory. Also

present was a holly of indefinite identity but likely Mountain

Holly (<I> Ilex montana </I>). Then descending through an opening,we

identified Cinnamon Fern, the Rush<I> Juncus biflorus</I>, Flat-top

White Aster, Grass-leaved Goldenrod and the Dewberry <I>Rubus

flagellatus</I>.

<P>

 At the bottom of the ravine the bed of a small stream

exposed a grayish tan sandstone. This rock was probably part of

the Mauch Chunk Group, as were other rocks encountered along the

traverse. It is likely that the contact with the underlying Greenbrier

Limestone lies near the base of the Ridge. The canopy in the ravine

was dominated by Hemlock with abundant Witch Hazel ( <I>Hamamelis

virginiana</I> ) in the shrub layer. Herbs concentrated in the

stream vicinity were Wood Nettle (<I> Laportea canadensis</I>

) and the mana grasses <I>Glyceria melicaria</I>  and<I> G. striata</I>.

Beyond the stream the trail climbed through a canopy of Hemlock,

Beech, Red Maple, Yellow Birch and the first and only ( very minor

) Black Birch seen by us. Only Striped Maple was seen in the understory.

Round-leaf Violet (<I> Viola rotundifolia </I>) Hay-scented Fern,

a  few plants of Beech Drops <I>( Epifagus virginiana </I>) and

a little of the fungus<I> Tylopilus felleus</I>  were present

in the ground cover. Some Beech here were more than a foot ( 0.3

meter ) dbh and exhibited fire scars. Perhaps related to this

fire were numerous associated small Beech saplings. It is worth

mentioning that Black Cherry comprised some of the largest trees

seen here and had the usual good form characteristic of the Alleghenies.

<P>

 Again moving along the trail we saw Indian Turnip,

White Wood Aster ( <I>Aster divaricatus </I>) and more sandstone,

which was now reddish in color. Although not seen before, we now

encountered a few Sugar Maple and White Ash, with  some of the

latter exceding 20 inches ( 50 cm) dbh and  possesed of a form

almost as straight and tall asthe Black Cherry. The latter as

well as the Beech continued abundant and were soon accompanied

by Ground Pine, New York Fern and <I>Carex intumescens </I> in

the ground layer. Here also we heard a Thrush singing in the distance.

<P>

 Where a large Black Cherry had fallen, a rich, reddish

mull type soil was exposed and accompanied by Intermediate Shield

Fern. A little beyond this tree we saw more Sugar Maple, Allegheny

Fly-back grass (<I> Danthonia compressa </I>), the forest grass<I>

Brachyelytrum erectum</I> and an isolated Red Spruce sapling about

6 feet ( 2 meters ) high; then more and abundant Beech with lesser

Cherry and Sugar Maple. Here also was more Round-leaf Violet,

a single Large Round-leaved Orchid (<I> Habenaria orbiculata </I>)

and a rather small, tan American Toad (<I> Bufo americanus </I>).

Continuing along the trail, which was really an old road, we noted

it to be fringed by Fowl Managrass and<I> Poa alsodes,</I> while

a few Halberd-leaf Violets (<I> Viola hastata </I>) grew in the

adjacent forest.

<P>

 It should be noted that the forest here was mature

and quite open with little underbrush, likely due to deer browsing.

Also not far off the trail stood a single large Tuliptree, perhaps

2 feet ( 0.6 meter) in diameter, of good form, and the only member

of its species seen by us in Canaan Valley during all our inventories

to date.

<P>

 Shortly after the Tuliptree,we began climbing to

a mild summit of the Ridge. noting<I> Carex gracillima </I>on

the way. On this slope we entered a markedly different and more

acidic habitat which intensified on the slope descending to Club

Run. The canopy consisted almost entirely of Red Maple, Beech

and Black Cherry with little undergrowth but a dense ground cover

of Tree Clubmoss ( <I>Lycopodium obscurum </I>) with Hay-scented

and New York Ferns. A likely related feature is a light, sandy

soil, tan in color, and because of its texture, dry on the trail,

throughout the area in which Club Moss prevails. This was unlike

most of the soils traversed earlier, which seeminly were more

clay-rich and consequently moister and darker in color.

<P>

 At the bottom of the &quot;Lycopod slope &quot;

we reached an open swamp or glade along Club Run, which, like

the other streams  visited, is a branch of the Blackwater River.

This glade. which may  also be in part Beaver meadow, appeared

to be dominated, at least here, by Meadowsweet (<I> Spiraea alba

</I>), but with abundant Glade St. Johns-wort, Sourtop Blueberry,<I>

Rubus hispidus</I>, Wild Raisin ( <I>Viburnum cassinoides </I>)

and , in the distance, near the stream, a few shrubs of Black

Elderberry (<I> Sambucus canadensis</I>), conspicuous in July

for its white blooms. The edge of the glade was in a sense a continuation

of the forest slope and consequently very acid. In addition to

the shrubs already mentioned, there were abundant Peat and Haircap

mosses, Crested and Bracken Ferns, Common Clubmoss ( <I>Lycopodium

clavatum</I> ), Hairgrass (<I> Agrostis hyemalis </I>), <I>Carex

lurida, C. folliculata</I>, <I>Juncus brevcaudatis,</I> Deertongue

Grass (<I> Panicum</I> <I>clandestinum </I>), Bog Goldenrod (<I>

Solidago uliginosa </I>), and Narrow-leaved Gentian (<I> Gentiana

linearis </I>). Birds seen were Common Yellowthroat ( <I>Geothlypis

trichas</I> ), Black-capped Chickadee (<I> Parus atricapillus</I>

) and Turkey Vulture.

<P>

 Additional fungi collected and identified by R.Hunsucker

on this traverse were the following;

<P>

<I> Mycena  </I>sp

<br>

 <I>Marasmius rotula</I>

<br>

 <I>Russula </I>sp

<br>

 <I>Lactarius  </I>sp

<h2>Blackwater River Trail</h2>



 

<br>

<B>Source Walks:6-26-97, 7-29-97 and 7-30-97</B>

<P>

 We need only review our photographs to experience

again the Blackwater glades. Their spectrum of colors is broad

and always changing-in a matter of weeks from blue-green to gold-streaked-in

a harmonious blend of alder swamp, copse of Balsam Fir and waving

Blue Joint Grass meadow. Their sweeping vistas are among the most

inspiring in the Central Appalachians. Though recovered now to

only a semblance of their pristine state, these wetlands of a

different time still raise our expectations. The stretch to brooding

Canaan Mounain in a wilderness that is each year growing wilder,

that may conceal species only now returning after a century's

devastation and human meddling.

<P>

 Vital to the health of the glades is the enveloping

upland forest. While Canaan Mountain on the northwest seems secure,

the thin buffer strip of northern hardwoods on the southeast is

hardly sufficient to protect the wetland from a monstrous golf

course that lies in that direction. This circumstance is all-the-more

significant because the entire area is underlain by Greenbrier

Limestone,through which subterranian solution channels may facilitate

the transport of herbicides and other chemicals to the glades.

<P>

 The Blackwater Trail itself is a 3/4 mile ( 1.2

km) circuit through upland forest but passes near the River  plain

and glades in its middle section. Elevations vary only from 3270

feet ( 997 meters ) at the start to 3240 feet ( 988 meters ) near

the River. The rapid transit of 6-26-97, made under threatening

rain clouds, was in the nature of a econnaissance, with seasonally

significant observations of some of the flora. Our traverse on

the afternoon of 7-24-97 included inventories along the first

part of the trail and a spot inventory of the glades, while that

of 7-30-97 covered the remainder of the trail. Both of the July

traverses were done under idyllic weather conditions. 

<P>

 The trail begins inauspiciously at the golf course

parking lot in an open field. During our July visit we did a rapid

inventory of this open area under sunny afternoon skies. Ground

cover here was dominated by the most luxuriant growth of Allegheny

Fly-back Grass ever seen by this observer. Other grasses noted

were Autumn Bent (<I> Agrostis perennans </I>), another Bent,

<I>Agrostis giganteus</I>, Deertongue Grass and a beautiful stand

of Fringed Brome, which we were also to see along Abe Run. An

additional species also present in June both here and in the Deer

Run/Abe Run Swamp, was Sweet Vernal Grass.

<P>

 Large, Vigorous Dotted Thorn (<I> Crataegus punctata</I>)

and patches of tall Common Milkweed perfuming the air marked the

transiton to forest. The Milkweed was being patronized by large

numbers of Monarch Butterflies and by Ruby-throated Hummingbirds

( <I>Archilochus colubus </I>) with as many as four of these birds

at a time perched on Dotted Thorn limbs above the Milkweed while

others worked the blossoms. Accompanying were other butterflies,

including large and small fritillaries ( <I>Speyeria  </I>sp and

<I>Bolaria  </I>sp ), Spring Azure ( <I>Lycoenopsis argiolus pseudargiolus

</I>) and Wood Nymphs <I>( Cercyanis</I>  sp ).

<P>

 The forest canopy here was mature with some large

trees. While a minor component, Red Maples were some of the largest

trees, ranging up to 30 inches ( 76 cm )dbh. The dominant species

however, was Sugar Maple, with Beech and Black Cherry also abundant

and a fair amount of large, straight White Ash in places. Yellow

Birch appeared to become more common toward the River and in places

was joined by Hemlock and greater concentrations of Red Maple.

<P>

 This forest was very open, with little or no understory

or shrub layers. Most tree seedlings appeared to be Sugar Maple

but  Beech sprouts and/or seedlings were also common. The ground

flora also appeared to lack diversity and was discontinuous. In

June it was dominated by ferns, sedges and grasses. Prominent

among these were New York Fern. <I>Carex debilis  </I>and<I> Poa

alsodes</I>, with lesser quantities of <I>Carex intumescens</I>,<I>

C. normalis, C. swanii</I>  and <I>Brachyelytrum erectum.  </I>There

was also scattered Cinnamon and Hay-scented Ferns nearer the River.



<P>

 After traversing a stretch of this upland forest,

the trail entered another open, grassy slope on which in July

we encountered tall, brilliantly blue-flowered Blue Vervain (<I>

Verbena hastata </I>), Pasture Thistle ( <I>Cirsium pumilum </I>)

in bloom, another thistle (<I> Cirsium</I> sp ), Indian Tobacco

(<I> Lobelia inflata </I>) and the aliens Smooth Hawkbeard (<I>

Crepis capillaris </I>) and Long-stalked Cranes-bill ( <I>Geranium

columbinum</I> ), also in bloom. Here too was a single bush of

Roughish Arrowwood (<I> Viburnum dentatum </I>), which was blooming

in June. Curiously for this grassy slope, which did not seem particulrily

acidic, there were several small patches of the characteristcally

acid-soil species<I> Rubus hispidus</I>  and Sourtop Blueberry.

<P>

 Birds seen or heard along this section of the trail

were Red-eyed Vireos, Chipping Sparrows, and in the distance,

over the glades, Canada Geese.

<P>

 After passing through a short stretch of essentially

Sugar Maple forest with outcrops of limestone, a little Great

Rhododendron, Intermediate Shield Fern and possible <I>Dryopteris

carthusiana</I>, a side branch of the trail led to a &quot;station

3 &quot; on the edge of the River and glades.Here, despite the

underlying limestone, the vegetation just above the River was

decidedly acidic in character. Growing here in the semi-open at

the forest edge, were Great Rhododendron, Sourtop Blueberry, Hay-scented

and Bracken Ferns, White Wood Sorrel, Haircap and other mosses.

Only a matter of feet to the north, covering the River bank and

extending to the distant line of Speckled Alder thickets, was

the tall grass/ sedge meadow dominated by Bluejoint ( <I>Calamagrostis

canadensis </I>) grass. Here on the June visit all had been blue-green,

but in late July multicolored with golden heads of Bluejoint and

other grasses maturing. Grasses other than Bluejoint in July were

Reed Canary Grass, Fowl   Bluegrass, Virginia Wild Rye(<I> Elymus

virginicus </I>), Rice Cutgrass, The mana grasses<I> Glyceria

striata, G. melicaria,</I> and in particular, tall open-panicled

<I>C.</I> <I>grandis</I>. Sedges were represented by <I> Carex

tribuloides, C.</I> <I>lurida, C. vulpioidea, C. tenera, C. scapania</I>,

the southern coastal<I> C.</I> <I>hyalineolepis,</I> <I>Scirpus

cyperinus</I>, Great Bulrush, <I>Eleocharis obtusa</I> and <I>E</I>.

<I>palustris;</I> the rushes by <I>Juncus effusus</I>  and <I>J.

acuminatus</I>. Associated with these were Blue Vervain, here,

as on the upland, in bloom, Field Mint, Tear-thumb Vine, Common

Monkey Flower (<I> Mimulus ringens </I>), also in bloom, Elliptic-leaf

St. Johns-wort (<I> Hypericum ellipticum</I> ), Small-flowered

St. Johns-wort (<I> H. mutlum</I> ), Clayton' s Bedstraw (<I>

Galium tinctorium</I> ), Rough Bedstraw, Sweet-scented Indian

Plantain (<I> Cacalia suaviolens </I>), Rough Cinquefoil ( <I>Potentilla

norvegica</I> ), Mad-dog Skulcap (<I> Scutellaria lateriflora</I>

) and Sensitive Fern. Small Burreed was seen in the River itself.

Woody plants included Meadowsweet, Balsam Fir, Hemlock, Red Spruce,

Speckled Alder, a little browsed-down Roughish Arrowwood, Swamp

Rose (<I> Rosa palustris </I>), also browsed, and a little a little

Red Raspberry ( <I>Rubus strigosus </I>).

</center><p>

 Birds seen in July were Song Sparrow, Cedar Waxwing

(<I> Bombycilla cedrorum </I>) and an Eastern Kingbird (<I> Tyranus

tyranus </I>). Small lepidoptera similar to those seen in other,

including calcareous, wetlands, were common and were accompnied

by an unusual 3/4 inch ( 2 cm ) very dark, almost black opaque-winged

member of that order with orange foreparts. Fish also were seen

in the stream, which had a more substantial current than on the

June visit.

<P>

 A measurement of a soil sample from the River bank

top among Bluejoint grass yielded pH=5.6, which, if correct, indicted

sustantial leaching here also.

<P>

 West of &quot;station3&quot; the trail parallels

the edge of the glade but remains within the upland forest. On

the rapid transit of 6-26-97 the following species and terrain

features were succesively noted: Initially seen were<I> Poa alsodes,</I>

<I>Carex intumescens</I>, <I>C. gracillima</I>, Bottlebrush Grass

( <I>Hystrix patula </I>) beginning to head out, White Hellebore,<I>

Carex laxiflora,</I> Sweet-scented Bedstraw with unusually large

leaves, White Snakeroot, White Baneberry ( <I>Actaea pachypoda

</I>), Intermediate Shield fern, a single plant of Goldies Shield

Fern ( <I>Dryopteris goldiana </I>), a live land snail and White

Wood Sorrel. Noted also was the dark organic soil on the slope

and between protrusions of the light bluish-gray limestone. Next

observed were Hemlock and Great Rhododendron with concentrations

of Red Maple seedlings at their edges. The Rhododendron was also

observed growing between limestone protrusions, which showed pronounced

evidence of dissolution by their rounded forms and channeled surfaces.

These observations were followed by the call of a Red-shouldered

Hawk over the glades, a single plant of Christmas Fern (<I> Polystichum

acrostichoides</I> ), abundant <I>Scirpus atrovirens </I>in the

trail, Indian Turnip, a large patch of Common Clubmoss and Stiff

Clubmoss (<I> Lycopodium annotinum</I> ) under a large Red Maple,

a bush of Ninebark (<I> Physocarpus opulifolius</I> ) in bloom,

a Red Squirrel (<I> Tamiasciurus hudsonicus </I>), a nine inch

( 23 cm ) dbh Hophornbeam (<I> Ostrya virginiana </I>) and a very

large Interrupted Fern plant.

<P>

 On the morning of 7-30-97 we repeated the traverse

west from &quot;station 3&quot;. However this time we tallied

species on both sides of the forest-glade ecotone. Beginning at

the glade edge, we identified Spreading Dogbane ( <I>Apocynum

androsaemifolium </I>), Drooping Wood Reed Grass and Rattlesnake

Managrass ( either<I> Glyceria canadensis  </I>or <I>G. laxa</I>

) and in the stream, Duck Potato or Wapato ( <I>Sagittaria latifolia

</I>) in bloom. We also again noted Great Rhododendron concentrated

at the forest edge despite the close proximity of limestone. A

soil sample taken at the base of a  Rhododendron just above limestone

had a pH of 6.0, seemingly indicating a higher alkali tolerance

of this plant than anticipated. As is usual for this shrub, this

soil had a high content of organic matter.

<P>

 Next recorded on the acidic forest soil were Partridge

Berry in association with Great Rhododendron, Miterwort ( <I>Mitella

diphylla</I> ), Lady Fern (<I> Athyrium filix-femina </I>), Northern

Beech Fern, White Wood Sorrel and species of<I> Bazzania</I> 

and<I> Polytrichum</I>. However, growing directly on a limestone

block were Alpine Enchanters Nightshade (<I> Circaea alpina </I>),

species of <I> Anomodon</I>,<I> Fissidens  </I>and<I> Brachythecium</I>

mosses and Delicate Fern Moss  <I>( Thuidium delicatulum</I> ).

These were followed by Nodding Fescue, Crooked-stem Aster (<I>

Aster prenanthoides </I>), then at the stream edge, by Larger

Starwort, Floating Pondweed (<I> Potamageton epihydrus</I> ) and

submerged <I>Sphaganium</I>. On the bank moist areas were American

Water-pennywort ( <I>Hydrocotyle americana </I>), Clammy Hedge-hyssop

(<I> Gratiola neglecta </I>) and a Beggar Tick (<I> Bidens </I>sp

).

<P>

 We now entered a part of the adjacent forest where

Hemlock and Red Maple were more abundant and seemigly related

to deeper soil cover over the limestone. Associated with the Maple

in particular were seedlings of Mountain Ash and Mountain Holly.

Then at the River's edge again we observed the meadowrue<I> Thalictrum

pubescens</I>. the moss <I>Aulacomnium palustre,</I> Marsh Yellow

Cress (<I> Rorippa palustris </I>) and Cowbane, all on moist soil.

<P>

 The adjacent upland forest had now become even more

acidic. Hemlock, Red Maple, Great Rhododendron, Northern Sweet

Violet (<I> Viola blanda </I>), Partridge Berry and patches of<I>

Leucobryum  </I>moss were common. Subsequently we arrived at the

area of large patches of Common and Stiff Clubmosses under the

large Red Maple that we had encountered on the 6-26-97 traverse.

A short foray here to the River bank revealed blooming Tall Coneflower

(<I>Rudbecia laciniata</I> ) and Common Milkweed with Hummingbirds

on the latter. Also seen were a few bushes of a willow, likely

the alien Crack Willow (<I> Salix fragilis </I>). Tree Swallows

( <I>Iridoprocne bicolor</I> ) were active over the glades.

<P>

 A further point of interest was the presence of

what appeared to be, at least from a distance, of scattered Red

Maple in the glades. Apparently located on local elevations, they

 likely were benefitting from leached and acidfied soil in such

places.

<P>

 Although our inventory ended here, where the trail

turned away from the glades, a final observation along the southward-trending

section was of several very large Bigtooth Aspen (<I> Populus

grandidentata </I>) which opportunistically occupied the forest

edge.

<P>

 

<h2>Summary</h2>

<P>

 

<P>

 The overall impression of the upland forests gained

from the foregoing inventories is one of low vascular plant diversity,

especially with respect to woody plants. Furthermore, there appears

to be little difference in diversity between carbonate and non-carbonate

terrain except for the greater abundance of some species such

as Sugar Maple and White Ash in the former and Red Maple in the

latter. Canopy trees regularily encountered numbered only eight

species with understory and shrub species even fewer in number.

In contrast, a dry, ericaceous oak forest at moderate elevations

at Hoop Hole in Virginia's Valley and Ridge had a minimum of 38

woody species with 18 reaching canopy size. Rich mesic limestone

areas such as at Blowing Springs, also in the Valley and Ridge,

may have 400 or more vascular plants, including over 70 woody

species in a relatively small area.

<P>

 Fortney ( 1975 ) reported 523 species of vascular

plants for the entire Canaan Valley, a total, which was recently

updated to 580 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Certainly

the brief inventories reported here missed many species that would

have been seen in a more comprehensive effort. These include such

rare disjuncts as Cranberry Tree (<I> Viburnum trilobum </I>),

Jacob's Ladder ( <I>Polemonium van-bruntae </I>) and Swamp Saxifrage

(<I> Saxifraga pensylvanica </I>), all of which have been reported

in areas inventoried by us.

<P>

  The lack of diversity in trees and shrubs of the

upland forests is likely a consequence of the exclusion of many

species by climatic conditions such as the short growing season,

which corresponds to that of northern New England and adjacent

Canada. However, no examples of the most diverse of tree habitats,

the steep colluvial slope, were inventoried by us here. The accompanying

relatively low diversity among herbs in limestone areas is more

difficult to explain since there are many forest herbs that are

adapted to these climatic conditions. It may simply reflect our

less than comprehensive surveys.<BR>
