<h2>General</h2>

<ul>
<p> Cathedral
State Park is a 133 acre (54 ha) remnant of ancient primary forest in West
Virginia's Allegheny Mountain sub-province. Elevations in the Park range from
2410 to 2620 feet (735 to 799 m) asl, but Shaffer Mountain rises to 3236 feet
 (987 m) within two miles. Drainage is by branches of Rhine Creek, a branch of
the Youghiogheny River, a part of the Ohio system. Underlying rock is probably
entirely Mississippian Pocono Formation, which appears to be dominantly
siliceous conglomeratic sandstone where exposed. Mississippian Greenbrier
limestone overlies the Pocono immediately to the north, where it is
characterized by open farmland. Devonian Hampshire Formation, which is also
composed largely of siliceous rocks, underlies part of the drainage to the
south  (Cardwell <i>et al</i>, 1968) .
Rocks appear to be gently dipping for the most part. However they are not well
exposed in most of the Park.
<p> The climate
is humid continental and the region falls within the area of the cloudy day
maximum of the eastern US (Reifsnyder and Lull, 1960)  . Thus, cloud cover may contribute substantially to the
microclimate. Normal daily average temperature in the general region for June
is near 65 deg F (18.3 deg C)   (National Climatic Data Center, 1966), which
is similar to that of parts of inland New England. However the relatively high
elevation of the Park, and its position in a valley in proximity to higher
elevations, make it susceptible to additional cool air accumulation.
<p> The
Cathedral Forest was studied in some detail by Bieri and Anliot (1965), who
gave most attention to canopy species. They identified several different
communities: Hemlock – Rhododendron, Hemlock – Fern, Hemlock – Duff and Maple –
Cherry – Birch. Their determinations of dbh and basal area frequencies of
Hemlock demonstrated the abundance of young, small diameter trees and the
prominence of veterans in the dbh range of 40 inches (one m) or more. Also of
considerable interest was their measurement of forest interior light
intensities, which were found to be only 3.6% of those in an adjacent open
field. 
<p> Because
this remnant tract of primary forest is so small and is cut by a major highway
 (US 50), it has been subject to some damaging intrusions. While some of these
are related to the highway and surrounding farming operations, others are also
result from well – intentioned but misguided management which makes use of
limestone gravel on paths and drainways. Also, while the Hemlock Wooly Adelgid
has apparently not made an incursion here as yet, it is a constant threat from
the east.
<p> It is also
of interest to compare the Cathedral Forest with similar but larger tracts on
the Allegheny Plateau of Pennsylvania. Perhaps most intensively studied of
these was that on East Tionesta Creek (Hough, 1936; Hough and Forbes, 1943) .
While these occurrences lie about 150 miles (240 km) north of Cathedral,
regional temperatures in the two regions apparently do not differ greatly,
since Appalachian isotherms tend to run north – south rather than east – west.
Thus the average annual temperatures in both regions fall in the range of 48
deg F (8.8 deg C) . This similarity also appears to apply to average annual
precipitation, which in both regions falls in the range of 45 inches (114 cm) 
 (Hough and Forbes, 1943) . As a result of the elevation and the previously
mentioned topographic conditions, Cathedral may actually be a bit cooler than
the Pennsylvania occurrences. An additional parallel between Cathedral and the
latter is the dominant presence of siliceous rocks underlying both occurrences
 (see references) . While cursory in nature, inventories reported here do
present some material not previously investigated. This includes bryophytes in particular, but also a very
limited survey of the fungi.
<p> Inventories
of Cathedral Park were conducted on 7-14-96, 9-22-98, 7-10-01 and 7-11-01. The
first two of these were brief and in the nature of reconnaissance . During the last two inventories, particular
attention was given to various substrates, the association of plants,
particularly bryophytes, with these substrates, and the frequencies of bryophyte species in various habitats.
Soil temperatures and pH values were also determined at a few stations.

<h2>Source walk: 7-14-96 </h2>
<ul>
<p> Our first
impression of the Cathedral Forest
on this day, during the height of summer's activity, was one of extraordinary
odor, humidity and coolness, reflecting the tall Canada hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>) canopy, the abundance of
decaying down wood, fungi, mosses and liverworts. Songs of the Wood Thrush (<i> Hylocichla 
mustelina </i>) were unusually
common, as were the sounds and sightings of Scarlet Tanager  (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>), Red-eyed Vireo  (<i>Vireo olivaceus </i>), possible Solitary Vireo  (<i>V. 
solitarius </i>), Rufus-sided
Towhee  (<i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus</i>)  and others, including unidentified
warblers. Fish up to six inches  (15 cm
) in length were seen in Rhine Creek.
<p> While
dominated by stately Hemlock, the canopy also included large White and Northern
Red Oaks (<i>Quercus alba</i> and <i>Q. rubra </i>) and Black Cherry (<i> Prunus serotina </i>), as well as smaller Yellow and Black
Birches (<i> Betula allegheniensis </i> and <i>B. 
lenta </i>), American Beech
  (<i>Fagus grandifolia </i>), Red
and Sugar Maples (<i> Acer rubrum </i>and <i>A</i>. <i>saccharum </i>), Cucumbertree  (<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>),  Tuliptree  (<i>Liriodendron tulipifera </i>) and White Ash (<i> Fraxinus americana </i>) . A single Yellow Buckeye  (<i>Aesculus 
octandra</i>)  was seen.
Understory trees noted were Striped Maple 
(<i>Acer pensylvanicus </i>) and Mountain Ash (<i> Sorbus 
americana</i>)  . Other small
trees or shrubs included Mountain Holly (<i> Ilex montana </i>), abundant Great Rhododendron  (<i>Rhododendron maximum </i>), some
Mountain Laurel  (<i>Kalmia latifolia </i>), Witch Hazel  (<i>Hamamelis virginiana </i>), and, in moist areas, Winterberry Holly (<i> Ilex 
verticillata</i>),  Arrowwood
Viburnum  (<i>Viburnum dentatum </i>) and Black Elderberry  (<i>Sambucus
 canadensis</i>)  . Quite abundant also, in moist, open areas
near the stream, was a large-caned blackberry with a few straight spines (later
identified as <i>Rubus pensilvanicus</i>) .
Alternate-leaved Dogwood  (<i>Cornus 
alternifolia </i>) and a little
hawthorn (<i> Crataegus </i> sp)  
were observed at the edge of the tract, while the acidiphile Groundberry  (<i>Rubus hispidus</i>) was common in moist areas. Although reported as
present by Bieri and Anliot (1965), Red Elderbery  (<i>Sambucus pubens </i>) was not recorded by us in any of our
inventories thus far.
<p> An
impression was also gained on this first visit that a considerable part of the
upland under Hemlock had ground cover dominated by either Intermediate Shield
Fern  (<i>Dryopteris intermedia </i>), White Wood Sorrel  (<i>Oxalis 
montana </i>) or Canada
Mayflower  (<i>Maianthemum canadense </i>), with associated Hay-scented Fern  (<i>Dennstaedtia</i> <i>punctilobula</i>),  New York Fern  (<i>Thelypteris 
noveboracensis </i>), Ground
Pine  (<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>),  Indian Cucumberroot  (<i>Medeola virginiana </i>) and, although least conspicuous, very common Partridge Berry
  (<i>Mitchella repens </i>) . Also seen was a little Wild Sarsaparilla  (<i>Aralia 
nudicaulis</i>),  scattered
trillium, likely <i>Trillium undulatum </i>  (Painted Trillium),  Mountain Oat Grass  (<i>Danthonia compressa </i>) common along trails, Sweet-scented Bedstraw  (<i>Galium 
triflorum </i>), White Wood
Aster  (<i>Aster divaricatus </i>), Indian Turnip  (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>),  an unidentified Sanicle (
<i>Sanicula</i> sp),  Honewort  (<i>Cryptotaenia 
canadensis </i>), Shining
Clubmoss  (<i>Lycopodium lucidulum</i>)  and the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>. Common Greenbrier (<i> Smilax rotundifolia</i>)  was one of the few vines seen. Although
Bieri and Anliot (1965) reported that Alpine Enchanter's Nightshade (<i>Circaea alpina </i>) was an important constituent of the flora, we have, curiously,
no record of this herb in any of our inventories!
<p> Moist areas
of the forest along the stream were characterized by abundant Crooked-stem
Aster  (<i>Aster prenanthoides </i>), Wood Nettle (<i> Laportea canadensis </i>), an unidentified meadowrue (<i> Thalictrum </i> sp),  Interrupted Fern
  (<i>Osmunda claytoniana </i>), Skunk
Cabbage  (<i>Symplocarpus foetidus </i>), Tall Coneflower  (<i>Rudbeckia laciniata</i>),  Common Joe-pye Weed (<i> Eupatorium fistulosum </i>), Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed  (<i>E</i>. 
<i>purpureum </i>), Clearweed
  (<i>Pilea pumila </i>), American
Water-pennywort  (<i>Hydrocotyle americana </i>), the alien Forget-me-not (<i> Myosotis scorpioides</i>)  in bloom, Northern Bugleweed (<i> Lycopus 
uniflorus </i>), Fowl Mannagrass
  (<i>Glyceria striata </i>), the
mannagrass <i>G. melicaria,</i> the
bulrush <i>Scirpus atrovirens</i> and
the sedge <i>Carex folliculata.</i> As
we shall see, some of these herbs, such as Honewort and Wood Nettle in
particular, may in some places be related to human-related soil enrichment.
<p> An unusual
species in a few moist areas was Star Violet (
<i>Dalibarda repens </i>), also in bloom, and in association with
other acidiphiles such as Partridge Berry, White Wood Sorrel and Ground Berry.
According to Strausbaugh and Core (
1977), the equally rare Lesser Rattlesnake Plantain (<i> Goodyera 
repens </i>) also occurs in the
Park, although it was not seen by us. Also, Bieri and Anliot (1965) report
Speckled Alder  (<i>Alnus rugosa</i> 
) as present. Additionally, Venable (undated) has Dwarf Cornel  (<i>Cornus</i> <i>canadensis </i>) as part of the flora. While this reporter is unaware of any
other record of this plant, its
presence would not be in conflict with this habitat.
<p> Among
bryophytes tentatively identified on this first visit were a haircap moss
  (<i>Poltrichum </i> sp)  
and the liverwort <i>Bazzania trilobata</i>.
A fuller treatment is provided later.

<h2>Source Walk: 9-22-98</h2>
<ul>
<p>Our
brief inventory on this day began under threat of showers that are so much a
part of this region.
<p> We entered
the trail system at the west end of the parking lot with initial observations
of fungi that included the deadly <i>Paxillus 
involutus</i>, <i>Xeromphalina</i> 
<i>campanella</i> under decaying Hemlock, an unidentified <i>Russula</i>
and <i>Marasmiellus opacus</i>. On
moving west along the Cathedral Trail, we noted a very large White Oak and a
species of the fungus <i>Cordyceps</i>, likely <i>C. militaris</i>, a common predator of larvae and pupae of
butterflies and moths (Phillips, 1991) . We were then surprised by the
unseasonable call of a Spring Peeper  (<i>Pseudacris crucifer </i>) from a nearby seep and noted unidentified species of the mosses<i>
Hypnum </i>and <i>Dicranum</i> on soil.
<p> We now made
a right turn, still on the Cathedral Trail, and observed a few one foot (0.3 m) dbh dead, but still standing, Pitch Pine (<i>Pinus rigida </i>) that probably once occupied an opening in
the dominantly Hemlock forest, and in which fast growing hardwoods eventually
shaded them out.
<p> Continuing
under threatening skies, we observed in succession the fungi <i>Amanita citrina</i>, with characteristic raw
potato odor, and <i>Trichaptum biforme</i>;
<p> then numerous
seedlings of Hemlock and some of Red Maple as well; followed by the Honey
Mushroom  (<i>Armillariella mellea </i>), and numerous small Hemlock saplings.
<p> Now,
arriving at a seep area, we noted Arrowwood Viburnum, the rush <i>Juncus</i> <i>effusus</i>, the bulrush<i>Scirpus atrovirens</i>, the sedge <i>Carex folliculata</i> and Fowl Manna Grass, most
of which had been observed in our inventory of 7-14-96. Here we again saw
several standing but dead, Pitch Pine with bark still adhering, and nearby, the
Hawthorn <i>Crataegus flabellate</i>.
Delicate Fern Moss  (<i>Thuiddium delicatulum</i>)  appeared to be common on tree bases and unidentified species of
the mosses<i>Fissidens </i>and <i>Brachythecium</i> were noted as well. These
were followed by a large patch of Tree Clubmoss  (<i>Lycopodium obscurum
</i>) .
<p> Here we
reached a trail junction, with the Cathedral Trail leading to the left and the
Partridge Berry Trail to the right. The trail junction was marked by an
uprooted tree with a rootwad that was comprised in part of a tan-colored sandy
loam with little or no incorporated organic matter. As we continued along the
Cathedral Trail, which here paralleled a branch of Rhine Creek, we observed the
edible Deer Mushroom (<i> Pluteus cervinus </i>) and heard the calls of the American Crow  (<i>Corvus 
brachyrhynchos </i>) . Then,
approaching another stream crossing, we became aware of the heavy undergrowth
that bordered the stream here in the more available light, and which consisted
largely of Great Rhododendron, but also of abundant large canes of Pennsylvania
Blackberry. Also noted was the fungus<i>Trogia crispa</i>. This was soon followed by another stream crossing;
then the edible fungus &quot;Angelwings&quot;  (<i>Pleurocybella 
porrigens </i>), a
characteristic species on decaying conifer wood.
<p> After yet
another stream crossing, we came to the junction with the Giant Hemlock Trail,
which we began to follow. Noted initially along this trail were fungi that
included an unidentified <i>Collybia</i> and <i>Mycena galericulata</i>; then a large patch of 10
to 20 foot (3 to 6 m)  -tall Hemlock
saplings. These were followed by a fungus of the genus <i>Pholiota</i> and tiny
seedlings of Hemlock and birch on a down bole that appeared to be covered on
top by an unidentified species of the moss <i>Hypnum </i>and, on its side, by
the leafy liverwort <i>Bazzania 
trilobata. </i>Next seen was the fungus <i>Fomintopsis pinicola </i>on dead conifer wood; then a large dead Hemlock with a heavy growth
of the edible but virulent parasitic Honey Mushroom - also noted earlier
elsewhere- on its roots. Our traverse was terminated prematurely here because
of a downpour. 
<p> An
impression was gained on this visit, after observation of many moss patches,
that species of <i>Hypnum</i> were disposed to occupy horizontal surfaces on
down boles, rock and soil, while <i>Thuiddium 
delicatulum</i> occupied tree bases. However, subsequent microscopic
studies by R. Hunsucker on species collected during 7-01, showed that a species
similar in appearance to <i>Hypnum</i>, namely <i>Brotherella recurvans</i>, appears to be an important
species at Cathedral and may have been misidentified by this reporter.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul>
<h2>Source walks: 7-10-01 and 7-11-01</h2>
<ul>
<p> Our
traverse of 7-10-01 began early in the
morning at the parking lot and proceeded west along the Cathedral Trail, as on
our earlier visit. Weather was sunny, warm and humid. First experienced was the
song of a Scarlet Tanager. Then we once again tallied canopy trees, the large
Hemlock, Northern Red and White Oaks and Black Cherry, with smaller Yellow and
Black Birches, Red Maple, Beech and a few Tuliptree, Cucumbertree and Sugar
Maple. Unlike an early visit, White Ash-doubtless fortuitously - was not seen and Sugar Maple appeared very
uncommon. However, the low soil pH values obtained by us in later inventories,
indicate that habitat for White Ash may be very limited in areas inventoried by
us and the pH values of the more acid soil enclaves may even lie outside of the
stability field of Sugar maple (Mueller,2000) . A thin leaf mat consisted
mostly of last season's Red and White Oak leaves and covered what appeared to
be a mor type soil.
<p> Numbered
samples of bryophytes, soil temperatures and soils were taken at intervals
along this and a subsequent traverse, An attempt was made to collect the
bryophytes, which were identified by R. Hunsucker under the microscope, from a
variety of habitats and substrates as described in what follows. Soil
temperatures were taken from a depth of five inches (13 cm) and soil samples
from a depth of 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) at selected locations. These depths were
chosen as they were deemed both most accessible and significant, as they
fall in the high density feeder root
zone of plants and in the case of temperature, deep enough to be screened from
superficial variations.
<p>In the text liverworts (Hicks, 1992) are distinguished
from mosses by the following sign <i>(Li)</i>.
<p> The first
bryophyte sample (#1) was taken from the base of a large White Oak up to a
height of 5 feet (1.5 m) and yielded the following species:
<p><i>Anomodon 
attenuatus</i>, <i>Campylium 
chrysophyllum</i>, <i>Cololejeunea 
biddlecomiae</i> (Li)
<p><i>Ctenidium 
molluscum</i>, <i>Fissidens adianthoides,</i>
<i>Lejeunea cavifolia</i> (Li),<i> Mnium cuspidatum</i>, <i>Neckera pennata</i>.
<p> As a consequence of the deep shade, little difference was
noted in the bryophyte cover on different sides of the trunk.
<p> A soil temperature reading (T-131) gave T=17.0 deg C. A
soil sample (!) was taken from a grayish, organic clay with some organic matter
beneath a two-inch (5 cm) mor layer. An initial pH value for this sample was
4.0, but 24 hours later this had decreased to 3.7, indicating very acid
material indeed.
<p> The ground flora was sparse beneath the large White Oak,
but included Canada Mayflower, Indian Cucumber-root, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, a
little jewelweed (<i>Impatiens</i> sp)  
and, of great interest, several plants of the Long-bracted Green Orchis  (<i>Habenaria viridis</i>),  a
northern species which was not yet in bloom, but bore flower buds.
<p> The second bryophyte sample (#2) was taken from down wood
on the forest floor. Found were:
<p><i>Brachythecium</i> sp, <i>Chiloscyphus profundus</i> (Li), <i>Hypnum curvifolium</i>, <i>Mnium cuspidatum</i>, <i>Mnium 
punctatum</i>, <i>Nowellia curvifolia</i>
(Li), <i>Odontoschisma denudatum</i> (Li),
<i>Pellia epiphylla </i>(Li), <i>Pellia</i> sp (
sterile) (Li), <i>Rhynchostegium 
serrulatum</i>, <i>Tetraphis pellucida</i>,
<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>.
<p> Our third bryophyte sample (#3) was taken from a
mature Beech up to a height of 5 feet. It bore the following:
<p><i>Brotherella recurvans</i>, <i>Brotherella tenuirostris</i>, <i>Campylium 
hispidulum</i>, <i>Chiloscyphus 
profundus</i> (Li), <i>Entodon 
brevisetus</i>, <i>Frullania asagrayana</i>
(Li), <i>Plagiothecium laetum</i>,
<i>Trichocolea tomentella</i> (Li).
<p> A little beyond this Beech we saw numerous saplings
of Hemlock, White Baneberry (<i>Actaea 
pachypoda</i>)  and White Snakeroot  (<i>Eupatorium rugosum</i>) We were next attracted to a 30 inch
 (0.76 m) dbh Hemlock, which apparently bore but few bryophytes. In our sample
(#4), taken from this tree, were:
<p><i>Bazzania trilobata</i>
(Li), <i>Hypnum curvifolium</i>,
<i>Plagiothecium laetum</i>, <i>Pottiaceae</i> (sterile), <i>Tetraphis pellucida</i>.
<p>Seen
in the vicinity was blooming Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa uniflora</i>).
<p>Our
fifth bryophyte sample (#5) was from a 32 inch (0.81 m) dbh dead, but
standing, White Oak, which yielded :
<p><i>Anomodon 
attenuatus</i>, <i>Anomodon rostratus</i>,
<i>Campylium chrysophyllum</i>,
<i>Cololejeunea biddlecomiae</i> (Li),
<i>Fissidens adianthoides</i>, <i>Fissidens osmundioides</i>, <i>Lejunea</i> sp (<i>cavifolia</i>?) (Li), <i>Mnium cuspidatum</i>, <i>Radula 
complanata</i> (Li), <i>Rhodobryum 
roseum</i>.
<p>A
single plant of Wild Sarsaparilla was observed nearby.
<p>Our
next sample (#6) was from a down bole, which also bore abundant tiny Hemlock
seedlings. Bryophytes recorded were:
<p><i>Brotherella 
recurvans</i>, <i>Chiloscyphus 
profundus</i> (Li), <i>Dicranum fulvum</i>,
<i>Dicranum viride</i>, <i>Mnium hornum</i>, <i>Nowellia curvifolia</i> (Li), <i>Polytrichum 
ohioense</i>, <i>Scapaia nemorosa</i> (Li),
<i>Tetraphis pellucida</i>, <i>Trichocolea tomentella</i> (Li).
<p> An unidentified <i>Atrichum</i> moss was present on the soil
here, but was not observed in the above sample. Also in the vicinity was an
interesting white fungus related to slime molds (<i>Ceratiomyxa</i> sp) .
<p> We now encountered a very large Northern Red Oak
immediately adjacent to the trail, and bearing a large bracket fungus high up.
The following bryophyte sample (#7) was taken from this oak:
<p><i>Anomodon attenuatus</i>, <i>Brachythecium acuminatum</i>, <i>Brachythecium curtum</i>, <i>Brotherella tenuirostris</i>, <i>Eurhynchium hians</i>, <i>Rhynchostegium serrulatum</i>, <i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>.
<p> Now, at the trail's edge, we again came upon an
occurrence of blooming Star Violet, and nearby, observed a good exposure of
conglomeratic sandstone.
<p> Continuing west along the trail, we saw the following
fungi: the edible <i>Amanita vaginata</i>,
the uncertainly edible <i>Amanita 
flavoconia</i>, the barely edible
<i>Lactarius lignyotis</i>; also <i>Xeromphalina campanella</i>,
the edible <i>Tricholomopsis platyphylla</i> (&quot;Platterful&quot;),  the Deer
Mushroom  (<i>Pluteus cervinus</i>),  also edible, and tiny <i>Rickenella fibula</i>, as usual, growing in moss. We were then greeted by
the loud calls of a Pileated Woodpecker (<i>Dryocopus pileatus</i>)  .
<p> We next arrived at a very small, low terrace or flood
plain segment. Plants observed on the segment were American Water-pennywort,
Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed, Intermediate Shield Fern, Skunk Cabbage, Wrinkle-leaf
Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago rugosa</i>),  Hooked Crowfoot  (<i>Ranunculus 
recurvatus</i>),  Northern Swamp Buttercup (
<i>Ranunculus 
septentrionalis</i>),  Tall Coneflower, a large unidentified Iris
  (<i>Iris</i> sp),  Black Elderberry, Fowl Manna Grass, European Self-heal  (<i>Prunella vulgaris</i> var <i>vulgaris</i>), a
jewelweed, White Grass  (<i>Leersia virginica</i>),  Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel  (<i>Oxalis stricta</i>),  Deer-tongue Grass  (<i>Panicum clandestinum</i>),  the aliens Orchard Grass  (<i>Dactylis glomerata</i>)  and Garlic Mustard  (<i>Alliaria officinalis</i>),  a Northern Red Oak seedling, Virginia
Knotweed  (<i>Polygonum virginianum</i>),  Rough Avens (<i>Geum laciniatum</i>)  . Downy Many Knees  (<i>Polygonatum pubescens</i>)  and the alien forget-me-not. An
unidentified thrush gave us a quick glimpse here as well.
<p> A soil temperature determination (T-132) on the this
segment of flood plain yielded T=16.0 deg C, while a soil sample (2) had an
initial pH of 4.5 and the same value 24 hours later. Although sticky when wet,
this soil contained some silt in addition to clay, as lumps formed on drying,
could, with moderate effort, be broken with the fingers.
<p> Moving through upland terrain again, we soon came to a
patch of Stiff Clubmoss  (<i>Lycopodium annotinum</i>),  a species with a more northern
distribution than other Central Appalachian clubmosses. It was followed in
succession by the fungus <i>Amanita muscaria</i>,
blooming Groundberry, Common Greenbrier, Shining Clubmoss, Pennsylvania
Blackberry and a down bole with its barkless surface almost entirely covered by
the liverwort <i>Nowellia 
curvifolia</i>.
<p> We then arrived at the junction with the Giant Hemlock
Trail, where our (#8) bryophyte sample was taken from a large Hemlock,
resulting only in the followihg:
<p><i>Cephalozia 
catenulate</i> (Li), <i>Nowellia 
curvifolia</i> (Li), <i>Tetraphis 
pellucida</i>.
<p> Our next sample (#9), from a large down bole of a
mostly barkless Red Maple, was far richer:
<p><i>Anomodon attenuatus</i>,
<i>Bazzania trilobata</i> (Li),
<i>Brotherella recurvans</i>, <i>Bryum</i> sp,<i> Dicranella heteromalla</i>, <i>Entodon macropodus</i>, <i>Isopterygiopsis muelleriana</i>, <i>Lejeunea cavifolia</i>
(Li), <i>Mnium affine</i> var 
<i>ciliare</i>, <i>Nowellia curvifolia</i>
(Li), <i>Platygyrium repens</i>, <i>Polytrichum ohioense</i>, <i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>, <i>Trichocolea 
tomentella</i> (Li).
<p>As
we continued up the Giant Hemlock Trail, we saw our first Mountain Maple of the
traverse and, nearby, a large bush of Wild Raisin  (<i>Viburnum 
cassinoides</i>)  . We were then attracted to the characteristic Hemlock bracket
fungus <i>Ganoderma tsugae</i> at eye level on a large dying, but standing,
Hemlock. Visible on this fungus were several 1.5 cm-long, boldly-patterned, red
and black Pleasing Fungus Beetles (<i>Megalodacne heros</i>). 
<p>Still
moving along this Trail, we came to an area in which the ground cover was
dominated by Hay-scented and Intermediate Shield Ferns. Presumably this area
was part of Bieri and Anliot's (1965) Hemlock-Fern Community.
<p>A
soil temperature determination (T-133) here gave a result of T-16.0 deg C,
while a soil sample (3) had pH=3.7 both initially and 24 hours later.
<p>Farther
along the Trail we recorded in succession a Cucumbertree, a fallen Yellow Birch
that bore the northern polypore Piptoporus betulinus (Phillips. 1991), 
then the alien Hemp Nettle  (<i>Galeopsis tetrahit</i>),  a Tuliptree sapling and, at the base of a
living Black Cherry, the interesting and edible Berkeley's Polypore  (<i>Bondarzewia berkeleii</i>), likely a parasite on
this tree.
<p>Not
much farther along the Trail we came to a large patch of ground cover comprised
in large part of Tree Clubmoss and Ground Pine, and beyond this, a small seep
with Arrowwood Viburnum and Winterberry Holly and associated Cinnamon Fern
  (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>),  the large sedge <i>Carex folliculata</i>,
the common manna grass <i>Glyceria 
melicaria</i>, the northern manna grass <i>Glyceria laxa</i>, ground
Berry and Skunk Cabbage. On the adjacent upland we saw Painted Trillium, the
grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, a down bole apparently covered by a <i>Hypnum</i> moss, a species of the fungus <i>Ramaria</i> on dead conifer wood, and a conspicuous occurrence
of unidentified species of <i>Atrichum</i> and <i>Polytrichum</i>
mosses on the soil.
<p>During
the morning of 7-11-01 another traverse was made along the Cathedral Trail.
Post-cold front conditions prevailed after a rainy night. As our traverse
began, successively noted species were the fungus <i>Tylopolis felleus</i> (
Bitter Bolete), Round-leaf Violet  (<i>Viola rotundifolia</i>),  a large
patch of <i>Medeola</i> under Northern Red Oak
and the possibly poisonous fungus <i>Amanita pantherina</i>. Many unidentified
bird voices in the canopy as well as 
exposures of non-conglomeratic sandstone were also noted.
<p>Our
next bryophyte sample (#10) was now taken from a one foot (0.3 m) dbh Yellow
Birch, with the following result:
<p><i>Bazzania trilobata</i>
(Li), <i>Brotherella recurvans</i>,
<i>Dicranum montanum</i>, <i>Hypnum pallescens</i>, <i>Plagiothecium laetum</i>, <i>Tetraphis pellucida</i>.
<p> A bryophyte sample (#11) from a 3 foot (0.9 m) dbh White
Oak exhibited the following species:
<p><i>Anomodon 
rostratus</i>, <i>Campylium 
chrysophyllum</i>, <i>Fissidens 
poypodioides</i>, <i>Mnium cuspidatum</i>,
<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>.
<p> We now arrived again at the location of previously
cited Long-bracted Green Orchis. Moving west from there along the trail, we
noted in succession the fungus <i>Xeromphalina kauffmanii</i> on hardwood, an
unidentified vereo-like bird call, the abundance of Red Maple seedlings on the
ground and those of Hemlock both on the ground and among mosses on the larger
down boles.
<p> The next bryophyte sample (#12) was taken from a decayed
stump, which, to the unaided eye, appeared covered by some species of Atrichum
and Polytrichum. While the latter was apparently fortuitously excluded in our
sample, the following were found under the microscope:
<p><i>Atrichum 
undulatum</i>, <i>Brotherella 
recurvans</i>, <i>Dicranella 
heteromalla</i>, mats of <i>Dicranella heteromalla protonema</i>
<p> Following this a sample (#13) was taken from native
sandstone, which had:
<p><i>Brotherella 
recurvans</i>, <i>Dicranum viride</i>,
<i>Mnium punctatum</i>, <i>Sematphyllum demissum</i>, <i>Tetraphis pellucida</i>.
<p> Approaching the stream area once more, we noted Great
Rhododendron in bloom, the fungi <i>Polyporus varius</i> on dead hardwood and an
unidentified <i>Russula</i> and a seedling of
Mountain Ash.
<p> A bryophyte sample (#14) from rocks in mid-stream bore
the following:
<p><i>Amblystegium 
riparium</i>, <i>Eurhynchium 
riparioides</i>, <i>Mnium punctatum</i>,
<i>Pollia epiphylla</i> (Li), <i>Racomitrium aciculare</i>.
<p>Moving
along the Trail again, we identified in succession the Trail Rush  (<i>Juncus tenuis</i>)  on the beaten path, the mosses <i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>
and <i>Mnium hornum</i>, although tentatively, on soil, saw a two foot (0.6
m) dbh Yellow Birch and on dead Hemlock the fungi <i>Boletus badius</i> (edible),
<i>Dadaleopsis confragosa</i> and the unusual but edible <i>Pseudohydnum gelatinosum</i>.
An impression was also gained here of the widespread, if subordinate,
occurrence of the liverwort <i>Bazzania 
trilobata</i>.
<p>We
now came to a large patch of Hay-scented Fern that locally dominated the ground
flora. Our next bryophyte sample (#15) was taken, considerably off the Trail,
from rock among the Ferns. Only the following species were found:
<p><i>Bazzania trilobata</i>
(Li), <i>Dicranum fulvum</i>,
<i>Isopterygium elegans</i>.
<p> Additional species here were the grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>,
Mountain Oat Grass, a seedling of Cucumbertree and another Berkeley's Polypore,
this time at the base of a Hemlock, and bearing a large rove beetle of
unidentified species.
<p> A soil temperature determination (T-134) was also made
in the in the general area and a soil sample (4) taken. A temperature T= 17.0
deg C was obtained. The soil sample had pH=3.7 initially and this increased to
4.0 twenty four hours later. This soil had a one inch (2.5 cm) -thick mor
layer over pinkish-gray mineral soil. Hard lumps formed on drying, indicating
high clay content. Some species in the immediate sample area were a two foot (
0.6 m) dbh Northern Red Oak, seedlings of Red Maple, Pennsylvania Blackberry
and Intermediate Shield Fern. A large fritillary butterfly was also seen here.
<p> Still off the Trail, we came upon a patch of seedlings of
the Asiatic water Pepper  (<i>Polygonum cespitosum</i>)  which may have had its origin in Black
Bear  (<i>Ursus americanus</i>) or
other animal scat. Independent patches of White Wood Sorrel were present in the
area as well.
<p> Our last bryophyte sample (#16) was from a four foot (1.22 m) dbh Hemlock snag. Only the following were found:
<p><i>Bazzania trilobata</i>
 (Li), <i>Brotherella recurvans</i>, <i>Nowellia 
curvifolia</i> (Li), <i>Tetraphis 
pellucida</i>.
<p> The song of a Wood Thrush was now heard in the distance
and that of a Red-eyed Vireo nearby.
<p> Taking another trail, we began our return to our point of
origin. Successively tallied along this
trail were a fungus of the genus <i>Collybia</i> on
hardwood twigs, seedlings of Mountain Holly, the poisonous puffball <i>Scleroderma citrinum</i>;
then moving along the stream, the previously unreported shrub Ninebark  (<i>Physocarpus opulifolius</i>),  Turtlehead  (<i>Chelone glabra</i>),  White
Wood Aster, Sweet White Violet  (<i>Viola blanda</i>)  and the edible fungus <i>Amanita fulva</i>. We
terminated our traverse here.
<p> A pH determination was also made of water from the branch
of Rhine Creek that flows past the parking lot. This water was very acidic,
with pH= 4.5, indicating that acidic substrate also prevails up-stream from the
main tract of the Cathedral forest. It seems likely, however, that this acidity
is moderated where the stream enters the watershed on Greenbrier Limestone to
the north. Such moderation may also explain the fish observed on our 7-14-96
visit.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<p>Central here,
as in most of our studies, is the question of species and community stability.
Cathedral State Park is old growth primary forest and such forests are
sometimes regarded, or at least treated, as a forest type, as distinguished
from secondary forest. However, as emphasized by Braun (1950) and others,
forest types are products of climate, topography and soils, or ultimately of
the interaction of climate and the geologic base.
<p> The Cathedral forest is characterized by a large number
of northern / montane and moisture-loving vascular plants. Examples, not all of
which were seen by us, are Yellow Birch, Mountain Ash, Mountain Maple, Red
Elderberry, Yew, Hobblebush, Speckled Alder, Dwarf Cornell, Canada Mayflower,
Yellow Clintonia, White Wood Sorrel, Star Violet, Alpine enchanter's
Nightshade, Painted Trillium, Large-bracted Green Orchis, Glyceria Laxa and Stiff Clubmoss. It is thus of great interest to
compare the non-vascular flora, in particular bryophytes, to see if it too fits
this pattern. In the following discussion an examination is made of the known
environmental and substrate preferences of the observed bryophytes. Particular
attention is given the mosses, drawing upon the classic work of Crum and
Anderson (1981). Where cited in this section, this work is indicated by the
symbol (C&amp;A). Reference is also made to a high elevation oak forest near Reddish
Knob, to oak forests of the North River Valley and to a mesic deciduous forest
at Tea Creek on the Allegheny Plateau. Installation of our inventories in these
forests is pending.
<p> The four most frequently occurring bryophytes are all
characteristic of acidic, cool northern or montane habitats.
<p> <i>Brotherella 
recurvans</i> is found in &quot;generally
coniferous woods at higher elevations&quot;, :&quot;A northern and montane
species&quot; (C&amp;A). According to Cogbill (1996) this is one of the
characteristic mosses of spruce-fir forests throughout the northeast. 
<p> <i>Tetraphis 
pellucida </i> is &quot;An acidiphile&quot;,
&quot; in moist coniferous forests&quot;.(C&amp;A) An unusual feature at
Cathedral is this species common
occurrence on tree trunks, especially Hemlock. It was not found at all by us in
deciduous forest types at Reddish Knob, the North River Valley or at Tea Creek,
although it is part of the Hemlock forest at Ramsey's Draft as well as
some other Central Appalachian forests
with boreal components. 
<p> <i>Bazzania 
trilobata</i> and <i>Nowellia curvifolia</i> are
liverworts characteristic of cool, moist forests, with the former particularly
common in spruce-fir forests (Cogbill, 1996) . It is frequently the most
abundant bryophyte in Central Appalachian Red Spruce forests (Carvell, 1993) .
<p> <i>Anomodon 
attenuatus</i>, <i>Mnium cuspidatum</i> and <i>Thuidium 
delicatulum</i> are widely distributed
species, particularly in the northern and eastern US.
<p> <i>Chiloscyphus 
profundus</i> and <i>Lejeunea cavifolia</i> were
not found by Breil (1996) on the Virginia piedmont, a likely indication of
northern / montane preference.
<p> <i>Mnium 
punctatum</i> is usually found &quot;in
swampy, eutrophic coniferous woods&quot; (C&amp;A)
<p> <i>Campylium 
chrysophyllum</i>, <i>Fissidens 
polypodioides</i> and <i>Ctenidium molluscum</i> are
seemingly anomalous in that they appear to be markedly calciphile (C&amp;A).
However, in our sampling at Cathedral they were all found only on White Oak and
not on clearly acidic substrate. 
<p> Many of the minor species are well-known acidiphiles.
Examples are <i>Brotherella tenuirostris</i>, <i>Dicranum fulvum</i>, <i>Isopterygium elegans</i>, <i>Racomitrium aciculare</i>
and <i> Sematophyllum demissum</i> (C&amp;A). 
<p> A possible mechanism at work here is the transfer by
capillary action or otherwise of 
hydrogen ions from the acid soils to overlying moist down wood and tree
bases.
<p> <i>Brachythecium 
curtum</i> is found &quot;Newfoundland to Minnesota, south in the higher
mountains to North Carolina&quot;
<p> It is also interesting to compare the two <i>Hypnum</i> species. The most common species, <i>Hypnum curvifolium</i>
is characteristic of &quot;moist shady places&quot;, while <i>Hypnum pallescens</i>
is found
&quot; in dry or moist woods&quot; (C&amp;A). The latter was observed by us to
be the most frequent species in high elevation oak forest – presumably dryer
than Cathedral - near Reddish Knob.
<p> Another minor species, <i>Platygyrium repens</i>, had a
high frequency in all oak forests studied by us, and in at least one case, was
the most frequent bryophyte. 
<p> There is also a small element of southerners at
Cathedral. The best example is <i>Entoodon 
macropodus</i>- an exception that proves the
rule-&quot; Widespread in the southeastern United States (from Virginia to
Florida and west to Arkansas and Texas) &quot; (C&amp;A). 
<p> Cooper-Ellis (1998) undertook a comparative study of
bryophytes in old growth and secondary forests of western Massachusetts. Her
paper also includes an extensive bibliography of previous work. Six different
forest types were included. However, these were combined in the two groups of
old growth and secondary forest. Thus a comparison with our study program is
difficult. She found that the two dominant species at Cathedral, <i>Brotherella recurvans</i>
and <i>Tetraphis pellucida</i>, showed no particular pattern of distribution between
trees, down boles, rocks and soil, while <i>Hypnum pallescens</i>,
a minor species at Cathedral, was among the most common in both old growth and
secondary forests. The lack of pattern of <i>B. recurvans</i> and <i>T. pellucida</i>
may be a consequence of her combining <i>Tsuga canadensis</i> – <i>Betula 
allegheniensis</i> forest types with types dominated entirely by
hardwoods.
<p> The evidence of good reproduction of Hemlock found at
Cathedral State Park by Bieri and Anliot (1965) is perhaps not surprising for
the time of their study. However its continuance to the present time, as
observed by us, is unusual, given the current widespread destructive Whitetail
Deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>)  browsing of
this tree throughout the Central Appalachians. The effects of this Deer
browsing on the forests of Pennsylvania's Allegheny Plateau has been the
subject of extensive investigations by Bjorkbom and Larson (1977) and by
Whitney (1984), and they report large effects indeed. Another evergreen that
has fared less well at Cathedral, and in the Central Appalachians in general,
is the Yew  (<i>Taxus canadensis</i>). Although Bieri and Anliot reported its
presence, not a vestige was seen by us, and it seems likely that it has been
virtually eliminated by the recently greatly increased populations of Deer.
<p> While there is ample evidence of disturbance at Cathedral
in the form of remains of openings invaded by Pitch Pine and hardwoods, this
disturbance appears to have been on a small scale and confined to normal gap
formation. Runkle (1991) places the area in a region dominated by small gap
disturbance as distinguished from Pennsylvania's Allegheny Plateau, where he
finds larger scale blow-downs and fires to be of equal or greater importance.
Evidence of such large scale disturbances in the latter region were presented
by Hough (1936) and Hough and Forbes (1943). A point made by these authors is
that fire was less prevalent in Hemlock 
than in other less moist forests and in forests on exposed topography.
However, if preceded by a blow-down, any Hemlock forest became vulnerable to
fire. In any case, little or no evidence of fire was observed by us at
Cathedral.
<p> Our experience in the Cathedral forest supports
observations of the clear relationship between individual species, forest type,
topography and geologic substrate. First, the great majority of observed
species of vascular plants are either of wide occurrence or are markedly acidiphile, in agreement with measured soil pH and the observed substrate of
conglomeratic sandstone. Secondly, a large number of these species, perhaps 17
or more, are also northern or montane in distribution, in harmony with the
regional climate as modified by the local topography. Finally, both the
observed species of bryophytes and their frequencies in a variety of
microhabitats reflect the same environmental factors as do the vascular plants.
Unfortunately, it was not possible in the time available, to investigate
possible small scale variations in the geologic substrate and related
variations, if any, in the flora, such as were found by us at The Gaudineer
Scenic Area and in The Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove. We did not, for example,
have an opportunity to explore the southern extension of the Park. Also, less
clear than the readily observed relations described above, may be a general
ambiance and feedback that integrates light intensity and quality, moisture,
substrate chemistry, micro-topography and biologic elements to produce a
community that would not exist but for the presence of all of these elements.
More evidence of this interpretation will be provided in future presentations
of our inventories in other forest types. 
<p> Our attention was 
drawn however to floral elements apparently out of harmony with the
dominant oligotrophic, acidic community, particularly on slopes below trails
and route US 50. This takes the form of dense growths of mesic, nutrient
–demanding native herbs such as Wood Nettle and Honewort as well as introduced
species. It seems apparent from these growths that nutrients and alkaline
solutions have originated in path and road gravels and washed down-slope. It is
also possible that some other species, first recorded by Bieri and Anliot
(1965), and which also seem in conflict
with the dominant flora, originated in this way, Restoration of the natural
community would require cessation of the use of limestone gravels on paths and
barriers to prevent road-wash. Ideally, as much as possible of the offending
material would also be removed from paths and drainways.
<p> It should also be pointed out that, while soils here are
very acidic and appear to have a mor-type structure, they lack the thick, dark,
highly organic upper horizon that is characteristic of purely coniferous old
growth forests. They share this feature with the acidic soils of The Gaudineer
Scenic Area, which also has a prominent deciduous component, in that case with
Red Spruce.

<p> 
<p>Dear Mr. Pope,
<p> I have a
few things to report regarding our recent inventory of Cathedral State Park. Dr
Hunsucker and I appreciate your permission to inventory this important natural
area.
<p> First, we
do believe that all employees connected to the Park in your Division are doing
their utmost to protect and enhance this great public resource. However we
believe certain management practices as well as outside influences are
seriously jeopardizing the ecological features of the Park that are important
to keeping it in a pristine condition, especially with regard to its value for
scientific studies. Among the most damaging practices is the use of limestone
gravels on the walking paths. These gravels are also washed farther into the
Park by the hard rains that are frequent in the area. The original rock that
underlies the Park is conglomeratic sandstone, which creates a very acidic
substrate for plant growth. Thus acidiphile plants dominate its flora. However
limestone is alkaline, acts to neutralize the original acid and contributes
additional nutrients, with the result that around, and particularly down-slope
from these paths, the original flora is being replaced by lime tolerant and
more nutrient demanding plants such as Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>), Honewort (<i>Cryptotaenia canadensis</i>) and other natives which
originally may have occurred in very limited parts of the Park, or by alien
species such as Common Burdock (<i>Arctium 
minus</i>) and Coltsfoot (<i>Tussilago farfara</i>), which should not occur at all.
<p> A similar
process is occurring as a result of erosion of and wash from the embankments of
Route 50, and this may be even more serious than the limestone paths as
chemicals in addition to lime may be involved
<p> The use of
limestone for paths or as lining for drainways should immediately be
discontinued and the removal of old limestone attempted as much as is
practicable. The West Va Department of Transportation should be contacted to
see about stabilization of the road embankments. Sandstone or quartzite gravels
should be substituted in the Park and in all drainways that lead into the Park.
Native stone similar to that that underlies the Park would be preferred. We
hope you will consider taking these measures to restore and protect the future
integrity of this natural and national treasure. 
<p> We hope in the near future to make available to
you a more complete report on our inventories this year. We also hope to
continue these studies in the future. Once again, thanks for the opportunity to
work in this park.
<p>&nbsp;
<p> Sincerely,
<p>
