<h1>Craig Creek Watershed</h1>

<blockquote>




<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<p>
The Craig Creek Watershed, a part of the James River System, occupies a major -largely 
linear- valley and adjacent mountain slopes and drainages extending from near Eagle 
Rock to the New River divide near Blacksburg, Virginia.  The watershed is underlain 
by dominantly Devonian rocks of the Brallier, Milboro Shale and Needmore Formations, 
but also includes some Silurian rocks on upper mountain slopes.  Consequently, it 
is not favored by fertile soils either for its forests or agriculture, except in 
selected areas of more extensive alluvium and colluvium.  Completely excluded are the nutrient-rich 
limestones and dolomites of the Ordovician and Cambrian formations. <p>
To a large degree the upper valley is defined by the linear wall of Sinking Creek 
Mountain to the northwest and the less impressive Brush and North Mountains on the 
southwest.  Rich Patch Mountain and a number of smaller ranges serve this function 
in the lower valley.  Johns and Barbours Creeks are major tributaries that cut across the 
ranges from the west, where they drain high mountain slopes and parts of the Mountain 
Lake and Barbours Creek Wilderness areas.<p>
Inventories reported here include a traverse along Dragon's Tooth Trail on the headwaters 
of McAfee Run, a mainstem site at Caldwell Fields, a mainstem site at the Craig Creek 
Campground and a short traverse along Stony Run in the Hoop Hole Wilderness Study Area.  As is usual in this work, both scientific and common names of species are 
given on first mention and only common names there after.  Exceptions are common 
woody plants and herbs with obscure or missing common names.<p>
<p>
</ul>
<h2>Dragon's Tooth Trail </h2><ul>
<strong>Source Walk: 8-16-97, hot, clear, dry</strong><p>
Features of special interest in the area are both Canada and Carolina Hemlocks (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>
 an <i>T. caroliniana</i>) and the rare shrub Piratebush (<i>Buckleya distichophylla</i>).  Unfortunately, both species of Hemlock are heavily infested by the Hemlock Wooly 
Adelgid.<p>
Our traverse began at the parking lot near Route 311 and extended for perhaps 2/3 
mile (1 km) from an elevation of about 1750 ft (530 meters) to somewhat above 2200 
feet (670 meters) asl.  Because the Trail crosses and comes close to the stream in 
several places and the ravine sides are generally dry and rocky, there are a number of close 
juxtapositions of dry and more mesic habitats as reflected in the flora.  In what 
follows,our observations are presented in the sequence in which they were made.<p>
A spot inventory was done of the forest immediately above the parking lot.  An outcrop 
of shale was noted here.  The canopy was young and the area had apparently suffered 
a recent ground fire.  White Oak, mostly less than 10 inches (25 cm) dbh, dominated, but there were also Black Birch, Red Maple, Scarlet and Black Oaks, Black Gum, Black 
Locust, Sassafras, Tuliptree, Cucumbertree, a little American Basswood and both Canada 
and Carolina Hemlocks. Understory included Serviceberry (probably <i>Amelanchier arborea</i>) and Striped Maple, while a shrub layer consisted of Beaked Hazelnut (<i>Corylus cornuta</i>), Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum acerifolium</i>), Upland Low Blueberry (Vaccinium pallidum), a little Buffalonut (<i>Pyrularia pubera</i>), Witch Hazel (<i>Hamameis virginiana</i>) and scattered Piratebush, including post-fire sprouts.  A little farther up the 
trail these were joined by a few White Pine, White Ash, Redbud (<i> Cercis canadensis </i>) and Dwarf Spiraea (<i>Spiraea betulifolia</i>
 or <i>S</i>
. <i>corymbosa</i>).<p>
Herbs and vines associated with these species were abundant Galax (<i>Galax aphylla</i>), American Ipecac (<i>Gillenia stipulata</i>), White Wood Aster (<i>Aster divaricatus</i>), Heartleaf (<i>Hexastylis virginica</i>), Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>), Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>), Panicled Hawkweed (<i>Hieracium paniculatum</i>), Whorled Tickseed (<i>Coreopsis verticillata</i>), Bootts Goldenrod (<i>Solidago boottii</i>), Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</i>), Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus radicans</i>) and Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>).  The alien Asiatic Dayflower (<i>Commelina communis</i>) may also seen.<p>
The trail, which here occupies the ravine side northwest of the stream, soon approaches 
close to the latter and eventually crosses it to a high, rocky slope beyond.  Successively 
noted on the approach to the stream were Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>), White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium rugosum</i>), Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata</i>), Calico Aster (<i>Aster lateriflorus</i>), calls of the Red-eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>), Summer Grape (<i>Vitis aestivalis</i>), White Grass (<i>Leersia virginica</i>), White Avens (<i>Geum canadense</i>), Horse Balm (<i>Collinsonia canadensis</i>), Wild Potato Vine (<i>Ipomoea pandurata</i>), Pasture Rose (<i>Rosa carolina</i>), Autumn Bent-grass (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>), Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>), Black Haw Viburnum (<i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>), White Ash, American Alumroot (<i>Heuchera americana</i>) and Virginia Knotweed (<i>Polygonum virginianum</i>).  Climbing beyond the stream, which was almost dry, there was Mountain Laurel, Sourwood, 
Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>), Sessil-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia sessilifolia</i>), more signs of recent fire with sprouting Piratebush, Devils Bit (<i>Chamaelirium luteum</i>), Red Pignut Hickory (<i>Carya ovalis</i>) and Adelgid-infested Carolina Hemlock followed by abundant Sourwood.<p>
At this point a spot inventory yielded Chestnut Oak, White Pine, Canada and Carolina 
Hemlocks, Black Gum, Tuliptree, Red Maple, Sourwood, Striped Maple, Catawba Rhododendron 
(<i>Rhododendron catawbiens)</i>
, Mountain Laurel, Galax and <i>Leucobryum</i>
 and <i>Dicranum</i>
 mosses.<p>
Not far beyond this we encountered an extraordinarily diverse community for this dry 
slope.  The canopy extending over approximately ¼ acre (0.10 hectare) consisted of 
Chestnut Oak, Red Maple, Black Gum, White Pine, Canada and Carolina Hemlocks, Pignut 
Hickory, Cucumbertree, Beech and Tuliptree while the understory had Striped Maple with 
an unidentified holly, perhaps <i>Ilex montana</i>
.  Accompanying shrubs were Mountain Fetterbush (<i>Pieris floribunda</i>), Witch Hazel, Maple-leaf Viburnum, a little Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea arborescens</i>), Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia pilosa</i>) and, unusual for this comparatively low elevation, Southern Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium erythrocarpum</i>), here with red berries.  Associated herbs and small heaths were Gaywings (<i>Polygala paucifolia</i>), Bowman's Root (<i>Gillena trifoliata</i>), Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>), Carolina Lily (<i>Lilium michauxii</i>), Partridge Berry, Devil's Bit, a <i>Clintonia</i>
 (probably <i>Clintonia umbellulata</i>), Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>), Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, Four-leaved Yam, Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex</i>
/<i>canadensis</i>) and a Tick-trefoil (<i>Desmodium nudiflorum</i>).<p>
Farther up the ravine, we saw more Beaked Hazelnut, Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii</i>), and  in a moister area, Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>), Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus virginicus</i>), Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>) and Black Birch.  Conspicuous here, as quite generally, were massive blocks of sandstone, 
which seemed to dominate the ravine since the shale observed initially at lower elevations.<p>
The trail now followed again the ravine's northwest side, revealing the forest grass 
<i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>
, Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium purpureum</i>) and the first Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila maculata</i>).  Here also, after some difficulty we identified a deciduous-holly as Mountain Holly 
of an unusual variety, namely <i>Ilex montana</i>
 var. <i>mollis</i>
.  This was followed successively by Golden Alexanders (<i>Zizia trifoliata</i>), Tall Agrimony (<i>Agrimonia gryposepala</i>), White-haired Panic Grass (<i>Panicum villosissimum</i>), Tuliptree, Striped Maple, <i>Leucobryum</i>
 moss, Moccasin Flower (<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>) in bloom, Mountain Bellwort (<i>Uvularia pudica</i>), <i>Carex bushii</i>
, and Indian Tobacco (<i>Lobelia inflata</i>).  At this point we observed an interesting Rove Beetle and an amber and black-patterned, 
centimeter-long, wedge-shaped beetle that had been observed by us in many other locations 
in the Central Appalachian forest, but remained unidentified.<p>
Continuing again through dry and acidic terrain, species noted were White, Red and 
Chestnut Oaks, White Pine, Red Maple, Catawba Rhododendron, Bushy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum dichotomum</i>), Palmate-leaf Violet (<i>Viola polmata</i>), Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i>), American Chestnut Sprouts and a patch of the orchid, Whorled Pagonia (<i>Isotria verticillata</i>) with seed pods.  These were followed by stunted Allegheny Fly-back grass (<i>Danthonia compressa</i>), Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>) and the moss <i>Bryoandersonia illecebra</i>
, then in very ericaeous  terrain by Spotted Wintergreen in close association with 
Teaberry with Recurved Fetterbush (<i>Leucothoe recurva</i>), Saw Brier (<i> Smilax glauca </i>) <i> </i>
 and Early Goldenrod (<i>Solidago juncea</i>).<p>
We had now reached an elevation of 500 feet (150 meters) or more above our start and 
began our return.  A few species of considerable interest that we had missed on the 
way up but saw on our way down were Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>), Lovage (<i>Ligusticum canadense</i>), Basil Balm (<i>Monardaclinopodia</i>) and Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigaea repens</i>).  Also seen were the fungi <i>Amanita daucipes</i>
, a beautiful <i>Boletus miniato-pallescens</i>
 and <i>Gymnopilus penetrans</i>
.<p>

<h2>Caldwell Fields </h2><ul>
<strong>Source Walks: 8-16-97, 8-17-97, warm, humid, some clouds</strong><p>
Remote in location, Caldwell Fields lies on the upper Craig Creek mainstem near the 
New River divide.  It is the site of a Jefferson National Forest Campground.  To 
reach the area by road from McAfee Run, passage is through increasingly marginal 
farm land being reclaimed by forest and is scenically notable by the looming presence of Sinking 
Creek Mountain.  Topographically subdued, the Creek's Valley and floodplain are still 
narrow and the campground undistinguished, except for its lack of sanitary facilities.  Yet the stream gave us a refreshing respite at the end of a hot and humid day.<p>
Rocks in the vicinity appear to be a sequence of thin-bedded shales and siltstones 
with minor sandstone.  However no reaction was obtained to acid, so it is unclear 
how much carbonate may be present.<p>
An inventory of the floodplain (first bottom) near camp revealed a youthful canopy 
of Black Walnut, a little Butternut, Sugar and Red Maples, Sycamore, Black Willow, 
Tuliptree, Black Locust, Black Cherry, Shagbark Hickory, Cucumbertree, Black Oak 
and White, Pitch and Virginia Pines.  Most conspicuous in the understory was Muscletree (<i>Carpinus caroliniana</i>) but it was accompanied by Flowering Dogwood, Redbud,  Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus</i>
 sp.) and Virginia Juniper (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>).  Shrubs, including those of partly open wetland, were represented by Silky Dogwood 
(<i>Cornus amomum</i>), Shrubby St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum prolificum</i>), Witch Hazel, Smooth Alder (<i>Alnus serrulata</i>), Silky Willow (<i>Salix sericea</i>), Allegheny Blackberry (<i>Rubus allegheniensis</i>), Black Elderberry with ripe berries, and American Hazelnut (<i>Corylus americana</i>), laden with nuts where these fruit-bearers grew in the open.  Accompanying them 
were such vines as Poison Ivy, Virginia Creeper and Winter Grape (<i>Vitis vulpina</i>) with the last named also fruit-bearing.<p>
Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) grew in a few places on steep rocky River banks, the alien shrub Autumn Olive (<i>Elaeagnus umbellata</i>) was scattered throughout and Japanese Honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera japonica</i>) was a minor component of openings.<p>
A variety of native and non-native grasses were found here. Rice Cutgrass (<i>Leersia oryzoides</i>), White Grass, Deer Tongue Grass (<i>Panicum clandestinum</i>), the manna grasses <i>Glyceria striata</i>
 <i>and G. grandis</i>
, Wood Reed-grass (<i>Cinna arundinacea</i>), Autumn Bent Grass (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>) and the alien Canada Bluegrass (<i>Poa compressa</i>) were confined mostly to openings such as the wetland with Smooth Alder.  Those within 
the forest and at its edge included Bottlebrush Grass (<i>Hystrix patula</i>), <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>
, Canada Brome Grass, now past its prime, <i>Bromus latiglumis</i>
, still fresh-appearing, Bushy Panic Grass and Slender-flowered Muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia tenuiflora</i>).  A few species, much trampled in the campground, were <i>Eragrostis pectinacea</i>
  and <i>Digitaria ischaemum</i>
.  The wetland grasses were accompanied by the sedges <i>Carex lurida,</i>
 <i>C. frankii</i>
, <i>C. vulpina</i>
, <i>C. lupulina</i>
, <i>Scirpus pollyphyllus</i>
 and <i>Cyperus strigosus</i>
 and the rush <i>Juncus effusus</i>
.  Other wetland herbs were Wingstem (<i>Verbesina alternifolia</i>), Yellow Sneezeweed (<i>Helenium autumnale</i>), Common Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium fistulosum</i>), Purple-leaved Willow-herb (<i>Epilobium coloratum</i>), Common Monkey Flower (<i>Minulus ringens</i>) in bloom, Boneset (<i>Eupatorium perfoliatum</i>), Tear Thumb (<i>Polygonum sagittatum</i>), New York Ironweed (<i>Vernonia noveboracensis</i>), Mad-dog Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria lateriflora</i>), Clearweed (<i>Pilea pumila</i>), Ditch Stonecrop (<i>Penthorum sedoides</i>), Marsh Purslane (<i>Ludwigia palustris</i>), Cardinal Flower (<i>Lobelia cardinalis</i>) and False Nettle (<i>Boehmeria cylindrica</i>).<p>
Other herbs characteristic of dryer and more shaded habitats were the alien Chinese 
Yam (<i>Dioscorea batatas</i>), Pale Indian Plantain (<i>Cacalia atriplicifolia</i>) in bloom, Hog Peanut, Honewort (<i>Cryptotaenea canadensis</i>), Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis stricta</i>), Calico Aster, Small Yellow Crownbeard (<i>Verbesina occidentalis</i>), Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa uniflora</i>), Pinesap (<i>M. hypopithys</i>), Thin-leaved Sunflower (<i>Helianthus decapetalus</i>), Wild Bergamot (<i>Monarda fistulosa</i>), a Hairy-jointed Meadow Parsnip (<i>Thaspium barbinode</i>), Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>), Christmas Fern, New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis</i>) and Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>).  Common Plantain (<i>Plantago rugelii</i>) occurred in the campground and Twisted Sedge (<i>Carex torta</i>) was present in the stream.<p>
The second bottom or terrace here is well marked by steep banks to the southeast of 
the stream.  It is generally covered by a young forest of Pitch, Virginia and White 
Pines that probably dates to the reclamation of an agricultural clearing.  Because 
of its elevated position and porous subsoils, it is dry and acidic in character.  In places 
it is clearly marked also by a heavy cover of Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>).  Sassafras is also common, as are small saplings of Carolina Hemlock.  The latter 
are curiously placed at intervals of 50 to 100 feet (15-30 meters) and range in size 
from six inches (15 cm)  to about four feet (1.2 meters) in height.  These trees 
are probably the result of natural seeding but grow slowly in the shade of the pines.  
Other woody plants noted were Deer Berry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i>), Upland Low Blueberry.  St. Andrews Cross (<i>Hypericum stragalum</i>), a little Summer Grape, Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>) and Hispid Greenbrier (<i>S. hispida</i>).  Common herbs were <i>Carex debilis</i>
 , <i>C. amphibola</i>
, <i>C. laxiflora</i>
, Trailing Bush Clover (<i>Lespedeza procumbens</i>), Hairy Bedstraw (<i>Galium pilosum</i>), Slender-leaved Summer Bluets (<i>Houstonia tenuifolia</i>), Spotted Wintergreen, Pinesap, Purple Sneezeweed (<i>Helenium flexuosum</i>), Creeping Five-leaf, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, White-haired Panic Grass, Common 
Speedwell (<i>Veronica officinalis</i>), Arrow-leaved Violet (<i>Viola sagittata</i>), Nimblewill (<i>Muhlenbergia schreberi</i>) and a trio of stunted grasses consisting of <i>Tridens flavus</i>
, Wood Reed-grass, and Broom Sedge (<i>Andropogon virginicus</i>).  Mosses were represented by cushions of <i>Leucobryum</i>
 and <i>Dicranum</i>
 with tiny <i>Rickenella</i>
 fibula fungi imbedded in the latter.  <i>Pluteus cirvinus</i>
 was another fungus seen here.<p>
Faunal observations included numerous small fish in the stream, a female Box Turtle 
(<i>Terapene carolina</i>) on the floodplain, Dragonflies, a spectacular white patterned hornet and the calls 
of Green Frogs and Yellow-billed Cuckoos (<i>Coccyzus americanus</i>).  Monarch (<i>Danaus plexippus</i>), dark Swallowtails (<i>Papilia</i>
 sp.) and numerous Red-spotted Purple (<i>Limenitis arthemis astyanax</i>) Butterflies were constantly present around camp and along the stream.  These were 
also joined by large black horseflies that pursued one with a deep buzz.  Summer 
Cicadas called during the day and at night were replaced by Katydids that sounded 
identical to those in the vicinity of Staunton in the Shenandoah Valley.  Bats, probably of 
several species, flitted overhead throughout the evening and after dark, while a 
Screech Owl (<i>Otus asio</i>) and later a Barred Owl (<i>Strix varia</i>) called in the late evening, but only briefly.  During the early morning of 8-17-97 
a Red-shouldered Hawk (<i>Buteo lineatus</i>) was heard over the mountain.  Among other birds seen and/or heard were Tufted Timouse 
(<i>Parus bicolor</i>), Cardinal (<i>Cardinalis cardinalis</i>) and Pileated Woodpecker (<i>Dryocopus pileatus</i>), Small unidentified species were frequently present in the canopy.  Also evidence 
of moles in the form of burrows and heavings was common.  The weather was generally 
pleasant with clear blue skies, white rapidly moving clouds from Sinking Creek Mountain 
and an almost full moon rising into the night sky.<p>

<h2>Craig Creek Campground </h2><ul>
<strong>Source Walks: 8-17-97, 8-18-97, warm, humid</strong><p>
Craig Creek is a strong stream at this campground of the Jefferson National Forest. 
 The stream is somewhat entrenched but well-defined terraces are present.  After 
a preliminary later afternoon survey along the River Trail, thundershowers threatened, 
but none resulted.  However the stream again offered us an opportunity to wash away the 
heat of the day.<p>
The canopy in the immediate vicinity of the Creek appeared to be dominated by Northern 
Red and Black Oaks, but with abundant Sugar and Red Maple, Sycamore, Tuliptree, Cucumbertree, 
Black Locust, Black Walnut, Bitternut and Mockernut Hickories and very large River Birch (<i>Betula nigra</i>) at the stream edge.  Less common were Hackberry (<i>Celtis occidentalis</i>), American Elm, Slippery Elm, Sassafras, White Ash, Black Gum, Black Cherry and American 
Basswood (only one seen).  A few small Catalpa (<i>Catalpa</i>
 sp.) were also seen.  Red Maple was most abundant downstream from the campground 
in sandy soil areas.  Despite the fertile soil, Black Cherry had the poor form characteristic 
of this tree in the Valley and Ridge.<p>
Subordinate and understory trees noted were Muscletree, Redbud, Flowering Dogwood., 
Virginia Juniper and Paw Paw, the last named bearing large and abundant fruit.  Present 
also was a diverse assemblage of shrubs including Wild Hydrangea, American Strawberry Bush (<i>Euonymus americanus</i>), Pasture Rose, Wafer Ash (<i>Ptelea trifoliata</i>), Black Raspberry (<i>Rubus occidentalis</i>), Coralberry (<i>Symphoricarpos orbiculatus</i>), Black Elderberry, Silky Dogwood, Mapleleaf and Black Haw Viburnums, Spice Bush, 
Shrubby St. Johns-wort and the alien Japanese Bushclover (<i>Lespedeza bicolor</i>), Winged Sumac (<i>Rhus capallina</i>) occurred on dry terrace sites with Shrubby St. Johns-wort and Wild Plumb (<i>Prunus americana</i>) was present on clearing edges.  Vines were represented by the Dewberries <i>Rubus enslenii</i>
 and <i>R. flagellaris</i>
, Canada Moonseed (<i>Menispermum canadense</i>), Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>), Saw Brier, Hispid Greenbrier, Poison Ivy, Virginia Creeper, Bittersweet (<i>Celastrus scandens</i>) and Summer and Winter Grapes.<p>
Among herbs, grasses were conspicuous.  Identified were the wild ryes, <i>Elymus villosus</i>
 <i>and E. riparius</i>
, abundant Bottlebrush Grass, Nimblewill, Slender-flowered Muhly, Nodding Fescue, 
Deer-tongue Grass, Canada Brome Grass, <i>Bromus latiglumis</i>
, showy <i>Chasmanthium latifolium</i>
, Canada Bluegrass and in fields and at the forest edge, Purple Love Grass (<i>Eragrostis spectabilis</i>), Purpletop (<i>Triodia flava</i>), Flat-stemmed Panic Grass (<i>Panicum anceps</i>) and Broomsedge (<i>Andropogon virginicus </i>).  Although ferns were not common, Christmas Fern, Ebony Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium platyneuron</i>), Cut-leaf Grapefern (<i>Botrychium dissectum</i>) and New York Fern grew along the trail, while Sensitive Fern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>) and Royal Fern (<i>Osmunda regalis</i>) were scattered along the shore.<p>
A no-doubt incomplete tally of other herbs included Thin-leaved Sunflower, Wing Stem, 
Sweet-scented Bedstraw, White Wood Aster, Common Joe-pye weed, Honewort, Calico Aster, 
Wreath Goldenrod (<i>Solidago caesia</i>), Plume Lily, Wild Geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>), Hog Peanut, Black Snakeroot (<i> Sanicula canadensis</i>), White Avens, Thimbleweed (<i>Anemone virginiana</i>), Horse Balm, Black Cohosh , Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>), Tall Agrimony, Dotted St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum punctatum</i>), Cardinal Flower, Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio aureus</i>), Tall Coneflower (<i>Rudbeckia laciniata</i>), False Nettle, Fringed Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia ciliata</i>), American Dog Violet (<i>Viola conspersa</i>), Old Field Goldenrod (<i>Solidago nemoralis</i>), Smooth Rockcress (<i>Arabis laevigata</i>), Virginia Knotweed, Blue Wood Aster (<i>Aster cordifolius</i>), the alien Prickly Lettuce (<i>Lactuca scariola</i>), Long-leaved Summer Bluets (<i>Houstonia longifolia</i>), Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum biflora)</i>
, White Vervain (<i>Verbena urticifolia</i>), American Alumroot, Squaw-weed (<i>Senecio obovatus</i>), Wrinkled-leaf Goldenrod, Pale Indian Plantain, Late Goldenrod (<i>Solidago giganteus</i>), Robin's Plantain (<i>Erigeron pulchellus</i>), Selfheal (<i>Prunella vulgaris</i>) and at the stream edge Yellow Passion Flower (<i>Passiflora lutea</i>). Water Willow (<i>Justicia americana</i>) formed large beds in the stream.<p>
As previously stated, of the order of ¼ mile (400 meters) downstream from the campground 
the rich flora described above gives way to one with Red Maple prominent in the canopy 
and much diminished shrub and herb diversity and density.  Here we saw Winterberry Holly (<i>Ilex verticillata</i>), Creeping Five-leaf, Meadow Garlic (<i>Allium canadense</i>), Wild Sage (<i>Salvia lyrata</i>), Trailing Bush Clover and Canada Bluegrass.  The change in flora may be related 
to a somewhat sandy soil here.<p>
After our traverse downstream along the river trail we returned to the campground 
via the adjacent terrace.  This area appears to be reverting to forest but contained 
a plantation of Black Walnut saplings.  These were accompanied by Tuliptree, Red 
Maple, Shrubby St. Johns-wort, Winged Sumac and herbs dominated by Purple Top , Broomsedge 
, Black-eyed Susan (<i>Rudbeckia herta</i>), Mountain Mint (<i>Pycnathemum tenuifolium</i>) and American Germander (<i>Teucrium canadense</i>).<p>
The Katydids that called at dusk here appeared to be a different species than those 
at Caldwell Fields since their call was a more rapid repetition of the phrase.  Inspection 
of the stream revealed nine-inch (23 cm) trout, small coiled gastropods and bivalves up to several inches in dimension.  Also present were Whirligig Beetles (<i>Gyrinidae</i>) in small groups.  Few birds were seen or heard with the exception of Ravens (<i>Corvus corax</i>) and Cardinals, although little attention was given to their observation.  A feature 
of the stream was its striking clarity, which added to the scenic quality of its 
riffles, wooded shores and verdant patches of Water Willow.<p>
The stream side here is obviously the site of rich alluvial deposits, albeit with 
variations in this richness as documented in our inventories.  Although our brief 
visit did not permit an exhaustive search, no fragments of limestone were found in 
the alluvium.  Also, soil richness seemed greatest in close proximity to the stream where 
sediment renewal is more frequent, although this also may be a too hasty conclusion.<p>
<p>
</ul>
<h2>Hoop Hole </h2><ul>
<strong>Source Walk: 8-18-97, early afternoon, pleasant</strong><p>
Hoop Hole is a wilderness study area of the Jefferson National Forest on the flank 
of Rich Patch Mountain.  Elevations range from 1200 ft (370 meters) near Craig Creek 
to 3700 ft (1130 meters) asl on Montgomery Knob.  Rocks are dominated by Silurian 
sandstones of the Keefer, Rose Hill and Tuscarora Formations (undivided), but Devonian 
formations such as the Ridgley Sandstone and perhaps carbonate-bearing members are 
also present in the area.<p>
Our inventory was done along Story Run beginning at the recreational trail parking 
lot adjacent to State Route 615 and extended upstream for near ¼ mile (400 meters). 
 The elevation here is near 1300 ft (400 meters) asl, and the forest is generally 
dry and ericaceous oak forest, although some mesic vegetation occurs along the stream.<p>
The canopy at the trail-head consists of mature White, Chestnut, Black, Northern Red 
and Scarlet Oaks, Red Maple, Black Gum, Pignut Hickory and Sassafras, with Sourwood 
and Serviceberry (Probably <i>Amelanchier arborea</i>) in the understory.  Some Pitch Pine and Adelgid-infected Canada Hemlock are also 
present.  Shrubs and vines include Upland Low Blueberry, Deer Berry, Mountain Laurel 
and Saw Brier.  Associated herbs and small heaths were Spotted Wintergreen, Trailing 
Arbutus, Galax, Partridge Berry, Wood Tickseed (<i>Coreopsis major</i>), Entire-leaved Yellow Foxglove (<i>Aureolaria laevigata</i>) in bloom, Toothed White-topped Aster (<i>Seriocarpus asteroides</i>), Wavy-leaf Aster (<i>Aster undulatus</i>), Late Purple Aster (<i>Aster patens</i>), Rattlesnake Weed (<i>Hieracium venosum</i>), an unidentified Iris, Slender-leaved Summer Bluets, Stiff Yellow Flax (<i>Linium medium</i>), Mountain Bellwort, Four-leaved Yam, the Tick Trefoils <i>Desmodium nudiflorum</i>
 and <i>D. paniculatum</i>
, Creeping Five-leaf, Goat's Rue (<i>Tephrosia virginiana</i>), Bushy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum dichotomum</i>), Variable Panic Grass (<i>P. commutatum</i>), White-haired Panic Grass, Black-seeded Needlegrass (<i>Stipa avenacea</i>), the mosses (<i>Dicranum</i>
 and <i>Leucobryum</i>
 and Delicate Fern Moss.  Macro-lichens were common on trees here and a Wood Pewee 
(<i>Contopus virens</i>) was seen.<p>
Moving closer to the stream, we encountered Bowman's Root, Poison Ivy, White Milkweed 
(<i>Asclepias variegata</i>), Four-leaved Milkweed (<i>A. quadrifolia</i>), Witch Hazel, White Wood Aster, Trailing Bush Clover, Plume Lily, Virginia Knotweed, 
Hog Peanut, Red Bud and Wild Potato Vine.  At the stream there was Paw Paw and not 
far beyond, a 3 inch (8 cm) dbh Hophornbeam, Curtis Goldenrod and surprisingly, Large-flowered Bellwort (<i>Uvularia grandiflora</i>), a species usually confined to limestone or other rich soils.<p>
Continuing along the trail parallel to the Run, we successively saw the Panic Grass 
<i>Panicum boscii</i>
, Cucumbertree, and in the treetops male and female scarlet tanagers (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>).  The male did not sing his characteristic song but gave a harsh call.  These were 
followed by Christmas Fern, Ebony Spleenwort, Hairy Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria elliptica</i>), Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria pubera</i>), Black Locust, Shrub-sized Black Cherry, Black Snakeroot, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, 
Wild Liquorice (<i>Galium cricaezans</i>), Horse Balm, Panicled Hawkweed, Wild Stonecrop (<i>Sedum ternatum</i>), Spice Bush, Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel, Smooth-Forked Chickweed (<i>Paronychia canadensis</i>), Muscletree, Maple-leaf Viburnum, Calico Aster, Golden Alexanders (<i>Zizia trifoliata</i>), Common Greenbrier, Smooth Alder, Flowering Dogwood, more (unidentified) birds, 
a <i>Houstonia</i>
 (possibly <i>H. serpyllifolia</i>), Bootts Goldenrod, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain and White Pine.<p>
At this point we became aware of many birds in the canopy around us.  Identified were 
Tufted Titmouse, Chickadee (probably <i>Parus caroliniensis</i>), Downy Woodpecker (<i>Picoides pubescens</i>), White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>Sitta caroliniensis</i>), a Pileated Woodpecker (<i>Drycopus pileatus</i>) and unidentified warblers and vireos.  It seems likely that their concentration 
here was correlated with the brief appearance of some insect prey.<p>
Above this elevation the trail became steeper and followed the southwest side of the 
ravine through which the stream flowed.  Here we saw <i>Carex pensylvanica</i>
, Poverty Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia spicata</i>), Beech, Devil's Bit, Striped Maple, Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana</i>), <i>Hypericum stragalum</i>
, "Fire Weed" (<i>Erechtites hieracifolia</i>), a species of Wood Rush (<i>Luzula</i>
 sp.) and Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium virginianum</i>).  In one place a linear rockfield of automobile-sized and jumbled blocks of sandstone 
line the ravine edge.  Species of interest along a section of the ravine upstream 
from this rock field were Buffalonut,Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>), Mountain Fetterbush, Slender-flowered Muhly and Hay-scented Fern.  Galax was extraordinarily 
abundant in a steep northwest-facing ravine slope and Striped Maple and Sourwood 
common.<p>
Although the terrain in the area inventoried is rocky and the forest generally dry 
and ericaceous even near the stream, mesic shrubs and herbs mingle with those of 
the upland forest in the ravine.  Trees in the ravine are generally taller, straighter 
and larger in diameter than those of the adjacent upland forest, where shrubs and herbs 
are sparse and the forest rather open.<p>
Although the habitat here bears some resemblance to that along the Dragon's Tooth 
Trail, the aspect differs, and the stream gradient is less steep.  While a number 
of species are shared by the two areas, there are also a number not shared, and the 
overall diversity along Stony Run appears to be greater.  It may be that this is attributable 
to carbonate-bearing beds in the watershed above.  However, more rare species appear 
to be present in the Dragon's Tooth area.<p>
