<h1>Cranberry Glades and Vicinity</h1>
<strong>Pocahontas County, West Virginia</strong>
<blockquote>


<p>
<b>Introduction</b><br>
<ul>
<dd>
The Cranberry Glades form a wetland complex in a deep valley beneath some of the loftiest parts of the dissected Allegheny Plateau. At a little less than 3400 feet (1037 m) elevation, this valley is high enough to ensure a cool climate, but supplementary cold air draining from surrounding mountains that rise above 4500 feet (1373 m), give it a climate comparable to that of northern New England or adjacent Canada. In some years the frost-free preiod has been as short as 81 days (Core, 1955).<br><dd>
The Glades take their name from the cranberries, both Large (<i>Vaccinium macrocarpon</i>) and Small (<i>V. oxycoccos</i>), that thrive there. They are drained by the Cranberry River, which has its headwaters on the slopes above. Although the Glades, with their numerous rare and disjunct northern and other species, have long been the focus of attention, they are integrally related to the rocks, soils and forests of the surrounding slopes and these have received little attention.An attempt is made here to study the bordering upland forests in some detail. <br><dd>
Among outstanding previous studies of the Glades and their physical environment are those of Darlington (1943), Strausbaugh (1934) and Core (1955). Brooks (1930, 1934 and 1945) made extensive studies of the Glades' birds. Core (1955) has provided an extensive bibliography of other early research.<br><dd>
Darlignton showed that the valley flat occupied by the Glades resulted from easily erodable rocks in the basin and more resistant rock at its lower end, effectively preventing down-cutting and thus maintaining a low gradient in the valley. These circumstances resulted in an elevation of 3400 feet (1039 m) at the upper end and 3350 feet (1022 m) at the lower, thus 
eliminating the possibility of origin by water impoundment.<br><dd>
Although much of the Glades is underlain by peat- up to 10 feet (1 m) thick in places - the peat is in turn underlain by algal ooze and the ooze by marl, according to Darlington. Since marlis a calcareous sediment, a limestone source in the surrounding rocks is indicated. An ample source appears to be present in the underlying Hinton Formation, a circumstance that also has important implications for the Glades' flora.<br><dd>
The geological history of the Glades has been traced back at least 12,200 years before the present, when apparently, a forest of conifer- northern hardwoods replaced tundra (Watts, 1979).

<b>The Glades<ul>

<dd>

</b><i>(Much of the  general information of this section is taken from Core (1955), but is supplemented by our own observations.)</i><br><dd>
The Glades wetland complex consists of three major habitats: swamp forest, shrub swamp and open grass/sedge/forb meadow and bog. Open water habitat is provided by the Cranberry River and a number of Beaver ponds but is minor.Shrub swamp covers about 400 acres (160 ha), swamp forest 200 acres (80 ha) and open glade about about 120 acres (48 ha). Open glades are comprised of Big Glade (60 acres/24 ha), Flag Glade (28 acres/11.2 ha), Long Glade (20 acres/8 ha), Round Glade (8 acres/3.2 ha) and Little Glade (2 acres/0.8 ha). These glades are separated by the Cranberry River and its branches, Yew and Charles Creeks. This drainage pattern probably plays a critical role in determining the chemical characteristics and floristics of the complex. Equally significant is the presence of the Hinton Formation, which not only underlies the glade complex, but also occupies much of its watershed. The presence of carbonate rocks in this formation no doubt contributes greatly to the floral and faunal diversity and luxuriance of the area.<br>

In keeping with the cool climate of the Glades, the number of canopy tree species is not large. Predominant are Red Spruce, Canada Hemlock, Yellow Birch and Red Maple, with minor Black Ash (<i>Fraxinus  nigra</i>) and Pitch Pine. Upland forests immediately surrounding the wetlands are also dominated by the first four of these species but also contain Beech, Sugar Maple, Black Cherry, American Basswood, White Ash, Yellow Buckeye, Black Birch, Cucumber and Fraser Magnolias, a little White Oak and possibly a few other species. Big-tooth and Trembling Aspens (<i>Populus  grandidentata</i> and <i>P.  tremuloides</i>), Smooth Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier  laevis</i>), Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya  virginiana</i>), Striped and Mountain Maples (<i>Acer  pensylvanicum</i> and <i>A. spicatum</i>), Dotted Thorn (<i>Crataegus  punctata</i>), Mountain Ash (<i>Sorbus  americana</i>), Fire and Choke Cherries (<i>Prunus  pensylvanica</i>  and <i>P. virginiana</i>) and Staghorn Sumac (<i>Rhus  typhina</i>) are minor and understory trees.<br><dd>
In contrast to trees, shrubs show considerable diversity. This is in part a consequence of their presence not only in shrub swamps but also in all forest habitats and in open glades as well. Most common is Speckled Alder (<i>Alnus rugosa</i>), the dominant of shrub swamps. Also common are Pipestem (<i>Spiraea alba</i>), Glade St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum  densiflorum</i>), Great Rhododendron (<i> Rhododendron  maximum</i>), Hobblebush (<i>Viburnum</i> <i>alnifolium</i>), Smooth Arrowwood (<i>V.  recognitum</i>), Roughish Arrowwood (<i>V</i>. <i>dentatum</i>), Wild Raisin (<i>V. cassinoides</i>), the rare northern disjunct Oblong-fruited Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier  bartramiana</i>), here at its southern limit, Ninebark (<i> Physocarpus  opulifolius</i>), Alternate-leaved Dogwood (Cornus  <i>alternifolia</i>), Bunchberry (<i>C.  canadensis</i>), Winterberry Holly (<i>Ilex</i>  <i>verticillata</i>), Mountain Holly (<i>I. montana</i>), the Appalachian endemic Long-stalked Holly (<i>I.  collina</i>  or <i>Nemopanthus collina</i>), Swamp Rose (<i>Rosa</i>  <i>palustris</i>), the rare northern disjunct Bog Rosemary (<i>Andromeda</i> <i>glaucophylla</i>), also at its southern limit of distribution, Smooth Gooseberry (<i>Ribes  rotundifolia</i>), Skunk Currant (<i>R.  glandulosum</i>), Black Chokeberry (<i>Aronia  melanocarpa</i>), Spice Bush (<i>Lindera  benzoin</i>), Large and Small Cranberries as mentioned earlier, Southern Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium</i>  <i>erythrocarpum</i>), Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia  latifolia</i>), Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia</i>  <i>pilosa</i>), Canada Yew (<i>Taxus  canadensis</i>), Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i>), Silky Willow (<i>Salix sericea</i>), Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus  canadensis</i>), Red Elderberry (<i>S.  pubens</i>), Beaked Hazelnut (<i>Corylus  cornuta</i>), Wild Hydrangea (<i> Hydrangea  arborescens</i>), Groundberry (<i>Rubus  hispidus</i>), Thornless Blackberry (<i>R.  canadensis</i>) and other species of <i>Rubus</i>.<br><dd>
More than ten of these shrubs have markedly northern distributions and at least three are at their extreme southern limits. Canada Yew deserves special mention. This evergreen shrub was once very common in the region; enough so to have the Yew Mountains and Yew Creek named after it. However in recent decades Deer browsing has reduced its numbers to the extent that it is found onlyat scattered locations throughout its Central Appalachian range.<br><dd>
The Glades are also rich in disjunct northern herbs, some rare. These include the following:<p>
Oak Fern (<i>Dryopteris  disjuncta</i>)<br>
Blue Joint (<i>Calamagrostis  canadensis</i>)<br>
Drooping Wood Reedgrass (<i>Cinna latifolia</i>)<br>
Millet Grass (<i> Milium  effusum</i>)<br>
Rattlesnake Mannagrass (<i>Glyceria  canadensis</i>)<br>
a sedge (<i>Carex  trisperma</i>)<br>
Interior Sedge (<i>C. interior</i>)<br>
Pod Grass (<i>Scheuchzeria  palustris</i>)<br>
Yellow Clintonia (<i>Clintonia  borealis</i>)<br>
Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum  canadense</i>)<br>
White Hellebore (<i>Veratrum  viride</i>)<br>
Northern Coralroot (<i>Corallorhiza  trifida</i>)<br>
Lesser Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera  repens</i>)<br>
Mountain Bindweed (<i>Polygonum  cilinode</i>)<br>
Marsh Marigold (<i> Caltha  palustis</i>)<br>
Goldthread (<i>Coptis  groenlandica</i>)<br>
Swamp Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga  pensylvanica</i>)<br>
White Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis montana</i>)<br>
Northern White Violet (<i>Viola  pallens</i>)<br>
Buckbean (<i>Menyanthes  trifoliata</i>)<p><dd>
Pod Grass was collected here in 1909. It is so rare that a team of five botanists searched for it on August 10, 1990, the same day of the month on which it was originally collected, but could not find it (McDonald, 1993).<br><dd>
Other rare herbs of more southern distribution are Frasers Sedge (<i>Cymophyllus  fraseri</i>) and Jacobs Ladder (<i>Polemonium  van- bruntiae</i>).<br><dd>
One of the most common sedges of the open meadows and bogs is <i>Carex  utriculata</i> (or <i>C.  rostrata </i> var <i>utriculata</i>), but the previously- mentioned <i>C.  trisperma</i> and <i>C.  interior</i>  as well as nomerous other species occur in various Glade habitats. Most conspicuous however, are Cotton Sedge (<i>Eriophorum  virginicum</i>), with its ball of cottony light- colored bristles and Beaked Rush (<i> Rhynchospora  alba</i>) by virtue of its white spikelets. These sedges are most frequently in association with the cranberries, Groundberry, <i>Sphagnum</i>moss and other low plants. Towering above these as well as the taller sedges are large clumps of Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>).<br><dd>
As in most bogs, an important role is played by mosses and most particularily the <i>Sphagnum</i>s. These include <i>S.  capillaceum</i>, <i>S.  tenellum, S.</i> <i>palustris, S.  recurvum</i>, <i>S.  magellanicum</i>, <i>S.  imbricatum</i>, <i>S. squarosum</i> and <i>S</i>.  <i>girgensohnii</i>. In some places however, these are replaced by the haircap mosses <i>Polytrichum  juniperinum</i>, <i>P.  commune</i>  and <i>P.  ohioense</i>  as well as the &quot;reindeer moss&quot; lichens <i>Cladina  rangiferina</i>  and <i>C.  tenuis</i>. While the <i>Sphagnum</i>s usually occupy depressions or level areas, the haircaps frequent elevated hummocks. Bog Rosemary is found with a <i>Polytrichum- Cladina</i> association in Big Glade.<br><dd>
Additional herbs, largely of wider occurrence, that are found here, are the following:<p>
Crested Fern (<i>Dryopteris  cristata</i>)<br>
Boott's Fern (<i>D.  boottii</i>) <br>
Sedges  <ul><i>Carex  baileyi</i><br>
  <i>C.  flexuosa</i> <br>
  <i>C.  prasina<br>
  C.  scoparia<br>
  C.  stipata</i><br></uL>
  <i>Scirpus  cyperinus</i><br>
Sweet Vernal Grass (<i>Anthoxanthum  odoratum</i>)<br>
Hairgrass (<i>Agrostis  hyemalis</i>)<br>
Autumn Bent (<i>A.  perennans</i>)<br>
Hairy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum  lanuginosum</i>)<br>
a panic grass (<i>P.  latifolius</i>)<br>
a wood rush (<i>Luzula  carolinae </i> var<i> saltuensis</i>)<br>
Grass Pink (<i>Calopogon  pulchellus</i>)<br>
Small Green Wood Orchid (<i>Habenaria  clavellata</i>)<br>
Beard Flower (<i> Pogonia ophioglossoides</i>)<br>
Carolina Spring Beauty (<i>Claytonia  caroliniana</i>)<br>
Tasslerue (<i>Trautvetteria  caroliniensis</i>)<br>
Sundew (<i>Drosera  rotundifolia</i>)<br>
Barren Strawberry (<i>Waldsteinia fragarioides</i>)<br>
Water Parsnip (<i>Sium  suave</i>)<br>
Musk Flower (<i>Mimulus  moschatus</i>)<br>
<p>
These lists still fall far short of all plant species of the Glades and their vicinity. Many others are presented in our inventories.<br>

<dd>
</b>Our early August visit consisted of three inventories. The first of these, on the afternoon of 8-5-98, took the form of a short traverse up- slope in the upland forest immediately soutwest of the Botanical Area parking lot. The second, on the evening of the same day, occurred on a short section of the western end of the Cow Pasture Trail on the Cranberry River flood plain, while the third, on the follow ing morning, occurred along the Botanical Area  boardwalk. Our nights were spent at the turn-around on Forest Road 102 a mile northwest of the Botanical Area. The weather during this visit was clear, warm and dry for the most part, but with heavy morning dews.<br><dd>
Our 8-5-98 traverse into the upland forest extended not much farther than 400 feet (120 m) from the parking lot to an old woods road. The lower part was over a gentle slope cut by gullies and temporary and intermittant streams or sprinbrooks. Vegetation appeared to be closely related to this topography with strongly acidiphile species occupying convexities and less strongly acidiphile to circumneutral- ranging species the concavities. As the general slope steepened near the traverse end, conditions appeared to become more eutrophic in response to colluvial processes.<br><dd>
The initial canopy was dominated by Hemlock up to 28 inches (0.7 m) dbh or greater. Co- dominants were Red Spruce, Black Cherry of good form, Beech and Yellow Birch, perhaps in part reflecting the northeast aspect. Striped Maple and Red Spruce saplings formed an understory and a little Hobblebush a thin shrub layer.<br><dd>
Herbs, largely on convexities, were dominated by Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris  intermedia</i>), White wood Sorrel and Tree and Shining Clubmosses (<i>Lycopodium  obscurum</i>  and <i>L. lucidulum</i>). Less common were Painted Trillium (<i>Trillium  undulatum</i>), Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana</i>), Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium  purpureum</i>), Northern White Violet in a seepy area, Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>), Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella  repens</i>), Canada Mayflower, Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>), Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina  racemosa</i>), Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<i> Goodyera  pubescens</i>) and the acidiphile and moisture-loving sedge <i>Carex  intumescens</i>.<br><dd>
Fungi identified were <i>Hypomyces  hyalinus</i>, parasitic on an <i>Amanita</i>, the Hoof Fungus (<i>Fomes  fomentarius</i>) on Yellow Birch, the edible <i>Laccaria</i> <i>ochropurpurea</i>  and <i>Cantherellus  ignicolor</i>  on soil. The mosses <i>Ulota crispa</i> and a species of <i>Dicranum</i>  encrusted apparently healthy Beech, while an unidentified <i>Hypnum </i> occupied large woody debris. <br><dd>
Moving up-slope, we saw seedlings of Fraser Magnolia and Red Maple, the fungus <i>Amanita  vaginata</i>  on soil and Carbon Cushion (<i>Ustulina deusta</i>) on a dead snag of Black Cherry; then Foam Flower (<i>Tiarella  cordifolia</i>), New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris  noveboracensis</i>), the fungus <i>Laccaria  laccata</i> on soil, Yellow Clintonia, Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia  sessilifolia</i>) and a species of the fungus <i>Russula</i>. Here we also began to see Sugar Maple seedlings, Black Cohosh (<i> Cimicifuga  racemosa</i>), the fungus<i> Ganoderma applanatus</i>, followed by a fairly large (one inch/2.5 cm) shell of a land snail, then more Black Cohosh, Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea  quaternata</i>), the fungi <i>Trichaptum  biformis</i>  on Beech and a species of <i>Clitocybe.</i> Here we also noted a 21 inch (0.53 m) dbh Beech with apparently healed cracks, a large Basswood (likely <i>Tillia  americana</i>) and White Ash.<br><dd>
Our traverse now encountered a gully or shallow ravine with a rich cover of herbs. Seen along the bottom and sides were Ramps (<i>Allium</i> <i>tricoccum</i>), White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium  rugosum</i>), Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum lanuginosum</i>), Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea  canadensis</i>), Round-lobed Hepatica (<i>Hepatica  americana</i>), Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola  blanda</i>), Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium  triflorum</i>), Honewort (<i> Cryptotaenia  canadensis</i>), Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca  obtusa</i>), Hispid Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus  hispidus</i>), luxuriant <i>Carex  scabrata</i>, Round-leaf Violet (<i>Viola  rotundifolia</i>), a Gall of the Earth (<i>Prenanthes</i>  sp), Silvery Glade Fern (<i>Athyrium  thelypterioides</i>), Sugar Maple saplings,<i>Carex  prasina, C. laxiflora</i>, a little Wild Ginger (<i>Asarum</i>  <i>canadense</i>), a Trillium (likely <i>T. erectum</i>), Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum</i>  <i>thalictroides</i>), Wild Blue Phlox (<i>Phlox  divaricata</i>), the eutrophic indicator <i>Carex  plantaginea</i>, Hooked Crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus recurvatus</i>) and a Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens </i> sp). A reading taken on 8-24-98 next to a plant of <i>Carex  plantaginea</i>  gave a pH of 5.0. The floral difference between this community and that of the topographic convexities is obvious, although it too is at least somewhat acid-tollerant.<br><dd>
Bryophytes too were generally abundant throughout both habitats, on down wood, rocks, tree bases and extending up trunks. A microscopic examination by R. Hunsucker of these bryophytes yielded the following list of species, in which liverworts are explicitly indicated, while mosses constitute the rest.<p>
<i>Anomodon  attenuatus</i>- on soil, bases of trees<br>
<i>A.  minor</i>- on lower trunks and bases of trees and on rotting down <b><br>
</b> boles<br>
<i>A.  rostratus</i>- on bases of trees, soil<br>
<i>Atrichum  undulatum</i>- on soil, humus<br>
<i>Aulocomnium  heterostichum</i>- 0n soil and bases of trees<br>
<i>Brachythecium</i>  sp- on rotting wood<br>
<i>Brotherella  recurvans</i>- on base of rotting Yellow Birch snags and <br>
  stumps<br>
<i>Campylium  chrysophyllum</i>- on soil and humus<br>
<i>Chiloscyphus  profundus</i>- a liverwort 0m moist soil, humus and rotting <br>
  wood<br>
<i>Dicranella  heteromalla</i>- on open disturbed places<br>
<i>D.  montanum</i>- on rotting wood and lower trunks of dead trees<br>
<i>D.  scoparium</i>- on humus and soil<br>
<i>D.</i>  sp- on soil<br>
<i>Frullania  asagrayana</i>- a liverwort on bark of deciduous trees<br>
<i>Hypnum  curvifolium</i>- on boulders, rotting fallen trees<br>
<i>H.  pallescens</i>- on decaying fallen trees<br>
<i>Isopterygium tenerum</i> - on rotting fallen trees and soil<br>
<i>Leucobryum  albidum</i>- on rotting fallen trees and soil<br>
<i>Mnium  affine</i>  var <i>ciliare</i>  on moist rotting wood, rocks and humus<br>
<i>M.  punctatum</i>  var <i>punctatum</i>- on rocks in stream or on wet substrate <br>
<i>Nowellia  curvifolia</i>- a liverwort on rotting moist fallen tree trunks<br>
<i>Plagiochila  asplenioides</i>- a liverwort on moist soil and rocks <br>
<i>Plagiothecium  cavifolium</i>- on rotting Yellow Birch stumps and boles<br>
<i>Thuidium  delicatulum</i> var <i>delicatulum</i>- on a variety of substrates:<br>
  Rocks, soil, decaying wood and bases of trees<br>
<i>Taxiphyllum  deplanatum</i>- on rotting wood<br>
<i>Tetraphis  pellucida</i>-on rotting wood
<p>
The most conspicuous and determined fauna here was mosquitoes.<p>
Farther up the rapidly- steepening slope we noted <i>Carex  gracillima</i>, Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium  virginianum</i>), the fungi <i>Tremellodendron  pallidum</i>  on soil and<i> Tricholomopsis  platyphylla</i>  on wood, Broad-leaved Waterleaf (<i> Hydrophyllum  canadense</i>), Broad-leaved Goldenrod (<i>Solidago</i> <i>flexicaulis</i>), Miterwort (<i>Mitella  diphylla</i>), Crooked-stem Aster (<i>Aster</i> <i>prenanthoides</i>) and Clustered Snakeroot (<i>Sanicula  gregaria</i>). The base of a steep slope, occupied by a 3 foot (0.9 m) dbh Sugar Maple, was covered by abundant Blue Cohosh and <i>Carex  plantaginea</i>, in keeping with the floral enrichment expected from colluvial processes here.<br><dd>
The old woods road occupied the slope above the big Sugar Maple. Here were more Ramps, Christmas Fern (<i>Polytrichum  acrostichoides</i>). Heart-leaved Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria  ovata</i>), Bottlebrush Grass (<i>Elymus hystrix</i>), a manna grass (<i>Glyceria</i>  sp), Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio  aureus</i>), Thornless Blackberry and the fungi <i>Xeromphalina  kaufmannii </i> and <i>Rickenella fibula</i>. A determination of soil pH of the upper road bank on our 9-8-98 visit yielded values in the range of 4.5 to 5.0. Although this value may indicate more than average vertical leaching for the sample, it showsthat, despite the floral diversity, the regime is a quite acidic one.<br><dd>
Our second inventory, on the evening of 8-5-98, began in essentially swamp forest which occurs on both sides of FR-102 leading to the Cow Pasture Trailhead.It is by and large quite young and trees generally did not exceed one foot (0.3 m) dbh. The canopy is dominated by Hemlock and Red Spruce with subordinate Yellow Birch and Red Maple. Great Rhododendron is present, although this forest is quite open. The Sweet Tooth mushroom (<i>Hydnum  repandum</i>) was collected to add to our evening meal.<br><dd>
On entering the Cow Pasture Trail, the forest is similar to that described above, except for details. Successively noted were the liverwort <i>Bazzania trilobata</i>on tree bases, seedlings of Fraser Magnolia, Mountain Ash, six-inch (15 cm) fish in a trail-side ditch, abundant New York Fern, the manna grasses <i>Glyceria  striata</i>  and <i>G.  melicaria</i>, Great Rhododendron on the ditch bank with Intermediate Shield Fern, the call of a Hermit Thrush (<i>Catharus  guttata</i>), an Amanita fungus, Foam Flower, unidentified species of <i>Atrichum</i>  and <i>Mnium</i>mosses, then canada Mayflower, Blue Monkshood (<i>Aconitum  uncinatum</i>), seedlings of Beech, Partridge Berry and six inch  high Spruce and Hemlock seedlings.<br><dd>
We had now reached the edge of the alder swamp that forms a narrow fringe along the Cranberry River and represents the attenuated northwest arm of the Glades. Here, among the Speckled Alder,was New York Fern, the wedge grass <i>Sphenopholis  pensylvanica</i>, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa</i>) only beginning to bloom, Cowbane (<i>Oxypolis  rigidior</i>) already in bloom,as was also the spectacular tall phlox, <i>Phlox  glaberrina</i>. In attendance on the latter's red-purple flowers were numerous Tiger Swallowtails (<i>Papilio glaucus</i>) Butterflies.<br><dd>
Moving farther into the open, we saw Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda  claytoniana</i>), Dotted St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum  dentatum</i>), the tall sedge <i>Carex gynandra</i>, Flat-top White Aster (<i>Aster  umbellatus</i>), beginning to bloom, Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed, <i>Carex  lurida</i>, White Hellebore already in decay, Grass-leaved Goldenrod (<i>Euthamia graminifolia</i>), the wild rye grasses <i>Elymus riparius</i> and<i> E. virginicus</i> and Golden Ragwort.<br><dd>
Now reaching a small stream crossing, we saw more <i>Phlox  glaberrima</i> in bloom, Spotted Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens  capensis</i>) also in bloom, shrubs of Black Elderberry, Leather-leaf Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum  coriaceum</i>), Steel's Meadowrue (<i>T.  steeleanum</i>), Wood Reed Grass (<i>Cinna  arundinacea</i>), Oswego Tea (<i>Monarda  didyma</i>) in bloom with butterflies in attendance and Deertongue Grass (<i>Panicum  clandestinum</i>), while in the stream were Small Burreed (<i>Sparganium  chlorocarpon</i>) and Grassy Pondweed (<i>Potamogeton  gramineus</i>).<br><dd>
A little beyond this stream a large blue-black wasp with bright yellow antennae was active, as were Red-spotted Purple (<i>Limenitis  arthemis</i>  <i>astyanax </i>) butterflies. Here we also saw the manna grass <i>Glyceria  grandis</i>, a heavily-browsed, rather glaberous, Arrowwood Viburnum, and on the elevated trail-side bank, Choke Cherry, which was also heavily browsed. These were accompanied by Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis  stricta</i>), Wild Lettuce (<i>Lactuca  canadensis</i>), a patch of rather stunted Blue Joint Grass and an unidentified lily (<i>Lilium</i>  sp).<br><dd>
We had now reached the main channel of the Cranberry River, here about ten feet (3 m) wide and a meter deep. The pH of River water here was measured at 5.5.<br><dd>
An extraordinarily dense growth of herbs occupied an opening at the stream edge. Here was Rice Cutgrass (<i>Leersia  oryzoides</i>), Rough Bedstraw (<i>Galium asprellum</i>) in bloom, Mad-dog Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria  lateriflora</i>), tall, large- panicled Fowl Bluegrass (<i>Poa  palustris</i>), Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus  uniflorus</i>), Water Smartweed (<i>Polygonum  punctatum</i>), Arrow-leaf Tearthumb (<i>P. sagittatum</i>), an unidentified Gentian (<i>Gentiana</i>  sp) and Fringed Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia  ciliata</i>). Also noted were numerous non-biting flies and the Eastern Tailed Blue (<i>Everes  comyntas</i>) Butterfly. <br><dd>
Not far beyond the River channel lay the edge of the upland forest. Here we terminated our traverse, but not before noting the presence of a layer of Ground Berry at the forest edge. We will return to a nearby part of the Cow Pasture Trail in our inventory of 9-9-98.<br><dd>
Our third inventory of this visit, that of the morning of 8-6-98, occurred during a brief clockwise traverse of the Botanical Area boardwalk. Passing first through a section of swamp forest, we noted in succession the following: a Hemlock, Red Spruce and Yellow Birch canopy of mixed age, Black Elderberry, Spotted Jewelweed,  Black Cohosh, Oswego Tea, Thornless Blackberry, Abundant Carex plantaginea, Wood Nettle, Great Rhododendron, unidentified birds and their calls, Downy Wood Violet, Mountain Ash, Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed, Foam Flower, Mountain Fern Moss (<i>Hylocomium splendens</i>), the manna grass <i>Glyceria melicaria</i>, very abundant Sensitive Fern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>), Marsh Marigold, a large <i>Mnium</i>  moss (likely <i>Mnium punctatum</i>) in a wet area, Canada Mayflower and a Yellow Clintonia.Coming then to  the edge of the open glade we saw Cinnamon Fern, Cowbane in bloom, Speckled Alder, Tall Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum  pubescens</i>), abundant Purple-stem Aster (<i>Aster  puniceus</i>), some with a white mold covering the leaves, Winterberry Holly, Purple-leaved Willow Herb (<i>Epilobium  coloratum</i>) in bloom, seedlings of Red Maple, Wild Raisin, Smooth Serviceberry, Hispid Greenbrier (<i>Smilax  hispida</i>), Southern Mountain Cranberry, Rice Cutgrass and a few patches of <i>Sphagnum</i>  moss.<br><dd>
We now reached the edge of a sedge meadow dominated by <i>Carex utriculata</i>, with abundant Cotton Sedge and Beaked Rush, as well as Swamp Candles (<i>Lysimachia  terrestris</i>), with vegetative bulbs in its leaf axils, Arrowleaf Tearthumb and more Spotted Jewelweed. The sedge meadow gradually gave way to bog with mostly lower plants, including cranberries, numerous seedlings of Black Chokeberry, Marsh St. Johns-wort (<i>Triodenum fraseri</i> or <i>Hypericum  virginicum</i>), still abundant Beaked Rush and Cotton Sedge, the rush <i>Juncus subcaudatus</i>,  Yellow Bartonia (<i>Bartonia  virginica</i>),  a little <i>Glyceria  Grandis</i>,  Three-way Sedge (<i>Dulichium  arundinaceum</i>) and Autumn Bent Grass. Also, small white lepidoptera were seen here. A pH determination of the organic matter immediately below cranberries on 9-8-98 fell in the range of 4.0 to 4.5.<br><dd>
As we again entered the swamp forest we saw Claytons Bedstraw (<i>Galium  tinctorium</i>), Blue Monkshood, <i>Phlox  glaberrima </i> and Turtlehead (<i>Chelone  glabra</i>), all in fullbloom, and marveled at the subtle complexity as well as the beauty of the Monkshood flower. Also present here was Skunk Cabbage (<i>Symplocarpus  foetidus</i>) past its prime, Crooked-stem Aster in bloom, Sundew (<i>Drosera  rotundifolia</i>) also in bloom, Clammy Hedge Hyssop (<i>Gratiola  neglecta</i>), a little Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia  nudicaulis</i>), Oblong-fruited Serviceberry, Long-stalked Holly and Spice Bush, as well as the Spice Bush Swallowtail (<i>Papilio  troilus</i>) Butterfly. A Green Frog (<i>Rana  clamitans</i>) was heard calling as we ended our traverse in the vicinity of a large Yellow Birch, a tree signed to be near 300 years in age. <br><dd>
Our visit to the Glades on 8-24-98 to 8-26-98 occurred during a warm spell, with maximum temperatures generally in the 70s to 80s degree F (20 to 25 degree C). It was quite dry, with light winds, usually a few high clouds and heavy morning dew. Birds seen at our camp were House Wrens (<i>Troglodytes  aedon</i>) during early mornings, Chickadees, probably Black-capped (<i>Parus  atricapillus</i>), with unidentified vireos and thrushes sounding from the forest. Bats were present each evening, and on that of 9-24-98 R. Hunsucker, with great skill, captured and described a Common Stonefly (<i>Perlidae</i>) that had entertained us with its acrobatics before alighting nearby. Also seen during the day here was a Ruby-throated Hummingbird (<i>Archilochus colubris</i>) and a Red Admiral (<i> Vanessa  alalanta</i>) Butterfly.<br><dd>
Measurements were also made of the pH of Yew Creek and  of that of a springbrook that issues from the adjacent upland forest.These measurements yielded values of 5.5 and 5.0 respectively. Red clay from a bank immediately under a <i>Polytrichum</i>  mat in association with Common Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium  clavatum</i>), Creeping Five-leaf and Red Spruce had a pH of 4.3 while organic soil under Hemlock in the adjacent upland forest had a similar value.<br><dd>
On the morning of 8-25-98 we began a traverse up Kennison Mountain, a ridge that borders the Glades on the soutwest. Our traverse follwed the Pocahontas Trail and consisted of six legs,extending from the traihead on Route 39, at an elevation of 3560 feet (1086 m), to the summit at 4080 feet (1244 m) asl. Deviating from the Glades norm, the weather during this traverse was cool and pleasant, with light wind. Species and terrain features are listed in the order in which they were observed and scientific names are, with few exceptions, given for species not previously encountered or mentioned.<br><dd>
The first leg of our traverse essentially followed the 3600 (1098 m) contour southeast for about 0.5 mile (0.8 km). The canopy at the start consisted of Hemlock, Beech, yellow and Black Birches, Red Maple, Black Cherry of good form, White Ash, Northern Red Oak and a few American Basswood. The understory was dominated by Striped Maple, with some Hophornbeam and a few Red Spruce saplings. Although there were few shrubs, Hobblebush and Beaked Hazelnut were present. Intermediate Shield Fern was abundant, as was Shining Clubmoss and Partridge Berry. Other herbs were Round-leaf Violet, <i>Carex  debilis</i>,  Pink Ladyslipper (<i>Cypripedium</i> <i>acaule</i>), White Wood Sorrel, <i>Medeola</i>, Tree Clubmoss, New York Fern and Large Round-leaf Orchis (<i>Habenaria  orbiculata</i>), all in all a strongly acidiphile community.<br><dd>
Associated fungi were <i>Scleroderma  citrinum</i>, <i>Collybia  confluens</i>, <i>Entoloma  salmoneum</i>, <i>Xerula  furfuracea</i>  with its deep root, Turkey Tail (<i>Trametes  versicolor</i>), the Ash Bolete (<i>Gyrodon  merulioides</i>), common in the vicinity of White Ash, and undetermined species of <i>Russula</i>  and<i> Psathyrella</i>. <br><dd>
The foregoing herbs characterized local convexities, while the flora of the ravine sides and bottoms was much richer and more diverse. Included in the latter were <i>Carex  plantaginea</i>, Sessile-leaved Bellwort, Wood Nettle, Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago  curtisii</i>), Lettuce Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga</i> <i>micranthidifolia</i>), Ramps, Drooping Wood Reed Grass, Christmas Fern, <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, Honewort, Virginia Strawberry (<i>Fragaria virginica</i>), <i>Carex  scabrata</i>, Downy Wood Volet, Sweet White Violet, Hooked Crowfoot, Foam Flower, Nodding Fescue, White Snakeroot and Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed.<br><dd>
Farther along the leg, and mostly on an upland slope, we saw the liverwort <i>Nowellia  curvifolia</i>  in its characteristic habitat on a rotting down bole, the fungus <i>Daedaliopsis  confragosa</i>, Thornless Blackberry, Mountain Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia  compressa</i>) at the trail-side, a Clintonia (likely <i>Clintonia borealis</i>), Hairy Disporum, <i>Leucobryum</i>  moss; then the first seedlings of Sugar Maple, followed by Hispid greenbrier, the wood rush <i>Luzula acuminata</i>, Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria  pubera</i>), abundant Shining Clubmoss, Painted Trillium, Filmy Angelica (<i>Angelica  triquinata</i>), Witch Hazel, <i>Glyceria  melicaria</i>, Canada Mayflower and Silvery Glade Fern. Associated mosses were Delicate Fern Moss, species of <i>Dicranum, Mnium</i>  and, particularily on down boles, <i>Hypnum</i>.<br><dd>
Next seen were Autumn Bent Grass, seedlings of Fraser Magnolia, Carex laxiflora, Black-capped Chickadee and Wild Blue Phlox.<br><dd>
We now arrived at a sprinbrook ravine with abundant <i>Carex</i>  <i>plantaginea</i>, Tall White Lettuce (<i>Prenanthes  altissima</i>) coming into bloom, Blue Cohosh with fruit,<i>Glyceria  striata</i>  and Hairy-jointed Meadow Parsnip. Here also Sugar Maple came into prominence, with Cucumbertree and White Ash, and the latter accompanied by Ash Bolete. Beginning here there was a relatively enriched slope on which the most demanding species were no longer confined to topographic cocavities. Along this slope we saw Wake Robin (<i>Trillium  erectum</i>), the first Bitternut Hickory (<i>Carya  cordiformis</i>) bearing the moss <i>Neckera  pennata</i>, Hoof Fungus, American Basswood, quite large Northern Red Oak, Black Birch, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Sweet White Violet and, in an unusual association, the ordinarily calciphile Sharp-lobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica  acutiloba</i>) in close association with the acidiphiles Canada Mayflower and White wood Sorrel.Also seen in the vicinity were Dog Lichen (<i>Pelligera  canina</i>), the fungus <i>Mycena  haematopus</i>  on oak, Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium  virginianum</i>), Dutchman's Pipe vine (<i>Aristolochia  macrophylla</i>), Pinesap (<i>Monotropa  hypopithys</i>), a species of the liverwort <i>Frullania</i>  on Black Birch and <i>Carex gracillima</i>.<br><dd>
Reaching another small ravine, we saw BlackCohosh, Ramps, Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium filix-femina</i>), Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa  bracteata</i>) in its only appearance, abundant Sugar Maple, the Chaga Fungus (<i>Inonotus  obliquus</i>) on Black Birch, Oyster Mushroom (<i>Pleurotus  ostreatus</i>) and Wild Geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>). The soil here was a reddish loam.<br><dd>
Now approaching the end of the leg, we entered an area with many Northern Red Oak in excess of two feet (0.6 m) dbh, with smaller Sugar Maple, the first noted Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacea), Carrion Flower (Smilax herbacea), Brachyelytrum erectum and the fungus Tricholomopsis platyphylla.<br><dd>
At this point the trail turned sharply right on the second leg of our traverse. Here were numerous Sugar Maples of various size classes, the first noted Pallid Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens  pallida</i>) in bloom, the bullrush <i>Scirpus  atrovirens</i>, the acidiphile sedge <i>Carex  intumescens</i>  and Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed, also in bloom, but showing few of the characteristics of this plant, such as purple nodes and stems.Also present here was the fungus <i>Trichaptum  biforme</i>  on down wood.<br><dd>
Advancing along the second leg we saw Plume Lily, Downy Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum  pubescens</i>), the fungus <i>Clitocybe  gibba</i>, Red Elderberry in its first appearance, seedlings of Bitternut Hickory and Four-leaved yam.<br><dd>
At 3760 feet (1147 m) asl we arrived at a sharp left turn in the trail and the third leg of our traverse. This leg again rather closely approximated the contour, initially passing through dryer forest than that below. Here were large Northern Red Oak and smaller Beech, while New York Fern and Four-leaved Yam formed a sparce ground cover and imparted a sense of both northern and southern floras. In one place a large cluster of Jack-O- Lantern mushrooms (<i>Omphalotus  olearius</i>) on a stump attracted our attention. Subsequently the adjacent slope steepened,exposing a reddish soil and a more luxuriant flora. Sugar Maple dominated the canopy and fallen wood contained a striking example of the edible tooth fungus <i>Hericium</i> <i>americanum</i>.. While the forest here was open and relatively free of shrubs and small trees, herbs abounded. Included were Clustered Snakeroot, Blue Cohosh and Wood Nettle, with the latter heavily invested by the Appalachian endemic, Beaked Dodder (<i>Cuscuta  rostrata</i>). Ahead the impression of richness was sustained by the presence of Large-flowered Bellwort (<i>Uvularia  grandiflora</i>), one of the most demanding herbs, a dense stand of Ramps and Wild Blue Phlox. Only a single plant of May Apple (<i> Podophyllum  peltatum</i>) was seen however.<br><dd>
Associated fungi were<i> Russula  fragrantissima</i>, with its distinctive odor, <i>Mycena  leaiana</i>  and the edible <i>Pholiota  squarrosoides</i>, all characteristic of northern hardwood forest (Phillips, 1991).<br><dd>
Continuing through this forest type, we saw Canada Violet (<i>Viola canadensis</i>) and Broad-leaf Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum  canadense</i>) as we approached a sharp right turn in the trail at almost 3800 feet (1159 m) asl. Here our fourth leg of the traverse began by our seeing a four inch (10 cm) millipede, dark in color, with red stripes, on the trunk of a Sugar Maple.Following were abundant Hairy Disporum and the fungus <i>Crepidotus  mollis</i>, a species also characteristic of deciduous woods. We then again entered a less rich forest, noting the fungus<i> Russula  compacta</i>, with its strong fishy odor, and that most of ground flora had been left behind. However we did see Dutchman's Pipe vine,  the Pipe Vine Swallowtail (<i>Papilio  philenas</i>) Butterfly and the first Mountain Aster (<i>Aster  acuminatus</i>).<br><dd>
The fifth leg of our traverse began with a sharp left turn in the trail at 3960 feet (1208 m) asl. The soil here was light colored and sandy and the forest quite dry, with a canopy of Beech and Northern Red Oak. Among the ground flora was abundant <i>Brachyelytrum  erectum</i> and Black Cohosh in bloom- months later than that 2000 feet lower and likely at the clmatic limit for the species. Also seen on the trail here here was a dead shrew (<i>Sorex</i>  sp) .<br><dd>
We soon reached a sharp right turn at the 4000 foot (1220 m) level and were greeted by a small group of Juncos (<i>Junco  hyemalis</i>) under a Beech- Sugar Maple canopy. Striped Maple was abundant and there were fire scars on the Beech. Fungi noted were <i>Hygrophorus  aurantiaca</i>  on soil and <i>Phelimus  rimosus</i>  on the Beech.<br><dd>
Now continuing on a gentle slope, we passed through rather dry Beech-Red Maple stands with a sparse ground flora but with abundant Beech Drops (<i> Epifagus  virginiana</i>), which, at over a foot (0.3 m) in height, were the tallest ever seen by us. Soon following were Black and Yellow Birches and the first Red Spruce, here in the form of saplings, that we had seen since leaving the lowest slopes. A curiosity here was the presence of large umbilicate lichens on a rotting down bole of Beech.<br><dd>
We now entered an area of large blocks of gray, coarse-grained conglomeratic sandstone, such as is usually found in the Kanawha Formation. This sandstone was accompanied by an increase in ferns, among which Intermediate Shield Fern dominated, but with a substantial frequency of Mountain Wood Fern (<i> Dryopteris  campyloptera</i>), a species usually confined to the coolest climates. Only the call of a Wood Pewee (<i>Contopus  virens</i>) broke the silence here.<br><dd>
Ahead the canopy was increasingly populated by young to mature Black and Yellow Birches, with Beech, Red Maple and Northern Red Oak Abundant Red Spruce sapings of various sizes formed a dense understory in places. The only shrub noted was Hobblebush with attractive red and varicolored leaves and red fruit. New York, Itermediate Shield and Mountain WoodFerns comprised a ground cover with a little<i> Medeola</i>. The edible fungus <i>Boletus  subtomentosus</i>, a characteristic species of conifer forests, also occurred here. <br><dd>
As the trail leveled further, there were larger Red Spruce, some 20 inches (0.5 m) dbh or more, in association with good sized Beech, BlackCherry and Red Maple. Striped Maple formed an understory, both saplings and seedlings of Spruce were abundant and Thornless Blackberry and Hobblebush constituted a shrub layer. Ferns continued abundant and were accompanied in the groundflora by Shining Clubmoss, Partridge Berry, Mountain Aster and <i>Brachyelytrum</i>  Grass. In places there were also seedlings and perhaps larger trees of Sugar Maple and Cucumber and Fraser Magnolias, while some down boles had the appearance of American Chestnut. Curtis Goldenrod also occurred here, as at scattered locations at all levels, and was practiclly the only goldenrod seen. In one place a Bear had left its claw marks on a large Spruce, shredding the bark.<br><dd>
The forest types encountered on this traverse illustrate well the relations between the topography, rock type and climate. At the lowest elevations this is reflected in the correlation between the the flora and the microtopography in which the most acidiphile species are concentrated on convexities, a relation similar to that found on our first traverse on 8-5-98 southwest of the Botanical Area parking lot.The widespread occurrence of rich mesic forest types on the mid-slopes of Kennison Mountain is related to rich soils derived from the Bluestone and New River Formations through colluvial processes and to the ample air drainage on these slopesthat prevents the accumulation of cold air. These relations are similar to those observed by us at the Three Forks of the Williams River, where the same geologic formations occur. However there the 1000 foot (300 m) lower elevations allow the occurrence of additional warm climate species such as Tuliptree. Also seen here is the mirror effect by which cold climate species like Spruce, Yellow Birch and Canada Mayflower occur on valley flats and at the highest elevations, but not between.<br><dd>
Our inventory on the morning of 8-26-98 was brief, cursory and extended from F R 102 across and about 1/3 mile (0.5 km) beyond Charles Creek along the Cow Pasture Trail. Conditions were quite warm, with tmperatures in the 80 degree F (25 degree C) range.<br><dd>
The first section of the Trail passes through glade-side forest with a canopy of young to mature Red Spruce, Hemlock, Yellow and Black Birches, Beech, Red and Sugar Maples. Mountain Maple was an understory species here,and in places Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium  flabelliforme</i>) was conspicuous in the ground flora under conifers. However indicators of rich soil, such as Wood Nettle, were also present, while <i>Carex  scabrata</i>  and <i>Scirpus  pollyphyllus</i>  were common in springbrooks.<br><dd>
Birds seen and/or heard in this forest were American Robin (<i>Turdus</i>  <i>migratorius</i>), Blue Jay (<i>Cyanocitta  cristata</i>), Hairy Woodpecker (<i>Picodes</i> <i>villosus</i>), Pileated Woodpecker (<i>Hylotomus  pileatus</i>), Ruffed Grouse (<i>Bonasa  umbellus</i>), Red-eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo  olivaceus</i>), Red-shouldered Hawk (<i>Buteo  lineatus</i>) and a Blue Jay in imitation of the latter. A high point was our dog flushing a Common Snipe (<i>Gallinago  gallinago</i>) from a muddy trail-side ditch. This bird, far south of its normal breeding range, rose a few inches from the dog's nose.<br><dd>
Also seen in this section of the Trail was a large outcrop of light gray limestone, a feature of the underlying Hinton Formation that contributes greatly to the biodiversity of the Glades.<br><dd>
Emerging from the forest, the Trail crosses a large grass/ sedge/ forb meadow with scattered shrubsthat borders Charles Creek. Prominent species here were Grass-leaved and Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrods, Flat- top White and Purple-stem Asters, Common Milkweed (<i>Asclepias syriaca</i>), Pipestem and Silky Willow. Flocks of Goldfinch (<i> Spinus  tristis  tristis</i>) and numerous butterflies, imcluding Swallowtails (<i>Papilio</i>  spp), Monarch (<i>Danaus  plexippus</i>), Red Admiral and other species were seen in this warm, sunny opening. At the first bridge crossing of a creek we noted fish up to 8 inches (20 cm) in length.<br><dd>
After another stream crossing - which marked the main channel of the Creek - we saw more Goldfinch, this time in hawthorn, then small Northern Red Oak with many insect-perforated leaves. followed by Indigo Bunting (<i>Passarina  cyanea</i>), a Wood Nymph (<i>Cercyonis  pegala</i>) Butterfly, and lying in the Trail, a dead Hairy-tailed Mole (<i> Paroscalops  breweri</i>). <br><dd>
As we entered the forest again, we saw Juncos, and in a small gully under a light deciduous canopy, a large patch of Great Indian Plantain (<i>Cacalia  muhlenbergii</i>), with tall seed-bearing stalks. However the Plantain was immediately adjacent to a quite different community of Hemlock with an acidiphile ground flora and which occupied a topographic convexity. Thus ended our traverse.<br><dd>
Of the two traverses made on 9-9-98, the first was a brief morning foray into the swamp forest immediately northeast of the turn-around. The canopy here was young and dominated by Red Spruce, some of which were quite large, in association with Hemlock, Yellow Birch, Red Maple and minor Black Ash. Great Rhododendron was the dominant shrub, but was mostly confined to slightly elevated areas, Spice Bush was common,and it and Winterberry Holly were generally located in wet, lower areas near the springbrooks that imparted the swampy character to this forest. Herbs identified were<i> Carex scabrata</i>, <i>Scirpus  cyperinus</i>, Mad-dog Skullcap, Intermediate Shield and Sensitive Ferns, Dotted St. Johns-wort, <i>Glyceria</i> <i>melicaria</i>, Pennsylvania Bittercress (<i>Cardamine  pensylvanica</i>), Drooping Wood Reed Grass, Clayton's Bedstraw, Downy Wood Violet, Golden Ragwort, Tall Meadowrue, Crooked- stem Aster and Skunk Cabbage. Groundberry was the only vine seen. Mosses noted were <i>Mnium  punctatum</i>  and a species of <i>Atrichum</i>, altough others were doubtless present. The leafy liverwort <i>Bazzania  trilobata</i>  occurred on low hummocks under conifers. The conk <i>Ganoderma  tsugae</i>  was present on dead Hemlock and other fungi included <i>Panellus  seratinus</i>  and <i>P.  stipticus</i>, both also on dead wood, and a <i>Laccaria</i> on soil. An overturned Spruce revealed a soil profile consisting of a three-inch (8 cm) mor layer over a sandy bleached zone. Crayfish castings were common in wet areas.  <br><dd>
During the late morning and afternoon of 9-9-98 we did a rather rapid inventory of the north section of the Cow Pasture Trail.Our inventory began on the west side of a 1/3 mile (0.5 km) - wide peninsula that extendes into the Glades and continued east for a mile along the base of the bordering slope. Species and terrain features are listed here in the order their observation.<br><dd>
The young canopy initially encountered consisted largely of Beech and Black Cherry, with subordinate Yellow Birch, Sugar Maple and Red Spruce. Smooth Serviceberry was observed in the understory and Panicled Aster (<i>Aster  simplex</i>) in the ground cover. Also noted were the fungi <i>Inonotus</i>  <i>tomentosus</i> and Oyster Mushroom as well as a group of Juncos.<br><dd>
We soon came to a beautiful, rather mature forest of the before- mentioned hardwoods, including a 40 inch (1m)dbh Sugar Maple and substantial young Red Spruce. The ground flora included the remains of a large Trillium of undetermined species, Large Round-leaved Orchid and Ramps, with the accompaning fungi Honey Mushroom (<i>Amillaria  mellia</i>), <i>Pholiota  squarrosioides</i>, <i>Trametes  versicolor</i>  and a species of <i>Mycena</i>. It was noted that many small Spruce saplings were retarded in their recent growth of their leaders and had a &quot;squashed- down&quot; appearance as a result. Birds seen here were Chickadee (likely Black-capped) and Blue Jay.<br><dd>
Continuing we saw Miterwort, <i>Carex  plantaginea</i>, Ash Bolete, and on a White Ash, a Striking growth of the moss <i>Neckera  pennata</i>. Then on rather elevated terrain we saw a large American Basswood, Wild Blue Phlox, Sweet-scented Bedstraw and the fungus <i>Campilium  chrysophyllum</i>. At this point Spruce saplings assumed a more normal appearance and there were small saplings of Yellow Buckeye, as well as a small band of thrush, likely Hermit, also the fungus <i>Lactarius  atroviridis</i>, and ,under Hemlock, Painted Trillium. These were followed by Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax  herbacea</i>), Cinnamon Fern, Ground Pine and Bottle Gentian (<i>Gentiana  andrewsii</i>). The soil here, as in many places along this traverse, had a reddish color.<br>

We then came upon an interesting microecotone, where a springbrook was dammed by the trail bank. Vegetation in the resultant wetland consisted largely of <i>Glyceria  melicaria</i>, with sedges and other grasses. Immediately above these on the bank-side there was a layer of Great Indian Plantain with Dotted Thorn, and, above these, on the bank-top, a community of Ground Pine and Groundberry. Since the latter community is acidiphile, and from its position, cosistent with vertical leaching, one might expect a gradient in acidity. Unfortunately, only one pH measurement was secured, that of the dark, fertile-appearing soil at the base of the Plantain, and this yielded a value of 5.0.It is possible that the pH of deeper layers in contact with the Plantain roots has a higher value.<br><dd>
Before emerging into an opening we saw a Winter Wren (<i>Troglodytes</i>  <i>troglodytes</i>) and at the opening edge, vigorous 8 feet (2.4 m) Spruce saplings with growth increments of 2 feet (0.6 m) or more. This opening bordered an inlet of the Glades which consisted largely of Speckled Alder shrub swamp with an edge of Glade St. Johns-wort, Three-way Sedge, grasses and other sedges. Overlooking the inlet was an open stand of wide-spreading Red Spruce and Hemlock, with Mountain Laurel, Tree Clubmoss and <i>Leucobryum  glaucum</i>  in a familiar pattern of verically-leached and acidified upland soils edging less acidic ground water influenced wetland.<br><dd>
Beyond the inlet we arrived at the base of a rather steep northeast- trending slope. This slope was covered by an open stand of young, almost pure Sugar Maple,with trees in the range 0f a foot (0.3 m) dbh. Visible ground cover consisted almost entirely of Ramps, which were manifested as abundant ripe seed stalks. Likely other dormant vernal species were also present. As we continued, we at first passed through a grove of young to mature Yellow Buckeye, then again, still along the base of the slope, past more young Sugar Maple, some Basswood with a ground flora consisting mostly of New York Fern, and a little Blue Cohosh, while at acleaing edge there was Dotted Thorn. The mountain mint <i>Pycnanthemum  verticillatum</i>  was noted in the clearing.<br><dd>
Although our traverse was terminated here, we noted during our return over the same route, another occurrence of Great Indian Plantain, this time under a grove of Yellow Buckeye. Also apparent on the return,was the presencewithin the dominantly red soil type, of patches of a yellow color.<br><dd>
Additional fungi identified from this traverse by R. Hunsucker were the Bear Lentinus  (<i>Lentinellus  ursinus</i>) and the small, rubbery gelatnous, yellow-orange<i> Dacryopinex  spathularia</i>.<br><dd>
As revealed by our inventories, strong correlations exist between the underlying and up-slope rock types, topography and floral diversity and luxuriance Where the nutrient-rich rocks of the Hinton Formation lie at depth, vertical leaching and isolation from ground waterhave given rise to upland connumities of conifers, Mountain Laurel and other acidiphiles. Where access to these rocks is more pronounced and/or ground water reaches the surface in seeps, rich upland forests of Sugar Maple, Basswood, White Ash, Ramps, Great Indian Plantain, Blue Cohosh and other mesic herbs are found. When the wetlands lie between and in isolation from stream channels and are out of contact with ground water, ombrotrophic bogs dominated by <i>Sphagnum</i>  and <i>Polytrichum </i> mosses, cranberries and other acidiphiles develope. Conversely, where wetlands are in contact with streams and ground water, far more diverse floras, dominated by forbs, shrubs, grasses and sedges occur.In some places, as along the Botanical Area boardwalk, there is a close juxtaposition and blending of these habitats.

<b>Cherry River Watershed<br>
Source Walk: 9-8-98<ul><dd>
</b>The Eagles Camp Trailhead on Route 39 is located about five miles (8 km) west of the Cranberry Glades on the flood plain of the Cherry River. The elevation here, from a benchmark, is 3315 feet (1011 m) and the surrounding mountains rise to over 4000 feet asl. Our visit and subsequence inventory were opportunistic in that we spent the night here.<br><dd>
The trailhead was situated in a meadow of asters and goldenrods edged by Beech heavy with nuts. Our inventory was conducted during the evening in light rain. It extended across the River and forested flood plain for about 1/4 mile (0.4 km) along the Trail to a mountain spur on the northeast. The young canopy was dominated by Yellow Birch with subordinate Red Maple, Black Cherry, Canada Hemlock, Beech and Red Spruce. Both Cucumber and Fraser Magnolia seedlings and saplings were seen. Hemlock seedlings and saplings were common and little browsed by Deer. Spruce seedlings and saplings were also common, but those of Sugar Maple  were present only near the upland forest. Understory species noted were Mountain Holly and Mountain Ash. Great Rhododendron was common, particularly along the stream, where Black Elderberry with ripe berries also occurred. Other shrubs were Witch Hazel, a little Wild Hydrangea, Thornless and perhaps other blackberries (<i>Rubus</i>  spp.). No vines were seen.<br><dd>
Ferns noted were New York, Hay-scented, Sensitive, Cinnamon, Intermediate Shield, Rattlesnake and Cut-leaf Grapeferns. Other herbs seen were Filmy Angelica, Drooping Wood Reedgrass, the manna grasses <i>Glyceria</i>  <i>striata</i>  and<i> G.  melicaria</i>, Mountain Oat-grass (mostly along Trail), Autumn Bent Grass, Deertongue Grass, <i>Poa  alsodes</i>, <i>Carex  intumescens</i>, <i>C.  gracillima</i>,  <i>C.  laxiflora</i>, the rush <i>Juncus  effusus</i>, Tall White Lettuce, White Wood Sorrel, Partridge Berry, Mountain Aster, Sweet White Violet, Downy Wood Violet, Turtlehead, Purple-stem Aster in bloom, Northern Bugelweed, Golden Ragwort, Golden Saxifrage (<i>Chrysosplenium  americanum</i>), Crooked-stem Aster, Northern Swamp Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus  septentrionalis</i>), Foam Flower, Hooked Crowfoot, Wood Nettle, White Snakeroot in full bloom, Indian Turnip, Ground Pine, Tree Clubmoss, Shining Clubmoss, the mosses <i>Thuidium</i>  <i>delicatulum</i>, species of <i>Polytrichum</i>, a large <i>Mnium</i> (likely <i>M.  punctatum</i>), <i>Atrichum</i> and patches of <i>Sphagnum</i>. The leafy liverwort <i>Bazzania  trilobata</i> was also present.<br><dd>
Fungi observed on the flood plain were the edible <i>Gyroporus</i>  <i>castaneus</i>, <i>Laccaria  ochropurpurea</i>  (also edible), another <i>Laccaria</i>, the poisonous puffball <i>Scleroderma  citrinum</i>, <i>Rickenella  fibula </i> in moss, <i>Amanita  vaginata</i>, <i>Daedaaleopsis confragosa</i>, <i>Scutellinia  scutellata</i>  and <i>Panellus  stipticus</i>. The last three of these occurred on dead wood, the rest on soil.<br><dd>
The canopy of the upland forest was dominated by mature, but not large, Sugar Maple with Red Maple, Beech, Yellow Birch, Black Cherry and some Spruce and Hemlock. The understory and shrub layers, except for Witch Hazel, seemed to consist largely of small trees such as Beech (likely as sprouts) and Sugar Maple, of which there were also numerous seedlings. Herbs noted wereHairy Sweet Cicely, abundant Ramps, Honewort, a little Christmas Fern, <i>Carex  plantaginea</i>, Indian Tobacco, Smooth Rockcress, Creeping Five-leaf, <i>Carex  scabrata</i>  on a seepy slope, <i>Carex  debilis</i>, Four-leaved Yam, <i>Medeola</i>, Curtis Goldenrod, Beech Drops, New York Fern and, in one place, several plants of the uncommon Fraser's sedge. Most herbs occurred on or immediately below steep slopes, wile areas of low slope were almost devoid of herbs. <br><dd>
Fungi seen in this forest were the edible <i>Tricholomopsis  platyphylla</i>, <i>Trichaptum  biformis</i>, the Hoof Fungus (<i>Fomes  fomentarius</i>), <i>Xerula</i>  <i>furfuracea</i> (Also edible and with a deep root), <i>Ganoderma  applanatum</i>, the red-bleeding <i>Mycena  haematopus</i>, <i>Collybia  dryophylla </i> and unidentified species of <i>Clitocybe</i>  and <i>Entoloma</i>.<b><br><dd>
</b>Among mosses, species of<i> Atrichum</i>  appeared to be prevalent. An uprooted tree exposed tan-colored, clay-rich soil with a thin (3 inch/8 cm) diffuse organic layer. Most Beech appeared healthy, but a few may have been Scale-infected. Some Black Knot (<i>Dibotryon  morbosum</i>) Fungus was present on Black Cherry.<br><dd>
Hinton Formation also underlies the Valley here and the elevation is close to that of the Glades. Additionally, the Valley floor is flat and is constricted down-stream, while sustantial mountain heights loom above. Thus it is not surprising that the flora resembles that of the Glades and vicinity, As at the Glades boreal species on the flood plain benefit from cold air subsidence, while bordering upland slopes host a rich colluvial community that is under the influence of  Hinton Formation nutrients. However, the character of the alluvial flood plain deposits is less clear, since these may be richer in silica and lower in nutrients than some of the upland soils given the character of the Watershed. These conditions and similar floras likely occur over much of the upper watersheds of both the Cranberry and Cherry Rivers. <br><dd>
