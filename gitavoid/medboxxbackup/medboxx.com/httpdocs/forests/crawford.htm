<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>

	The
	landscape northwest of Staunton, Virginia is dominated by Great
	North Mountain and to a lesser degree by Crawford Mountain, both
	forming an offshoot of the Shenandoah Range. Elliott Knob, the
	highest point of Great North Mountain at 4458 feet  (1359 m)  asl,
	towers over Crawford, which rises to little more than 3700 feet (1130 m)  asl. Bedrock consists of Hampshire and Chemung Formations,
	both of Devonian Age. The Hampshire, dominated by sandstone,
	siltstone and interbedded mudstone, and the youngest of the two, is
	probably prevalent in the area of our inventories, while the Chemung
	consists largely of sandstone and shale, but with minor quartz -
	pebble conglomerate and local fossil shell beds  (Rader and Evans,
	1993).  Of particular interest here is the dependence of the
	character of the vegetation on elevation, aspect and general
	topographic position. Relation to bedrock type is unfortunately
	obscure, except in a few places, since little rock is exposed.</DL>

<h2>Ascent
from the Southwest      </h2>
<ul>

	<B>Source
	Walk: 9-11-94,  Warm and Clear</B>
	<p>
	Our
	ascent began at about 2000 feet   (610 meters)  asl from State Route
	688 in the saddle between Crawford and Great North Mountains and was
	toward the Northeast. Consequently the dominant aspect was
	Southwest.
<p>The
	forest at the saddle shows the effect of aspect in that the SW
	facing slope of Crawford Mountain bore  dry ericaceous growth, while
	that on the North Mountain side was notably more mesic. The former
	was dominated by Chestnut Oak  (<I>Quercus  prinus </I>), with
	lesser amounts of  Northern Red, Scarlet, Black and White Oaks (
	<I>Quercus  rubra, Q.  coccinea, Q.</I> <I>velutina </I>and <I>Q. 
	alba</I>),  Black Gum  (<I>Nyssa  sylvatica</I>),  Red Maple  (<I>Acer
	 rubrum</I>),  Black Locust  (<I>Robinia  pseudoacacia</I>),  Pignut
	Hickories  (<I>Carya   glabra</I> and/ or<I> C.  ovalis </I>), Pitch
	and White Pines  (<I>Pinus  rigida</I> and <I>P.  strobus</I>). 
	Sassafras  (<I>Sassafras  albidum</I>),  Downy Serviceberry (
	<I>Amelanchier  arborea</I>)  and Striped Maple  (<I>Acer 
	pensylvanicum</I>)  formed an understory, and the shrub layer
	consisted of Mountain Laurel  (<I>Kalmia  latifolia</I>),  Deerberry
	 (<I>Vaccinium  stamineum</I>)  in fruit, and Upland Low Blueberry (
	<I>Vaccinium  pallidum</I>).  Few herbs except Spotted Wintergreen (
	<I>Chimaphila  maculata</I>)  and a little Teaberry  (<I>Gaultheria 
	procumbens</I>)  penetrate the heavy leaf mat, but bare patches of
	soil along the trail supported a greater variety.
<p>Herbs
	encountered while climbing along the trail in approximate sequence
	below 3200 feet  (976 m)  asl were Silverrod  (<I>Solidago  bicolor</I>
	), Southern Bellflower  (<I>Campanula  divaricata</I>),  Grass -
	leaved Blazingstar  (<I>Liatris  graminifolia</I>),  Bracken Fern (
	<I>Pteridium  aquilinum</I>),  Wild Indigo  (<I>Baptisia  tinctoria</I>
	), Stiff Aster  (<I>Aster  linariifolius</I>),  Common Creeping
	Cinquefoil  (<I>Potentilla  simplex/canadensis</I>),  bush clover (<I>
	Lespedeza  </I>sp),  a vetch,  Birdsfoot Violet  (<I>Viola  pedata</I>
	), introduced Mouse - ear Hawkweed  (<I>Hieracium  pilosella</I>), 
	Dittany  (<I>Cunila  origanoides</I>),  American Pennyroyal (
	<I>Hedeoma  pulegioides </I>), avens (<I> Geum  </I>sp),  Round -
	leaved Tick - trefoil  (<I>Desmodium  rotundifolium </I>), Cliff
	Stonecrop  (<I>Sedum  glaucophyllum</I>),  Nodding Wild Onion (
	<I>Allium  cernuum</I>),  Common Speedwell  (<I>Veronica 
	officinalis</I>)  and a little Hog Peanut  (<I>Amphicarpa  bracteata</I>). 
<p>A
	little above the saddle, at the start of our ascent, we encountered
	a beautiful Copperhead  (<I>Agkistrodon  contortrix</I>),  blending
	in so well among the oak leaves as to be scarcely visible at first.
	Characteristically for this species, it displayed little aggression,
	and after attempting a photograph, we continued our climb. The
	Appalachian naturalist George Constantz   (!994),  in a chapter
	titled &quot; Copperheads' Year,&quot; stresses that though
	poisonous, these snakes pose little threat, but particularly favor
	slopes exposed to the sun, such as this one, on which they gather
	peaceably to go into hibernation in October.
<p>At
	about 3200  (976 m)  feet  elevation  the trail reaches a gently -
	sloping bench and the vegetation, despite the southwest aspect,
	becomes considerably more mesic. Black Locust and Striped Maple
	increase and Black Birch  (<I>Betula  lenta</I>),  White Ash  (
	<I>Fraxinus  americana</I>),  Hophornbeam   (<I>Ostrya   virginiana</I>
	) and hawthorn  (<I>Crataegus </I> sp)  as well as the vines
	Virginia Creeper  (<I>Parthenocissus  quinquefolia</I>)  and Poison
	Ivy  (<I>Rhus  radicans</I>)  make their first appearances. The herb
	layer also is enhanced by Black Cohosh  (<I>Cimicifuga  racemosa</I>
	), Tall Agrimony  (<I>Agrimonia  gryposepala</I>), Thimbleweed (
	<I>Anemone</I>  <I>virginiana </I>),an unidentified <I>Heuchera</I>,
	an Indian plantain  (<I>Cacalia </I> sp),  sedges, Trail Rush (
	<I>Jucus  tenuis</I>),  Bottlebrush Grass (<I> Elymus  hystrix  </I>)
	and even Lamb's Quarters  (<I>Chenopodium  album </I>), a familiar
	of fertile gardens. Accompanying  them is a dogwood, probably
	Panicled  (<I>Cornus  racemosa</I>),  and here much browsed by White
	- tailed Deer  (<I>Odocoileus  virginianus</I> ). 
<p>Upward
	from this bench the first basswood  (<I>Tilia </I> sp),  a few
	Canada Hemlock  (<I>Tsuga  canadensis</I>),  Black Cherry  (<I>Prunus
	 serotina</I>)  and a single Slippery Elm  (<I>Ulmus  rubra</I>) 
	were encountered. The basswood, from its leaves, appeared to be
	White Basswood  (<I>Tilia  heterophylla</I>),  or a form near this
	species. These trees were accompanied by Staghorn Sumac  (<I>Rhus</I>
	 <I>typhina </I>) and a dogwood here definitely identified as
	Panicled from its drupes and other characteristics. In one place
	tall unidentified grasses extended beneath small oaks. However, 
	many trees in the area were up to 30 inches  (0.75 m)  dbh and,
	taking into account growing conditions, perhaps 100 years or more in
	age.
<p>Still
	higher, pignut, Northern Red Oak  (some very large),  Hophornbeam
	and Striped Maple all increased in frequency, mostly at the expense
	of Chestnut Oak. White Snakeroot   (<I>Eupatorium  rugosum</I>) 
	became common and there were some sturdy clumps of Hoary Mountain
	Mint  (<I>Pycnanthemum  incanum</I>).  Chestnut oak appeared to drop
	out between 3400 feet  (1040 m)  and 3500 feet  (1070 m)  asl, but
	large White Oak and a few Black Oak continued to accompany the
	Northern Red Oak.
<p>Near
	the summit, between 3600 feet  (1100 m)  and 3700 feet  (1140 m) 
	asl, Sugar Maple  (<I>Acer  saccharum</I>)  and Butternut  (<I>Juglans
	 cinerea</I>)  put in appearances, and the latter,  although
	elsewhere almost inevitably diseased by Canker Dieback  (<I>Melanconis
	 juglandis</I>),  appeared to be quite healthy at this location, and
	some individuals seemed free of disease. Other common summit species
	were Northern Red Oak, White Ash, pignut, White Basswood, Striped
	Maple and Hophornbeam, while Black Birch was concentrated on
	adjacent, rocky slopes. Hawthorn of unidentified species, as well as
	large shrubs of Witch Hazel  (<I>Hamamelis  virginiana</I>)  were
	common, and there was Panicled as well as Alternate - leaf Dogwood (
	<I>Cornus  alternifolia</I>)  and Choke Cherry  (<I>Prunus 
	virginiana</I>).  The latter is almost confined to high elevations
	or cold valleys in the Central Appalachians, and in the Valley and
	Ridge it usually ornaments isolated peaks.
<p>Further
	evidence of the mesic character and comparatively fertile soil of
	this summit is the presence of Coral Berry  (Symphoricarpos 
	orbiculatus),  a small shrub more characteristic of limestone
	valleys. And, although not rich or diverse, the herb layer include
	such species as Black Cohosh, Four - leaved Yam  (<I>Dioscorea 
	quaternata</I>),  Mountain Meadowrue  (<I>Thalictrum  clavatum</I>
	), Hog Peanut, Clearweed  (<I>Pilea  pumila</I>)  and Hedge
	Buckwheat  (<I>Polygonum  cristatum</I>). 
<p>On
	this day the summit was enlivened by resident Juncos  (<I>Junco 
	hyemalis</I>)  not yet departed to their winter refuge in the
	lowlands, the calls of Ravens (<I> Corvus  corax </I>) and of a Red
	- tailed Hawk  (<I>Buteo  jamaicensis</I>). 
<p>While
	apparent, the effects of elevation and aspect in the 1000 ft.  (300
	m)  vertical climb are subtle, aspect being countered by soil
	improvement at the bench and above, and elevation exerting its
	influence only in the occurrence of a few species such as
	Chokecherry and in the exclusion of Chestnut Oak above 3500 feet. It
	is likely, however, that more detailed studies would show additional
	effects.

<H2>Ascent
From the North Via Chimney Hollow</h2>
 

<ul>
	<b>Source
	Walks 8 - 11 - 91 and 9 - 27 - 95</B><p>
	This
	traverse began at the trailhead on State Route 250 at an elevation
	of about 1950 ft.  (595  meters)  asl, followed the trail along the
	Hollow bottom, ascended past the local prominence of Coal Pit Knob
	and continued on to the summit.  Aspect is easterly initially on the
	climb but westerly most of the way to the top.
<p>Here
	emphasis is on Chimney Hollow, in which, on 9-27-95, the most
	detailed inventory was done.  Pleasant, though partly cloudy, the
	smells of autumn were in the air and birch leaves had begun to fall.
	 The rest of the traverse, from the Hollow to the summit, which was
	done on 8-11-91, resulted in a much less detailed inventory.
<p>The
	stream that occupies the Hollow is probably seasonally dry or
	restricted to subsurface flow, but on 9-27-95 had considerable
	water, perhaps due to recent rains.  Except for water striders and
	some unidentified insects, little stream life was in evidence. 
	However no specific surveys for such life were possible in the time
	available.
<p>For
	most of the Hollow&rsquo;s length &mdash; about a mile (1.6
	kilometers) in all &mdash; the forest canopy is dominated by large
	White Oak with even larger White Pine, some greater than 39 inches
	(1 meter) dbh, and northern Red Oaks, also large. Canada Hemlock,
	apparently free of the Hemlock Wooly Adelgid   was concentrated in
	the lower Hollow, and formed dense groves near the highway.  Neither
	this nor the common Red Maple attained the size of the oaks and
	pines.  Other less important canopy species include Black Locust,
	pignut hickory and some beautiful large Shagbark Hickory   (<I>Carya
	 ovata</I>),  as well as Black Birch and Tuliptree  (<I>Liriodendron
	 tulipifera</I>),  with the last two increasing in abundance toward
	the upper Hollow.  Perhaps indicative of limits to the extent of
	rich soil is the near absence of Sugar Maple except for scattered
	saplings and seedlings.  As usual in such hollows, there are a few
	Cucumber Magnolia  (<I>Magnolia  acuminata</I>).   However, only one
	basswood was seen, and it had characteristics of both American and
	White variants.  White Ash also occurred, but is most conspicuous as
	seedlings in the upper Hollow.
<p>Prominent
	in the understory in moist areas is Musclewood (<I> Carpinus
	caroliniana</I>),  a species ordinarily as demanding of soil as
	Sugar Maple but requiring more moisture than the Maple.  Its
	occurrence may have depended on utilization of smaller patches of
	rich soil than those which are required by the Maple.  Other
	understory trees  were Flowering Dogwood  (<I>Cornus  florida</I>), 
	Sassafras (mostly seedlings) and Serviceberry of undetermined
	species.
<p>Striped
	Maple, which is usually not present much below 2000 ft. (600 meters)
	at this latitude, occurs as seedlings in the lower part of the
	Hollow and seems to increase in amount toward the upper end, as
	might be expected.
<p>The
	shrub layer throughout is dominated by Mountain Laurel, Witch 
	Hazel, and in the upper Hollow by Minnie-bush  (<I>Menziesia pilosa
	</I>).  In some places, as particularly along the trail, American
	Hazelnut (<I>Corylus americana</I>), distinguished by its hairy
	-glandular twigs from its more northern congener, Beaked Hazelnut (
	<I>Corylus  cornuta</I>),  formed dense thickets.  Other shrubs
	included Maple-leaf Viburnum (<I>Viburnum   acerifolium</I>),
	Deerberry, Upland Low Blueberry and Carolina Rose (<I>Rosa
	carolina</I>), a native with conspicuous solitary red fruits.  A
	single bush of Great Rhododendron  (<I>Rhododendron maximum </I>)
	had a lonely outpost near a seep, but more of this species may occur
	elsewhere  (as we shall see).   Blackberry canes occurred in open
	areas and in one place what appeared to be <I>Rubus canadensis</I>,
	the Thornless Blackberry, was noted, although this species is
	usually more at home at higher elevations.
<p>While
	high-climbing vines were scarce, Virginia Creeper and to a lesser
	degree, Poison Ivy were widespread, at least as ground cover.  Only
	one grape vine, a small Summer Grape (<I>Vitis  &aelig;stivalis</I> ), was seen. However, Common Greenbrier (<I>Smilax rotundifolia</I>)
	vines were quite common.
<p>Ground
	cover in acid soil areas was dominated by Partridge Berry (<I>
	Mitchella repens</I>)  and Teaberry and, in less acid areas, by Hog
	Peanut. Partridge Berry formed large patches where moisture and
	shade were ample, while Teaberry was concentrated in dry areas with
	small amounts of Trailing Arbutus (<I>Epigea repens</I>), Spotted
	Wintergreen and scattered Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<I>Goodyera
	pubescens</I>).  In one place, along the trail about a quarter mile
	(0.4 km) from the highway, there was a small patch of acid-loving
	herbs including the less common Round - leaf Pyrola  (<I>Pyrola
	rotundifolia</I>).  Here this plant was closely inter - grown with
	Partridge Berry, Teaberry, Trailing Arbutus, mosses and <I>Cladonia</I>,
	lichen, all under Mountain Laurel, Hemlock and White Pine. It was
	also seen scattered throughout in other areas.
<p>Another
	acid soil lover is Roundlobe Hepatica (<I>Hepatica americana</I>)
	which, as here, is generally common but seldom abundant.  Much more
	abundant, and in places forming large patches, is acid-tolerant but
	not acid-dependent Creeping Five-leaf which comes in two difficult
	to distinguish species:  <I>Potentilla canadensis</I>  and <I>P.
	simplex</I>.  Both Five-leaf and another creeper, Common Speedwell
	(<I>Veronica  officinalis</I>), become more abundant in the upper
	Hollow.  While these species are prone to dry or slightly moist
	areas, Cleerweed is, in acid environments such as this, confined to
	quite moist habitats, as distinguished from more alkaline
	conditions, which enable it to endure dryer habitats.
<p>Other
	generally widespread herbs encountered were Sweet-scented Bedstraw
	(<I>Galium triflorum</I>), White Wood Aster  (<I>Aster divaricatus
	</I>), Calico Aster (<I> A. lateriflorus </I>) (very abundant along
	the trail), Wild Geranium (<I> Geranium maculatum</I>),  Four-leaved
	Yam, a little Indian Tobacco (<I>Lobelia inflata</I>), Mountain
	Bellwort  (<I>Uvularia pudica </I>)and Plume Lily (<I>Smilacina
	racemosa</I>).  Indian Cucumber-root (<I>Medeola virginiana</I>),
	distinguished by its whorl of monocot leaves and white swollen
	rootstocks, is at home in a special niche of cool and moist
	microhabitats that occur in restricted parts of the Hollow.
<p>Of
	particular interest is Wild Sarsaparilla (<I>Aralia nudicaulis</I>),
	which, as indicated elsewhere, is somewhat sensitive to elevation
	and prefers cool habitats.  This plant was not observed in the lower
	Hollow, but appears in small amounts about a half mile (0.8 km) from
	the highway and becomes quite abundant on the east-facing slope
	where the trail leaves the Hollow at about 2200 ft. (670 meters)
	asl.
<p>Grasses
	and sedges flourish along the trail and in moist areas.  Although
	most of the trail grass remains unidentified, some Mountain Oat
	Grass (<I>Danthonia compressa</I>) occurs.  White Grass (<I>Leersia
	virginica</I>) is common in moist areas, while the forest grass
	<I>Brachyelytrum erectum</I>, its identity confirmable by its knotty
	rootstock, occurs in dryer areas.  Other identifiable grasses are
	Autumn Bent (<I>Agrostis perennans</I>) and mama grass (<I>Glyceria
	sp.</I>), the latter generally confined to seeps.  Sedges also occur
	in seepy areas and along the stream, but are difficult to identify
	so late in the season.  <I>Carex scabrata</I>, which still bore its
	characteristic seeds, is an exception and<I> Scirpus pollyphyllus, 
	</I>with characteristic vegetative propagules, was present as well.
<p>The
	most abundant ferns were Christmas (<I> Polystichum  acrostichoides
	</I>), New York  (<I>Thelypteris   noveboracensis </I>) and Cinnamon
	(<I> Osmunda cinnamomea </I>), perhaps in that order, while
	Intermediate  Shield Fern (<I> Dryopteris   intermedia </I>)and
	Sensitive Fern (<I>Onoclea  sensibilis</I>) occured in a few places.
	Ground Pine  (<I>Lycopodium flabelliforme </I>), in the lower
	Hollow, and Tree Clubmoss  (<I>L. obscurum </I>) farther up, occur
	with such plants as Partridge Berry, Gay Wings (<I>Polgyala
	paucifolia</I>) and Wood Betony (<I>Pedicularis canadensis</I>). 
	Mosses, in particular, haircap (<I>Polytrichum</I> sp), but also
	Fern (<I>Thuidium</I> sp.) and others show lush growth and are
	almost omnipresent in acid soil areas.  There they frequently are
	accompanied in beautiful harmony by <I>Cladonia</I> lichens as well.
	 In addition the &ldquo;Beard&rdquo; Lichen (<I>Usnea</I>  sp.)
	graces tree trunks, and in particular those of large old White
	Pines, concentrating on the north side of the trunk.
<p>Scattered
	along the Hollow, mostly in the vicinity of the stream, but also
	elsewhere, are a number of small wetlands, seeps etc.  The flora
	associated with these is generally dominated by sedges and grasses
	but also includes broad-leaf herbs such as Northern Bugleweed
	(<I>Lycopus uniflorus</I>), Turtlehead (<I>Chelone glabra</I>) and
	Crooked-stem Aster (<I>Aster prenanthoides</I>).  A seep a half mile
	(0.8 km) from the highway, contained, in addition to these, Golden
	Ragwort (<I> Senecio  aureus</I>  ),  Hog Peanut, Sensitive Fern,
	Bedstraw (<I>Galium</I> sp.), White Grass, a sanicle (<I>Sanicula</I>
	 sp.), Clearweed and Musclewood, with a clump of Great Rhododendron
	off to the side.  Farther up the Hollow a streamside wetland
	contained sedges, including <I>Carex scarbrata</I>, Fowl Managrass
	(<I>Glyceria stirata</I>), Arrow-leaf Tear Thumb (<I>Polygonum
	sagittatum</I>), Crooked-stem Aster, Clearweed, Golden Ragwort and
	Autumn Bent Grass.  Nearby Intermediate Shield Fern grew on a down
	tree.
<p>As
	already implied, there is a subtle change in forest composition from
	the lower to the upper Hollow.  A spot survey where the power line
	crosses shows White Oak still dominant in the canopy with White
	Pine, Northern Red Oak and rather small Red Maple and Black Birch
	all common.  Understory and shrubs include Striped Maple,
	Witchhazel, Mountain Laurel, considerable <I>Menziesia pilosa</I> 
	and Hazelnut with small amounts of <I>Rosa carolina</I>.
<p>A little
	farther on there is evidence of a powerful lightening stroke that
	killed three large White Pines and a large White Oak and left one of
	the Pines shattered into jagged fragments.  These trees stand
	closely spaced on a small bench fifteen feet (4 meters) above the
	trail.
<p>Somewhat
	before the trail begins to climb, where White Ash seedlings become
	common, there is an occurrence of Squaw Weed (<I>Senecio obovatus</I>),
	a plant generally dependent on rich soil, in its winter leaf rosette
	form.  Then, where the trail begins its climb, in somewhat dryer
	soil, appeared the first tall racemes of Featherbells, (<I>Stenanthium
	gramineum</I>), a lily-family native that becomes more abundant at
	higher elevations.  Also Chestnut Oak now becomes an important
	component of the canopy and there are scattered Curtis&rsquo;
	Goldenrod (<I>Solidago curtisii</I>) along the trail, which passes
	through increasingly ericaceous forest.  And here, as if to bid
	farewell for the Hollow, stand several large Cucumber Magnolias as
	land marks to every hiker.
<p>The
	ascent toward Coalpit Knob has a westerly aspect for the most part
	whereas above it, it is more southwesterly.  For the most part the
	forest on these slopes is dry and ericaceous, with the canopy
	dominated by Chestnut Oak and with many of the same herbs as that of
	the southwest side of the mountain. However, near the top, the slope
	steepens and the forest becomes more mesic with, as on the SW side,
	Chestnut Oak replaced by Northern Red Oak as well as basswood and
	other mesic species.  Here Mountain Holly (<I>Ilex montana</I>) and
	the herb Wild Liveforever (<I>Sedum telephioides</I>), a tall
	stonecrop, were encountered.  Although the summit plant species were
	recorded for the SW ascent, an addition, Mountain Maple  (<I>Acer
	spicatum </I>),was found on this ascent.
<p>Unfortunately,
	circumstances on the 1991 ascent did not permit a detailed record of
	species or their elevational limits being made.  It is possible that
	a greater diversity of species may occur on the steep upper slope of
	the ascent than on the gentler SW slopes.
<p>Because
	of the slope configuration above Chimney Hollow and the narrow width
	of the upper Hollow, cold air drainage into it is not particularly
	favored.  This may be reflected in the apparent paucity of markedly
	northern species among the Hollow&rsquo;s shrubs and herbs  (but see
	later).

<p>The
	primary purpose of this visit was to collect soil samples for pH
	determination, but also for a brief survey of mosses. The following
	samples were collected along a traverse extending perhaps  1/4 mile
	 (0.4 km)  from the highway. Exposed rock appeared to be thin bedded
	 (10 inch / 25 cm maximum thickness)  siltstone with interbedded
	shale. Siltstone flags were abundant in the stream.
	<p>
	#1 moist
	surface at border of mor and layer beneath, next to Teaberry and
	Potentilla simplex/canadensis. This appeared to be a silt loam. The
	pH was 4.4 both initially and 24 hours later.
	<p>
	#2 a moss
	specimen from the base of a six inch dbh White Oak. This was
	identified in part under the microscope as a species of <I>Fissidens
	</I> (see later). 
	
	<p>
	#3
	soil, apparently silt loam, next to Teaberry and Trailing Arbutus.
	The pH was 4.5 both initially and 24 hours later.
	<p>
	#4  soil,
	silt loam, under a patch of <I>Cladina </I> (now <I>Cladonia </I>again<I>
	</I>!),  with nearby Teaberry and Partridge Berry. The pH was 4.5
	both initially and 24 hours later.
	<p>
	#5 soil,
	silt loam, next to Round - leaf Pyrola and Round - leaf Hepatica
	with varicolored leaves. The pH was 4.5 both initially and 24 hours
	later.
	<p>
	#6 soil,
	very dark and rich in organic matter, under Great Rhododendron. The
	pH was 4.5 both initially and after 24 hours.
	<p>
	#7 soil
	or possibly subsoil, greenish yellow clay, from eroded vertical
	stream bank. the pH was 5.0 or higher, with an uncertain reading.
	<p>
	#8 soil,
	organic silt loam, under Partridge Berry. The pH was 4.5.
	<p>
	#9 soil,
	silt loam, under Mountain Laurel. The pH was 4.5.
	<BR>
<p>The
	entire forest floor of the part of the Hollow traversed appeared to
	be dominated by Teaberry, with abundant Partridge Berry in moister
	areas. Trailing Arbutus and Pyrola were less common. The most
	prevalent mosses appeared to be species of <I>Thuidium</I> and
	<I>Dicranum</I>, with a little of the previously mentioned <I>Fissidens</I>
	at tree bases. 
<p>As
	indicated above, pH seemed to be quite uniform in surface layers,
	perhaps established by reaction of rain water with leaf mor and the
	underlying silt loam. Few birds but Pileated Woodpeckers <I>(
	Dryocopus  pileatus</I>)  were seen or heard.

	Our
	inventory began at ~ 10:30 AM in the dominantly Hemlock grove near
	the road and extended perhaps 1/3 mile  (~ 0.8 km)  up - valley to a
	little past the first large White Pines that border the trail. It
	should be mentioned that this inventory occurred in a pause of a
	prolonged, unprecedented rainy period, The inventory also included
	making a bryophyte collection for later identification by R.
	Hunsucker, who, as usual, was also a major participant in the
	inventory as a whole. The numbered bryophyte associations and
	described habitats are presented in rough concert with the vascular
	floras as they are encountered. Liverworts are indicated by the
	symbol (Li) and mosses constitute the rest.
<p>While
	mature but not large Hemlock is the most abundant canopy species in
	this grove, much the largest and most imposing trees are White Oak.
	Although the grove is severely afflicted by the Adelgid and the
	crowns much thinned, the Hemlock forest character persists, and
	there is a generally sparse shrub and ground flora. It should also
	be mentioned that Hemlock, although scarcely greater in size than
	saplings, forms a major component for a considerable distance up the
	Hollow. Thus we have:
 <p>
	#1
	bryophytes from the lower trunk of White Oak:
	    <ul>
	<I>Anomodon  minor, Anomodon  rostratus, Entodon  brevisetus,
	Entodon  compressus, Fissidens   subbasilaris,</I> <I>Frullania 
	riparia</I> (Li), <I>Forsstroemia  trichomitria, Haplohymenium 
	triste, Leucodon    julaceus, Mnium</I>  <I>cuspidatum, Polytrichum 
	ohioense</I>  (on soil over roots),  <I>Pylaisiella  selwynii</I>
	<BR>
<p>Understory
	and shrub species here consisted of Downy Serviceberry, Witch Hazel,
	the pignut  <I>Carya  glabra,</I> including seedlings, a few Sugar
	and Red Maple saplings and seedlings. Common Greenbrier was the only
	vine seen. Herbs, largely around tree bases, included Common Many
	Knees  (<I>Polygonatum  biflorum</I>),  Round - leaf  Pyrola,  Four
	- leaved Yam, May Apple, the Enchanter's Nightshade <I>Circaea 
	quadrisulcata,</I> blooming Rue Anemone  (<I>Anemonella </I>
	<I>thalictroides</I>),  Downy Wood Violet  (<I>Viola  sororia</I>), 
	Palmate - leaf Violet  (<I>V.  palmata</I>),  <I>Caex  digitalis,</I>
	<I>Carex  laxiflora, Poa  autumnalis</I> and the wood rush <I>Luzula
	 acuminata. </I>This date for blooming Rue Anemone is considerably
	later than for this species in the Shenandoah Valley.
<p>At this
	point a soil temperature determination  (T - 665)  was made on a
	flat aspect in the Hemlock grove. The result was T = 14.0 deg C, or
	essentially the same as that obtained at Ramsey's Draft on the
	previous day. Then continuing our collecting, we obtained:
</ul><p>
	#2
	bryophyte from the base and trunk of Hemlock:
	<ul>
<p><I>Brotherella
	tenuirostris, Chiloscyphus  profundus</I> (Li). <I>Dicranum 
	montanum, Frullania  asagrayana</I> (Li), <I>Hypnum  curvifolium,
	Plagiothecium  laetum, Pylaisiella</I>  sp, <I>Tetraphis  pellucida,</I>
	<I>Thuidium  delicatulum</I> (on soil over roots)  
</ul><p>
	#3
	bryophytes from soil
	<ul>
<p><I>Atrichum
	 angustatum, Dicranella</I>  sp  (vegetative),  <I>Hypnum 
	curvifolium, Leucobryum  glaucum,</I> <I>Plagiothecium  laetum,
	Rhynchostegium  serrulatum, Thuidium  delicatulum</I>
</ul><p>
	#4
	submerged bryophyte sample from stream
	<ul>
<p><I>Amblystegium
	 fluviatile</I>
	<BR>
<p>Continuing
	up - Hollow, we noted <I>Carex  purpurifera</I>, abundant White Oak
	seedlings, Black Cherry, Maple - leaf Viburnum, some in bloom, Great
	Chickweed in summer leaf, abundant Partridge Berry, White Wood
	Aster, Gaywings  (<I>Polygala  paucifolia</I>),  a much stunted
	jewelweed  (<I>Impatiens </I> sp),  Crooked - stem Aster, Fowl
	Mannagrass  (<I>Glyceria  striata</I>)  and the alien form of Self -
	heal  (<I>Prunella  vulgaris</I>).  Next collected were:
</ul><p>
	#5
	bryophytes from rocks in stream:
	<ul>
<p><I>Brachythecium
	 acuminatum, Brachythecium  </I>sp<I>, Brotherella  recurvans,
	Entodon  compressus, Fissidens  taxifolius, Homomallium  adnatum,
	Leucobryum  albidum, Mnium  cuspidatum, Platygyrium  repens,
	Pylaisiella  polyantha, Rhynchostegium  serrulatum </I>
	<BR>
<p>Observed
	here was Big - leaf Aster  (<I>Aster  macrophyllus</I>).  Then
</ul><p>
	#6
	bryophytes from soil and soil over tree roots along stream
	<ul>
<p><I>Amblystegium
	 varium, Anomodon  rostratus, Brachythecium  oxacladon,
	Brachythecium  sp, Brotherella  tenuirostris, Dicranella 
	heteromalla, Entodon  compressus, Eurhynchium  hians, Physcomitrium 
	pyriforme, Pylaisiella  selwynii</I>
	<BR>
<p>We
	now approached the trail, with its more open environment, noting
	Teaberry and a large  (&gt; 25 m squared)  patch of  Early Low
	Blueberry  (<I>Vaccinium  angustifolium</I>),  a species usually
	limited to elevations above 3000 feet  (915 m)  asl. Here, at
	virtually the lowest point of the Hollow,. its presence seemed to
	argue for substantial cold air subsidence and accumulation, which is
	 in agreement with the measured soil temperature. Also noted  was
	the Creeping Five - leaf  <I>Potentilla  simplex</I>, here in bloom,
	and thus aiding identification. Fauna heard and/or seen at this
	point were the birds Scarlet Tanager  (<I>Piranga  olivacea </I>),
	Ovenbird  (<I>Seiurus  aurocapillus</I>),  Red - eyed Vireo  (<I>Vireo
	 olivaceus </I>)and Yellow - billed Cuckoo  (<I>Coccyzus  americanus</I>), as well as a pure white, likely nocturnal moth, &quot;concealing&quot;
	itself ineffectively under a small herb leaf. It should be mentioned
	however, that the numerous small, light colored lepidoptera that
	characterize rich mesic forests at this time of year, were not
	observed in this forest.
<p>We now
	moved up - Hollow along the trail, making incursions into the
	adjacent forest. Among the most conspicuous herbs was blooming
	Yellow Stargrass  (<I>Hypoxis  hirsuta</I>).  Associated species
	were Mountain Laurel, the wood rush <I>Luzula  multiflora</I>, the
	conspicuous moss<I> Pleurozium  schreberi</I>  (which, curiously,
	does not appear in any of our collected bryophyte samples!) and an
	attractive &quot;<I>Cladina</I>&quot; lichen. Here also an
	unidentified Chickadee  (<I>Parus </I> sp)  was heard.
<p>We now
	came upon a bush that bore a superficial resemblance to Minnie -
	bush, but which, on the basis of vegetative characteristics, proved
	to be Mountain Azalea  (<I>Rhododendron  roseum</I>).  Next seen
	were Deerberry, Scarlet Oak, and abundant luxuriant <I>Dicranum 
	scoparium</I> moss. At this point an Acadian Flycatcher  (<I>Epidonax
	 virescens</I>)  was both seen and heard. Then, encountering a seep
	along the trail, we saw a bulrush, likely <I>Scirpus  pollyphyllus</I>,
	Northern Bugleweed. and Lance - leaved Loosestrife  (<I>Lysimachia 
	lanceolata</I>).  These were followed by Upland Low Blueberry,
	Bluets  (<I>Houstonia  caerulea</I>)  and the fungi <I>Xerula</I> 
	<I>purpurea</I>, <I>Amanita  pantherina</I>  var  <I>velutipes</I>,
	<I>A,  ravenellii, Astraeus  hygrometricus,</I> <I>Clavicorona 
	pyxidata</I>  (on rotting wood)  and an unidentified <I>Russula.</I>
	Here we again noted the common occurrence of the forest bluegrass
	<I>Poa  autumnalis</I>, which here appears to substitute for the
	similar but colder climate species <I>P. alsodes</I>, which is
	common in West Virginia's Alleghenies.
<p>Meanwhile
	the following bryophytes were collected:
</ul><p>
	#7
	
	from various moist habitats
	<ul>
<p><I>Brothella
	 recurvans</I>  (moist base of tree near stream),  <I>Fontinalis 
	noavae - angliae</I>  (from stream),  <I>Mnium  hornum</I>  (edge of
	stream, bank etc.),  <I>Mnium  punctatum</I>  (wet humus near stream
	),<I>Platylomella  lescurii</I>  (on wet rock). 
</ul><p>
	#8
	from bases and roots of Hemlock and hardwoods
	<ul>
<p><I>Anomodon

	<ul>
<p><I>Chiloscyphus

	Nowellina</I>  <I>curvifoia</I> (Li)  (on debarked conifers), 
	<I>Platygyrium  repens, Pylaisiella</I>  sp  (vegetative) 
	<p>
<p>Here
	we again heard an Ovenbird, noted a pussytoes, likely <I>Antennaria 
	plantaginifolia</I>, as well as abundant Rattlesnake Weed. (
	<I>Hieracium  venosum</I>).  
	
	<p>
	Meanwhile the following bryophyte
	samples were collected:
	</ul>
<p>
	#11 from
	non - submerged rocks in stream:
	<ul>
<p><I>Brachythecium
	 oxacladon, Campylium  chrysophyllum, Mnium  punctatum, Platylomella
	 lescurii</I>
</ul><p>
	#12
	
	from wet rocks in and along stream
	<ul>
<p><I>Hygrohypnum
	 eugyrium</I>  (submerged and on wet rocks),  <I>Platylomella 
	lescurii</I>
	<BR>
<p>Continuing
	up - Hollow, we encountered Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, abundant,
	very luxuriant, Delicate Fern Moss  (<I>Thuidium  delicatulum</I>) 
	and cushions of <I>Leucobryum</I> moss, Downy Serviceberry and
	abundant blooming Yellow Stargrass; then heard the call of another
	Ovenbird. Next seen were the fungus <I>Collybia  dryophylla,</I>
	Sweet - scented Bedstraw, Interrupted Fern, seedlings of Striped
	Maple, Spotted Wintergreen and Christmas Fern. We then flushed a
	small fledgeling from the forest floor, likely an Ovenbird, that
	kept close to the ground, and were cheered that at least some birds
	had nesting success in the face of all the cold rain during the past
	weeks.
<p>We now
	reached several large White Pine that stood immediately adjacent to
	the trail, and in the vicinity tallied the following fungi: <I>Galiella
	 rufa,</I> the moss - dweller <I>Rickenella  fibula, Ustulina 
	deusta</I> and <I>Pluteus  cervinus. </I>These were followed by
	Slender Wedge Grass  (<I>Sphenopholis  intermedia</I>),  <I>Carex 
	styloflexa</I>  (a dominantly coastal plain species),  <I>Carex 
	platyphylla,</I> Red Hickory  (<I>Carya  ovalis</I>),  the fungus
	<I>Tricholomopsis  platyphylla</I>  (&quot;Platterfull&quot;),  then
	<I>Carex  gracillima</I> and <I>Carex  baileyi.</I> Now, on the
	northwest side of the Hollow. we encountered Tuliptree, Allegheny
	Crowfoot  (<I>Ranunculus  allegheniensis</I>),  <I>Laccaria  laccata</I>
	 (a fungus characteristic of oligotropic moist and acidic
	environments)  and on the steep valley - side, White Clintonia (
	<I>Clintonia  umbellulata</I>).  and Bunchflower  (<I>Veratrum 
	parviflorum</I>).  Also, on a rock outcrop on the same valley - 
	side, we found Maidenhair Spleenwort  (<I>Asplenium </I> <I>trichomanes</I>), a species somewhat characteristic of carbonate substrates, but,
	in the absence of acid for testing, unconfirmed as such by us in
	this case. Moving again to the central Hollow, we saw Bushy Panic
	Grass  (<I>Panicum  dichtomum</I>)  and Variable Panic Grass (
	<I>Panicum  commutatum</I>) ; then resumed our bryophyte collecting
	with the following:
</ul><p>
	#13
	from standing hardwood and rotting down wood:
	<ul>
	<I>	Amblystegium
	 varium, Anomodon  attenuatus, Anomodon  rostratus, Brachythecium 
	oxycladum, Bryhinia  graminicolor, Campylium  chrysophyllum,
	Dicranum  fuscesens, Dicranum  scoparium, Eurhynchium  hians,
	Fissidens  subbasilaris, Forsstroemia  trichomitria, Frullania 
	asagrayana </I>(Li), <I>Hypnum  pallescens, Mnium  affine  var 
	ciliare, Platygyrium  repens, Pylaisiella  </I>sp<I>, Rhodobryum 
	roseum, Rhynchostegium  serrulatum, Thelia  hertella, Thuidium 
	delicatulum, Ulota  crispa</I>
</ul><p>
	#14
	from conifer trunks:
	<ul>
<p><I>Dicranum
	 montanum, Hypnum  curvifolium, Hypnum  pallescens</I>
	
	
</ul><p>
	#15
	from dead wood and bark on the ground
	<ul>
<p><I>Chiloscyphus
	 profundus </I>(Li),<I> Dicranum  flagellare, Dicranum  sp, Hypnum 
	curvifolium, Mnium  affine, Nowellia  curvifolia </I>(Li)<I> </I>(
	on debarked conifer<I>),  Rhynchostegium  serrulatum, Thuidium 
	delicatulum</I>
</ul><p>
	#16 from
	sandstone rock, moist to wet small cliff:
	<ul>
<p><I>Aulocomnium
	 heterostichum, Bartramia  pomiformis, Blepharostoma  trichophyllum
	</I>(Li),<I> Chiloscyphus  profundus </I>(Li), <I>Eurhynchium 
	hians, Mnium  cuspidatum, Odontoschisma  denudatum </I>(Li),<I>
	Plagiothecium  cavifolium, Radula  abconica </I>(Li), <I>Thuidium 
	delicatulum</I>
	<p>
	These
	were followed by Purple Bedstraw  (<I>Galium  latifolium</I>), 
	blooming Green and Gold  (<I>Chrysogonum  virginianum</I>),  common
	Northern Red Oak seedlings and again, frequent <I>Poa  autumnals. </I>
<p>At
	this point a second soil temperature  (T - 666)  was taken, also on
	an essentially flat aspect. The result was T= 14.5 deg C, a value
	not significantly different from that obtained ~1/3 mile down -
	Hollow. 
	
<p>Moving
	again toward the northwest side of the Hollow, we saw more Tree
	Clubmoss, American Hazelnut and Indian Turnip  (<I>Arisaema 
	triphyllum</I>).  Then arriving at a springbrook at the base of the
	mountain slope, we noted a quite diverse flora consisting of
	Maidenhair Fern  (<I>Adiantum  pedatum</I>),  Mealy Bellwort (
	<I>Uvularia  perfoliata</I>),  abundant New York Fern  (<I>Thelypteris
	 noveboracensis</I>),  Hooked Crowfoot  (<I>Ranunculus  recurvatus</I>), seedlings of White Ash, the sedge <I>Carex  prasina</I>, American
	Water - pennywort  (Hydr<I>ocotyle  americana </I>), Indian Cucumber
	- root, Intermediate Shield Fern, Golden Ragwort, Christmas Fern
	and, adjacent to these, large vigorous Great Rhododendron. 
<p>Before
	terminating our traverse and returning to our point of origin we
	noted the following: Wild Sarsaparilla, Teaberry, more Tree
	Clubmoss, Common Greenbrier, Carolina Rose, Honewort   (<I>Cryptotaenia
	 canadensis</I>).  Devil's Bit  (<I>Chamaelirium  luteum</I>), 
	trailing Arbutus,  American Chestnut  (<I>Castanea  dentata</I>) 
	sprouts, Hairy Angelica  (<I>Angelica  venenosa</I>)  and
	Featherbells.
<p>To serve
	as a basis of comparison with other forest types it is useful to
	determine the frequency of occurrence of the 68 bryophyte taxa in
	the 16  (17 if <I>Pleurozium  schreberi</I> is included)  habitat
	groups.
	They are
	as follows:
	
	<p>
	<br>7
	<I>Thuidium  delicatulum</I>
	<br>4
	<I>Campylium  chrysophyllum</I>

<h2>Summary</h2>
 <ul>

	The
	vascular flora of Chimney Hollow as a whole, and particularly that
	of its lower part, reflects the markedly acidic conditions of soils
	derived from the Devonian sandstones, siltstones and shales, as
	revealed in outcrops and in the stream bedload. This fundamental
	acidity was in all probability also enhanced by the environment
	created by Hemlock and by rainwater leaching. It shares these
	habitat characteristics with other Hemlock dominated forests such as
	that of West Virginia's Cathedral State Park  (see <a href=cathedral.htm>our section on
	the latter</a>),  as well as others such as that discussed below. <p>
	
	Of
	some interest also is the occurrence of Early Low Blueberry, as well
	as soil temperatures in the lower Hollow similar to those at
	Ramsey's Draft. Although the elevation here is lower and the
	configuration of the Hollow less suited to cold air accumulation
	than at Ramsey's Draft  (Mueller, 2002, 2003),  the Hollow opens to
	the northwest  while Ramsey's draft opens to the southwest.
	Additionally, the soils in the Hollow appear less stony than those
	of the Draft, a feature that favors moisture retention and cooler
	soil temperatures  (Davidson <I>et al</I>, 1998). 
	<p>
	Among the
	mosses, it should be noted that, except for <I>Thuidium 
	delicatulum</I>, the relatively numerous species  (for  Central
	Appalachian forests)  recorded here are not widely distributed among
	the habitat groups. This characteristic is in fact more marked here
	than in any other forest type inventoried by us thus far. Perhaps
	reflecting the generally acid substrate and the numerical dominance
	of Hemlock in much of the area surveyed, three species, <I>Tetraphis
	 pellucida., Brotherella  recurvans</I> and <I>Nowellia  curvifolia</I>,
	which are among the most widely distributed species in the virgin
	Hemlock forest at Cathedral State Park, are also conspicuous here,
	if not as well distributed.  
<p>To
	place the moss flora in a greater perspective, it may be compared
	with a much larger one from Bad Branch on Kentucky's Pine Mountain (
	Risk, 1998).  The general environment of that area and its vascular
	flora were considered in some detail by Braun  (1935 and 1950). The
	Bad Branch watershed consists of a complex of deeply incised
	headwater streams, slanting spray - bathed rock faces, cliffs,
	grottoes, waterfalls and other structures that add up to 
	bewildering habitat diversity, and at least 149 moss species and 54
	hepatic taxa  (Davison and Risk, 1992).  Like much of Chimney Hollow
	and Cathedral State Park, acid, siliceous bedrock, in this case
	sandstone, is prevalent at Bad Branch, and the mesic ravine forests
	in proximity to the stream are dominated by Canada Hemlock. Also,
	boreal species, such as Yellow Birch  (<I>Betula  allegheniensis</I>), are present as a consequence of the temperature lowering effect
	of the abundant moisture (Davidson <I>et al</I>, 1998).  This effect
	is particularly marked for the moss flora, which contains a number
	of disjunct northerners. The Chimney Hollow moss flora, as
	inventoried by us, shares 38 species with Bad Branch and those most
	characteristic of Cathedral Park are included. Quite generally, the
	substrates on which the different bryophyte species occur, are
	similar in these habitats, although many species are found on a
	variety of substrates, and there is a great need to correlate their
	physiological characteristics with these substrates, and to
	determine the latter more precisely, if we are to understand the
	factors which ultimately govern stability.
<p>The
	apparent weak elevational effect, presumably a result of lapse rate
	cooling,  registered in the southwest ascent of Crawford mountain
	was referred to earlier. However we have seen that it appears to be
	mirrored and possibly exceeded in effect by subsidence of cool air
	in Chimney Hollow. This conclusion must however be qualified by
	consideration of the great differences in the summit and Hollow
	floras. While the summit flora might be classed submesotrophic or
	more nutrient rich  (Rawinski, 1998),  with species such as Coral
	Berry, that of the Hollow has many areas that rank as oligotrophic..
	For example, certain acidiphile species such as Early Low Blueberry
	may be excluded on the summit on the basis of soil pH and nutrient
	composition rather than temperature.
<p>The
	ridge and summit areas of Crawford Mountain join many other ridge
	and summit areas in these mountains that are characterized  by mesic
	floras. In some cases this may result from the favorable occurrence
	of nutrient - rich rock strata and consequent moisture retaining
	soils. However,  mechanisms also exist that favor the accumulation
	of nutrients and moisture from the weathering of strata not
	particularly rich in nutrients. Such accumulation may result from
	relatively subdued summit microtopography that favors  the dominance
	of chemical and physical weathering over the erosive processes that
	transport weathering products down - slope  (see our section on
	Garden Mountain and Vicinity).   In Chimney Hollow mesic species,
	characteristic of relatively nutrient rich soils, are largely
	confined to the vicinity of seeps, while dryer areas tend to be
	oligotropic.
