  - When creating a database or a table, they directories/files are automatically CHMOD'd to 0755
    so that file permission errors are minimal
  - txtSQL requires that a column be present at all time in a table. This check was not enforced 
    when dropping a column (when there was only one left), so now it exists
  - The 'r_trim' and 'l_trim' functions now work properly
  - The 'permanent' attribute only comes into effect onyl when changing a value in that column,

    issues an error, and returns FALSE

  - When deleting, and no 'where clause' is specified, all rows are deleted simultaneously, rather
    than the one by one method

    modification of that row's column if the field is set to permanent however
