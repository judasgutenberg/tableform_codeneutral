txtSQL Notes
===================================================================================================
- If any errors occur, try CHMOD'ing the table files and its database folder to 0755 or higher

- If you forget you password, do the following; Delete the folder 'txtsql' inside of your data folder
  and install a fresh version of that folder from the zip file that can be downloaded on
  http://txtSQL.sf.net

- txtSQL often releases small bug fixes and updates, make sure you are keeping up-to-date with these
  releases, so that your script may function as intended.

- Before running txtSQLAdmin, make sure you edit your config.php file.

- Before running smNews, make sure that you read the readme

- When txtSQL.class.php is included in a php script and the txtSQL.core.php file is not in the same
  directory, then you must define a constant named 'TXTSQL_CORE_PATH' with the value of where the
  txtSQL.core.php file is located (no trailing slash). Either that, or you can change the relative
  path inside txtSQL.class.php to the full path of where txtSQL.core.php is located.
