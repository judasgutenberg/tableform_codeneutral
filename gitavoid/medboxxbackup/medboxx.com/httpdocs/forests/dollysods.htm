 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <ul>
<p>

<p> Dolly
 Sods is part of a dissected Allegheny Mountain Tableland that
 extends northeast twenty miles from the Roaring Plains to State
 Route 93. This tableland is bounded on the southeast by the
 imposing scarp of the Allegheny Front and on the northwest by Cabin
 Mountain and Canaan Valley. The geologic structure of this
 tableland is synclinal, with the edges formed by the Pottsville
 Sandstone and the interior by successively younger Allegheny
 formation and Conemagh Group which have more diverse lithologies,
 including beds of coal and limestone (Cardwell <i>et al</i>, 1968).
 All are of Pennsylvanian age. Because of its resistance to
 erosion, the Pottsville is prevalent in outcrops as light gray,
 conglomeratic sandstone. In many places this sandstone litters the
 countryside in large jumbled blocks. Many of these block fields are
 thought to be periglacial in origin and date to the glacial maximum
 and sometime thereafter when tundra is inferred to have occupied
 these heights. However much exposure of these rocks probably
 occurred during the period of logging and fires when deep organic
 soils of the spruce forest were burned and eroded away (Clarkson,
 1964).<p>
  Most of
 the southern part of the Tableland, including Dolly Sods, is drained
 by Red Creek, a branch of the Dry Fork of the Cheat River, while the
 northern part is drained by the Stony River, a branch of the
 Potomac. Much of the area is dominated by heath, but there are
 large areas of wetlands, recovering Red Spruce (<i>Picea rubens</i>) and northern hardwood forest. Where the tableland is deeply
 incised by Red Creek and on the Allegheny Front, there is a variety
 of forest types that reflect differences in elevation and moisture
 availability. Heath vegetation is largely developed on siliceous
 rocks such as the Pottsville Sandstone. Where more varied rock
 types occur in parts of the central region as along Red Creek,
 richer ecosystems occur as indicated by fish biomass and extensive
 Beaver colonies (Gaspar [Gasper], 1994).<p>
  The
 climate of the tableland is, if anything, more severe than that of
 Canaan Valley. Particularly characteristic are the strong west
 winds that have shaped many of the Spruce in banner forms by
 preventing the development of foliage on the windward side of
 crowns. However this too may in part be an artifact of the period
 of forest destruction when trees and soil were stripped from Cabin
 Mountain and other summits. Photographs of the virgin Spruce in at
 least parts of the tableland (Clarkson, 1964) do not show the banner
 forms but rather trees that are straight, tall and densely growing. 
 It seems likely that this original forest in such areas had a
 considerable moderating effect on the wind. However, trees on areas
 of Pottsville Sandstone, where growing conditions would always have
 been severe, might originally have had banner forms. 
<p> Although
 many of the same plants and animals occur here as in the Canaan
 Valley, some with southern ranges and with richer soil requirements
 drop out. Heaths such as cranberries are more common, as is Mountain
 Ash (<i>Pyrus americana</i>) and at least one additional boreal
 species, Three-toothed Cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla tridentata</i>),
 occupies exposed summits. Also found here however is a wetland
 plant Oceanorus (<i>Zigadenus leimanthoides</i>) which has a
 peculiar bimodal distribution along the Appalachian Mountains and
 the Atlantic coastal plain with no intermediate occurrences. Both
 Three - toothed Cinquefoil and Oceanorus are listed as rare by the
 West Virginia Natural Heritage Program.<p>

 <h2>Previous
 Work</h2>
<p>

<ul>

<p> This
 report builds on the works of Kennedy (1853), Lewis (1925), 
 Perkins (1929), Allard and Leonard (1952), Brooks (1963) and
 others referred to elsewhere in this report. Gibson
 (1970), in particular, surveyed the physical environment and flora
 of the Alder Run Bog, with the area of concentration in the vicinity
 of a Beaver (<i>Castor canadensis</i>) pond. One aspect of her
 study was a survey of pH values in various habitats and in waters
 associated with different floral types. These values ranged from 5.5
 in a<i>Glyceria </i>community on the west side of the pond to 3.6
 for water flowing into the south end of the pond from a sedge and 
 Sphagnum zone. The relation between these values, the flora and the
 geologic substrate was clearly recognized by her. She also
 identified a number of disjunct northern species that included
 <i>Juncus filiformis, Carex canescens, C. pauciflora, Scirpus 
 atrocinctus </i>, Bunchberry (<i>Cornus canadensis</i>), 
 Goldthread (<i>Coptis groenlandica</i>) and Star Violet (
 <i>Dalibarda repens</i>) . The northern moss <i>Depanocladus 
 fluitans</i>, also found by us at Maple Flats, was associated with
 certain hummocks.<i>Sphagnum recurvum </i>and <i>S. capillaceum</i>
 occurred on the south sides of hummocks and <i>S. capillaceum </i>var
 <i>tenellum</i> on the north side. As emphasized by Gaspar [ Gasper
 ] (1994 a) and Webb (1997), pH values and the general chemistry
 of soil and waters as well as the flora and fauna in the region are
 subject to the influence of air - borne pollutants from distant coal
 - fired power plants. Also, this factor may have gained in influence
 since Gibson did her study<i>. Luncus filiformis, Carex 
 canescens,Carex pauciflora, Scirpus atrocinctus,</i> Three -
 toothed Cinquefoil (alternatively <i>Sibbaldiopsis tridentata</i>), Goldthread (alternatively <i>Coptis trifolia</i>) and Star
 Violet are listed as rare by Natural Heritage. All are northern
 disjuncts, some far south of their normal ranges. <i>Juncus 
 filiformis,</i> <i>Carex canescens </i>and <i>Carex pauciflora</i>
 have a circumboreal distribution as well. Most are also associated
 with acid environments.

 <h2>Red
 Creek Campground and Vicinity</h2>

 <ul>
  The Red
 Creek Campground of the Monongahela National Forest, which is
 accessed by Forest Road 75, lies in the area of a Pottsville
 Sandstone outcrop just above the Allegheny Front. The topography is
 rolling, with distant views of the Tableland and North Fork Range. 
 A bog, Alder Run Bog, of perhaps 50 acres (20 hectares), occupies
 the head of a branch of Red Creek, Alder Run, south of the
 campground. A nature trail, the Northland Loop Trail, complete with
 a boardwalk, crosses the bog near the road. The Blackbird Knob
 Hiking Trail extends west from the campground, while a bird-banding
 station is located to the east on the Allegheny front. Elevations
 range from 3800 ft (1160 meters) in the Bog to almost 4000 ft (1220
 meters) on the upland. The upland in the vicinity of the campground
 varies between rocky heath, boggy seeps, shrubland, Red Spruce
 forest and Red Pine (<i>Pinus resinosa</i>) plantations. At this
 season, on the onset of autumn, leaves had begun to turn, Composite
 Family plants were still in bloom and the heath plants were heavy
 with fruit. Small migrant birds flitted through the shrubbery
 sheltering themselves from the wind and slanting rain. Among them
 also were local Juncos (<i>Junco hyemalis</i>) as well as Red
 Squirrels (<i>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</i>) .<p>
  Traverses
 in the camp vicinity and along the Blackbird Knob Trail disclosed
 the following canopy species: Red Spruce, Red Maple <i> (Acer 
 rubrum</i>), Yellow Birch (<i>Betula</i> <i>alleghaniensis</i>), 
 Black Cherry <i> (Prunus serotina</i>), Black Locust (<i>Robinia 
 pseudoacacia</i>), Pitch and Table Mountain Pines (<i>Pinus 
 rigida </i>and <i>P. pungens</i>) and Northern Red Oak (<i>Quercus
 rubra</i>) . A few stunted Black Gum (<i>Nyssa sylvatica</i>) 
 were also seen. Red Pine is confined to plantations and little or
 no reproduction of this species was seen. Virtually all canopy
 species are small and appear stunted by the harsh conditions, while
 many spruce show banner forms and in this way indicate the
 prevailing wind direction. These normally larger species are
 accompanied by characteristically small trees such as Choke and Fire
 Cherries (<i>Prunus virginiana</i> and <i>P pensylvanica</i>), 
 Trembling and Bigtooth Aspens (Populus <i>tremuloides</i> and <i>P.
 grandidentata</i>), Smooth Service Berry ( <i>Amelanchier laevis</i>
), Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum </i>), hawthorn (
 <i>Crataegus</i> sp) and Mountain Ash, with the last-named bearing
 abundant berries. The shrub layer is very diverse with Black
 Chokeberry (<i>Aronia melanocarpa</i>), Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia
 pilosa</i>), Speckled Alder (<i>Alnus rugosa</i>) and the holly
 <i>Nemopanthus mucranata </i>among the most abundant. Other common
 species are Wild Raisin (Viburnum cassinoides), Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>), Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron 
 maximum</i>), Mountain Azalea (<i>Rhododendron roseum</i>), 
 Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana</i> ), Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis 
 virginiana</i>), Winterberry Holly (<i>Ilex verticillata</i>), 
 Upland Willow (<i>Salix humilis</i>), Glade St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum densiflorum</i>), Pipestem (<i>Spiraea alba</i>) 
 Black Huckleberry (<i>Gaylussacia baccata</i>), Gooseberry (<i>Ribes </i>sp), various species of Blackberries, Sourtop, Early
 Low and Upland Low (<i>Vaccinium myrtilloides, V. angustifolium
 </i>and <i>V. pallidum</i>) Blueberries and Bear Oak (<i>Quercus 
 ilicifolia</i>) . A number of these - <i>Nemopanthus</i>, Wild
 Raisin, Glade St. Johns-wort, Pipestem, Speckled Alder, Winterberry
 Holly- will be recognized as wetland species and are usually
 confined to the moister areas. A conspicuous characteristic of
 Minnie-bush throughout the area was its apparently diseased and
 degraded condition that seemed to go beyond seasonal effects.<p>
  Ground
 cover in heath areas is dominated by acid soil species such as
 Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>), Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigaea repens</i>), Ground Berry (<i>Rubus hispidus</i>), 
 Large and Small Cranberries (<i>Vaccinium macrocarpon </i>and <i>V.
 oxycoccos</i>), Sphagnum and <i>Polytrichum </i>mosses, <i>Cladina </i>
 and <i>Cladonia </i>lichens. Associates are Bog Goldenrod (<i>
 Solidago uliginosa</i>), Narrow-leaved Gentian (<i>Gentiana
 linearis</i>), Cotton Sedge (<i>Eriophorum virginicum</i>), as
 well as other sedges and a few grasses. Other, perhaps less acid,
 seeps may contain Arrow - leaf Tear Thumb (<i>Polygonum sagittatum</i>
), Small-flowering St. Johns-wort, sedges and wetland grasses such
 as Rice Cutgrass (<i>Leersia oryzoides</i>) and Drooping Wood
 Reedgrass (<i>Cinna latifolia</i>) . In adjacent dry open areas
 flourish Flat-top White Aster (<i>Aster umbellatus</i>),
 Grass-leaved Goldenrod (<i>Euthamia graminifolia</i>), 
 Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa</i>) and Bracken Fern
 (<i>Pteridium acquilinum</i>) . On rocky hilltops at this season
 was Wild Bleeding-heart (<i>Dicentra exima</i>) still bloomed among
 blocks of conglomerate, while Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia 
 punctilobula</i> was frost-browned at the forest edge. Although
 expected in mossy forest enclaves, Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum
 canadense</i>) was nowhere abundant and, perhaps fortuitously, no
 Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella </i> <i>repens</i>), a usual
 inhabitant of cool acidic environments, was seen on these traverses.<p>
  A night
 of wind and driving rain was followed by a visit to Alder Run Bog. 
 Here a classic boreal scene was enhanced by an Osprey (<i>Pandion 
 haliaetus</i>) perched on a snag. The open bog, in places showing
 only a foot deep veneer of peat over conglomerate, consists in part
 of a Sphagnum-dominated plain and in part of sedge meadow with a
 little open water. Rimming these open areas are shrubs with a
 backdrop of Red Spruce swamp forest with minor Red Maple, perhaps in
 display of vegetational succession. A few contorted Pitch Pine
 are scattered over the open bog as well. The Sphagnum community, in
 addition to unidentified species of this moss, contains abundant
 lichens, Small Cranberries (at this season almost ripe) and <i>Rubus
 hispidus.</i> In places there are hummocks, some 3 feet (1 meter)
 high with small seedlings of Black Chokeberry, Wild Raisin and other
 shrubs, or usually on the north side, scattered small colonies of
 Goldthread. With an admixture of sedges the Sphagnum bog grades
 into sedge meadow, a community dominated by robust clumps of <i>Carex
 folliculata</i>, abundant Cotton Sedge and leaf rosettes of Bog
 Goldenrod. Narrow-leaved Gentian is scattered throughout.<p>
  The
 shrub border of the open bog consists largely of<i>Nemopanthus</i>,
 Speckled Alder and lesser amounts of Black Chokeberry, Wild Raisin
 and Mountain Laurel. Under and among the Red Spruce these shrubs
 are joined by Sourtop Blueberry, Early Low Blueberry, Southern
 Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium</i> <i>erythrocarpum</i>), <i>Rubus
 hispidus</i>, a little Canada Mayflower and abundant Teaberry. 
 Despite the proximity of the road, the wild character of the bog
 asserted itself in the form of a large Black Bear (<i>Ursus 
 americanus</i>) who inadvertently appeared near to one of us while
 sketching the scene. The presence of this animal during the day
 probably reflected the urgency of the berry harvest in preparation
 for the severe weather soon to come on this highland. Our drive out
 of the area was also enlivened by a beautiful Coopers Hawk (<i>
 Accipiter cooperii</i>) that flew before us and perched on the
 road edge.<p>
  It is
 apparent that the Dolly Sods area is undergoing successional
 recovery and that if this process is allowed to continue without
 human interference or climatic change, it will result in the
 re-establishment of a conifer forest predominantly of Red Spruce. 
 The existing heath vegetation, northern hardwoods and shrublands
 mark intermediate stages in this recovery. An additional factor
 stressed by Gaspar (1994) and others is the effect of acid
 precipitation which results from distant and nearby pollution
 sources and which is affecting both water quality and forest health.
 Since Red Spruce is more vulnerable to this type of pollution than
 deciduous species, it could work counter to the natural succession
 and recovery.<p>

 Walks: 8-8-02 and 8-9-02</b>
 
<ul>
<p> Our
 visit here was during very pleasant, almost clear weather, with
 temperature highs in the 70s deg F, and little wind. 
<p> With
 a desire for a greater degree of completeness than that achieved on
 our 1993 visit, four inventory traverses were conducted. The first
 of these was in a seep area in the vicinity of the Red Creek
 Campground, the second along the trail leading to the bird - banding
 station on the Allegheny Front cliffs. The third inventory was of
 the Alder Run Bog and its approach, while the fourth was a brief
 foray up the Blackbird Knob Trail.<p>
  Our
 first inventory began a little before noon on 8 - 8 - 02 in the seep
 area near camp. The elevation here is near 3890 feet (1186 m) asl,
 the aspect essentially flat. The low canopy of secondary forest
 consisted largely of Red Maple and Black Cherry. Under this canopy a
 soil temperature determination (T - 506) was made at the usual
 depth of 5 inches (13 cm) in a wet, dark organic soil. It was
 found to be T= 16 deg C.<p>
  A water
 sample was also taken from the seep. Obtained from this rather muddy
 water was a pH value of 4.9.<p>
  Trees in
 the open, adjacent to the seep area, were Trembling Aspen, Smooth
 Serviceberry and Fire Cherry. Striped Maple was a common understory
 species<p>
  Shrubs
 observed here included abundant Speckled Alder, Witch Hazel, Great
 Rhododendron, Mountain Laurel, <i>Nemopanthus,</i> Mountain Holly,
 Thornless Blackberry (<i>Rubus canadensis</i>), Smooth Gooseberry
 (<i>Ribes rotundifolium</i>), Black Chokeberry and, in the open,
 Upland Willow. Ground Berry (<i>Rubus hispidus</i>) was abundant
 in the ground cover in the vicinity of the seep.<p>
  It
 should be mentioned that a little Silky Willow <i> (Salix sericea</i>) was also observed in a similar seep nearby.<p>
  Herbs
 found in the mostly shaded seep area included Arrowleaf Tearthumb,
 Hay-scented Fern, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod, Mountain Oat Grass (
 <i>Danthonia compressa</i>), Fowl Mannagrass (<i>Glyceria 
 striata</i>), abundant, strikingly tall Drooping Wood Reedgrass,
 Mountain Aster (<i>Aster acuminatus</i>), Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda
 cinnamomea</i>), Dotted St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum punctatum</i>), Crinkled Hairgrass (<i>Deschampsia flexuosa</i>), Autumn bent
 Grass (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>), Purple-stem Aster (<i>Aster 
 puniceus</i>), Mountain Woodfern (<i>Dryopteris campyloptera</i>), a little of the alien Orchard Grass (<i>Dactylis glomerata</i>), the rush <i>Juncuc canadensis</i> var <i>canadensis</i>, the
 mannagrass <i>Glyceria melicaria</i>, the sedges <i>Carex debilis,
 C, C. baileyi, C.</i> <i>gynandra, C. normalis, C. atlantica
 and C. scoparium,</i> Clayton's Bedstraw (<i>Galium </i>
 tinctorium), American Brooklime (<i>Veronica americana</i>), the
 aliens Velvet Grass (<i>Holcus </i> <i>lanatus</i>), Rough
 Bluegrass <i> (Poa trivialis</i>), Bitter Dock (<i>Rumex 
 obtusifolius</i>) and Thyme-leaved Speedwell (<i>Veronica 
 serpyllifolia</i>), Rice Cutgrass, Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>), Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus</i>) and Fowl
 Bluegrass (<i>Poa</i> <i>palustris</i>) .<p>
  Noted
 quite generally were the cries of Ravens <i> (Corvus corax</i>) 
 and the common occurrence of seedlings and/or sprouts of Trembling
 Aspen.<p>
  Later in
 the afternoon a traverse was made along the trail that leads to the
 bird - banding station on the Allegheny Front cliffs. Moving through
 largely open habitat, we successively noted Glade St. Johns-wort in
 full bloom, Black Huckleberry with fruit beginning to ripen, Bog
 Goldenrod in bloom, the alien Canada Bluegrass (<i>Poa compressa</i>), Early low Blueberry in fruit, Flat - top White Aster (<i>Aster 
 umbellatus</i>), <i>Rubus hispidus</i>, Mountain Ash, abundant
 small Red Spruce with branches to the ground, Mountain Laurel, Hay -
 scented Fern, Grass - leaved Goldenrod, New York Fern (T<i>helypteris
 noveboracensis</i>), a single Bear Oak, Trembling Aspen, Red
 Maple, common Mountain Azalea (<i>Rhododendron roseum</i>) and
 Black Cherry.<p>
  Now
 deviating slightly from the trail and beneath the low canopy of Red
 Maple, we found Stiff Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium annontinum</i>), 
 small <i>Nemopanthus</i>, Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium virginianum</i>), Canada Mayflower and a seedling of Mountain ash. Then in the open
 again, we noted the &quot;fireweed&quot;<i>Erechtites hieracifolia
 </i>, more <i>Rubus hispidus</i>, followed by Smooth Gooseberry,
 Crinkled Hairgrass, Black Cherry, Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia
 </i> <i>quadrifolia</i>), the alien Field Sorrel (<i>Rumex 
 acetosella</i>), Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium </i> <i>flabelliforme</i>), Cinnamon Fern, Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris 
 intermedia</i>), Common Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium clavatum</i>), 
 Minnie - bush and Mountain Laurel.<p>
  We now
 arrived at the edge of the Allegheny Front cliffs, where we observed
 a single small Northern Red Oak, which bore the thick form of leaf
 (&quot; sun leaf&quot;) we had also found on the summit of Reddish
 Knob (see a photo from the latter site) and other high elevation
 summits. Found in the vicinity were Red Fescue (<i>Festuca rubra
 </i>), Heath Aster (<i>Aster pilosus</i>), Pennsylvania
 Blackberry (<i>Rubus pensilvanicus</i>), the aliens Timothy (
 <i>Phleum pratense</i>), Mouse - ear Chickweed (<i>Cerastrum 
 viscosum</i>), Chamomile (<i>Matricarium chamomila</i>) and Ox -
 eye Daisy (<i>Chrysanthemum leucanthemum</i>) . Of greatest
 interest, however, was the rare northern disjunct Bristly
 sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia hispida</i>), which, growing from a cleft
 in rock, bore a robust cluster of dark blue berries. Flowers of this
 plant are a favorite source of nectar for the very rare (State Rank
 S1) Pink - edged Sulphur (<i>Colias interior</i>) Butterfly. the
 larvae of which feed on blueberry vegetation. Allen (1993) has
 provided a detailed discussion of this and other northern disjunct
 butterflies, both rare and more common.<p>
  The rock
 exposures along the Allegheny Front are substrates for an
 interesting assemblage of lichens, including such Arctic species as
 <i>Arctoparmelia centrifuga</i> and <i>Melanelia disjuncta</i> (
 Dey, 1993) .<p>
  Also
 part of the cliff flora were Bracken Fern, the aliens Coltsfoot (
 Tussilago farfara) and Golden Clover (<i>Trifolium aureum</i>), 
 White snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium rugosum</i>) not yet in bloom, Cow
 Wheat (<i>Melampyrum lineare</i>) in bloom, Daisy Fleabane (
 <i>Erigeron annuus</i>), Witch Hazel, Bleeding Heart in its usual
 habitat among large sandstone blocks and, seemingly out of place,
 Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>) in the same
 location. Two other northern/high elevation plants were Mountain
 Bindweed (<i>Polygonum cilinode</i>) and Skunk Current (<i>Ribes
 glandulosum</i>) . Also heard here was a Towhee (<i>Pipilo 
 erythrophthalmus</i>) . A Black Birch (<i>Betula lenta</i>) was
 observed on our return walk.<p>
  On the
 morning of 8-9-02, under almost clear skies, and pleasant (mid
 70s deg F) temperatures, we descended the gentle slope along the
 road to Alder Run Bog. Black-capped Chickadees (<i>Parus 
 atricapillus</i>) called from the road-side, where we also
 recognized an alien species of some interest. This was Morrow's
 Honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera morrowi</i>), which appears to be stable
 under a quite large range of climates, as it is common in the
 Shenandoah Valley.<p>
  From the
 road a slight incline through an open Spruce forest and dense
 ericaceous shrubland leads to the Bog proper. Our inventory was
 initiated at a position on this slope, which had an essentially west
 aspect. and not far from the road, at an elevation of about 3850
 feet (1174 m) asl. We were here in the midst of an extremely dense
 shrub and ground flora dominated by ericaceous plants and small Red
 Spruce saplings. As we moved down-slope, we successively noted the
 following: Spring Bluets (<i>Houstonia caerulea</i>) in bloom, a
 <i>Cladina</i> lichen with the appearance of <i>Cladina 
 rangiferina</i>, abundant Rubus hispidus, which attested to the
 presence of abundant seeps underfoot; also Early Low Blueberry in
 fruit, Mountain Laurel, abundant Teaberry, a little of the alien
 Black Medic (<i>Medicago lupulina</i>), Stiff Clubmoss, <i>Carex 
 debilis, </i>Black Chokeberry, Bunchberry (<i>Cornus canadensis</i>), 
 Crinkled Hairgrass, Narrow - leaf Gentian in bloom and Tree Clubmoss
 (Lycopodium obscurum) .<p>
  Continuing
 down - slope, we next recorded the rush <i>Juncus effusus</i> and
 the unusual disjunct Oceanorus, also in full bloom; then <i>Carex 
 folliculata </i>Wild Raisin, the haircap moss of severe terrain
 <i>Polytrichum juniperinum</i>, followed by Bog Goldenrod and Small
 Cranberry with unripe berries.<p>
  Here a
 soil sample (no 1) was taken from the usual depth of 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) . On taking this sample it was found difficult to break
 through the extremely dense mat of interlocking roots. The soil
 recovered was rich in un-decayed fibers immediately beneath the root
 mat, but fine grained and very dark beneath this. A pH of 4.3 was
 obtained for a mix of this material both initially and 24 hours
 later.<p>
  Again
 moving down slope, we encountered Cinnamon Fern, White Beakrush (
 <i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) in bloom, Mountain oat Grass, the first
 Cotton Sedge just beginning to head out and the northern rush <i>Juncus
 brevicaudatus</i>. Scattered mushroom - shaped <i>Nemopanthus</i>
 shrubs were also present here.<p>
  We had
 now reached an area of diminished slope and entered the Bog proper.
 A characteristic of this terrain, which however still pointed to a
 significant slope, was the presence of erosion channels occupied by
 flowing springbrooks that were directed toward the pond area
 described by Gibson (1970) . These channels exposed a cross-section
 of dark organic soil, likely peat, which in places was of the order
 of a meter in depth above an irregular surface of the white
 Pottsville conglomeratic sandstone. In places large projections or
 fragments of this rock protruded above the surface. As pointed out
 by Gibson and found to be the case in our 1993 visit, the Bog
 surface is hummocky in places, and different plants not only occur
 on the hummocks and intervening depressions, but also on different
 sides of the hummocks. 
<p> Soil
 sample no 2 was now taken from the surface mud of a small, almost
 stagnant pondlet . The pH values of this soil were 4.8 and 4.7
 initially and 24 hours later respectively .The elevation at this
 point was probably near 3830 feet (1168 m) asl.<p>
  Still
 traversing down - slope, we noted the presence of well - spaced but
 common and blooming Narrow - leaf Gentian, White Beakrush and
 Oceanorus. A noteworthy occurrence also was the continued presence
 of Crinkled Hairgrass, although of a straggly nature and bearing
 only a few culms per clump as distinguished from its luxuriant
 character at Reddish Knob, for example.<p>
  In one
 place, on another muddy flat, we came upon a small colony (see
 photo) of the boreal Bog Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium innundatum</i>) .<p>
  Another
 feature of interest was the continued presence of the normally
 upland species Early Low Blueberry on the hummocks, but not in the
 intervening depressions, a characteristic also of this plant in the
 <a href=bigrunbog.htm>Big Run Bog</a> (Hunsucker et al, 1995) . Found here for the first time
 on our traverse was Sourtop Blueberry, which is stable under more
 moist conditions than its upland congener. These were also
 accompanied by Clayton's Bedstraw on the hummocks. As noted in our
 1993 visit, Small Cranberry commonly occupied the depressions with a
 number of species of <i>Sphagnum</i> moss serving as a colorful
 background, a feature also shared with Big Run Bog.<p>
  Now, in
 the distance to the west, there could be seen a short but robust
 Pitch Pine, while, close at hand we tallied Northern Bugleweed, 
 Cinnamon Fern, abundant large rock protrusions and in a meter - deep
 streamlet channel, the hybrid northern manna grass <i>Glyceria </i>
 <i>laxa</i>.<p>
  We soon
 came upon another quite deep and prominent channel in which we found
 the following: Sundew (<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>) - also listed
 as rare by Natural Heritage _ bearing insect prey, Purple - leaved
 Willow-herb (<i>Epilobium coloratum</i>), Arrow-leaf Tearthumb,
 Canadian St. Johns - wort (<i>Hypericum</i> <i>canadensis</i>), 
 <i>Carex atlantica, C. baileyi, C. scoparius, Juncus effusus</i>,
 the thallus liverwort <i>Pellia epiphylla </i>and two unidentified
 species of the moss <i>Philonotus</i>. one of which later was
 identified as the northern acidiphile <i>Philonotus fontana</i> by
 R. Hunsucker. These were accompanied on the bank by Indian Tobacco (
 <i>Lobelia inflata</i>) and the two aliens Ox - eye Daisy and the
 hawkweed <i>Hieracium cespitosum</i>. 
<p> After
 passing another wet area which contained <i>Eleocharis tenuis,
 Juncus tenuis, Scirpus cyperinus </i>and <i>Glyceria striata</i>,
 we arrived a the conspicuous Pitch Pine - which we now saw was on a
 substantial elevation of perhaps a 2/3 meter, and surrounded by
 several small but vigorous saplings that were likely seeded by this
 tree, as it bore numerous cones.<p>
 A
 little to the north another surprise awaited us, namely a fair sized
 Table Mountain Pine<i> (Pinus pungens</i>), healthy - appearing,
 but somewhat contorted by the elements (see photo) . Like the Pitch
 Pine, it was on an elevation, but in this case, one with an exposed
 rock surface. Also present in the vicinity were Pitch Pines, one of
 which had fallen and had its tip - up pit filled with water. Pitch
 pines appear to have the capacity to grow in shallow and relatively
 dry, acid soils above what may be incompatible substrates such as
 limestone, or, as in this case, water - saturated soil. It seems
 possible that this tree had once grown in a relatively dry spot, but
 had later been killed by natural processes that changed the local
 drainage and directed water to the spot.<p>
  On the
 approach of the noon hour, our last observations in the Bog were an
 unidentified<i>Omphalina </i>fungus, Rice Cutgrass, a Pearl
 Crescent (<i>Phyciodes tharos</i>) Butterfly, a few small
 grasshoppers, Winterberry Holly, blooming Yellow Bartonia (<i>Bartonia</i>
 <i>virginica</i>) and a single dragonfly. Then returning to the
 road by a different route along the Spruce forest edge, we noted the
 presence there of Mountain Azalea as well as an unidentified species
 of Pussytoes (<i>Antennaria</i> sp).<p>
  The
 following mosses (Crum and Anderson, 1981) from the Bog were
 identified by R. Hunsucker:<p>
 <ul>
 <i>Brachythecium
 </i> sp - on hummocks <br>
 <i>Bryum </i>
 sp (strile) - on hummocks <br>
 <i>Leucobryum
 glaucum </i>- on hummocks <br>
 <i>Philonotus

  Part of
 our afternoon of 8-9-02 was occupied by a short traverse up the
 Blackbird Knob Trail. This trail at first crosses a small alder
 swamp on a boardwalk. Conspicuous in the openings between Speckled
 Alder were Pipestem and Glade St. Johns-wort, both in fill bloom,
 and accompanying these, Pnicled Aster (<i>Aster simplex</i>) and
 <i>Scirpus atrovirens</i>, among other tall herbs. 
<p> Leading
 up - slope, the trail passed through groves of the hawthorn
 <i>Crataegus</i> <i>macrosperma,</i> then entered a stand of Red
 Spruce. Here we recorded an unidentified species of the fungus
 <i>Inocybe</i>, Black - capped Chickadees, Witch Hazel and Sweet
 White Violet (<i>Viola </i> <i>blanda</i>) ; then in an opening,
 Dotted St. Johns-wort, New York Fern, Indian Hemp (<i>Apocynum 
 cannabinum</i>), more large hawthorns, Mountain Aster and Common
 Clubmoss.<p>
  Climbing
 more steeply now, we encountered bedrock outcroppings of what
 appeared to be a sandstone different from the Pottsville. A little
 beyond this we came upon Witch Hazel with much consumed foliage and
 with individual leaves crowded with the larvae of a lepidopteron
 about 2 cm in length. These were covered with hair, gray in color,
 and longer at head and tail. A little farther on there were large
 multi - stemmed Mountain Holly, mature Yellow Birch and Red maple,
 the fungi <i>Scleroderma citrinum</i> and an unidentified <i>Ramaria</i>;
 then Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>), Smooth
 Seviceberry, more Hay - scented Fern, Panicled Aster, <i>Carex 
 laxiflora, </i>Creeping Five - leaf, European Self - heal, Golden
 Ragwort, Mountain Oat Grass and, far off the trail, Mountain
 Woodfern. 
<p> We
 now entered a Red Pine plantation with virtually no shrub
 undergrowth or ground flora. Then, moving again into deciduous
 growth, we observed a Common Yellowthroat (<i>Geothlypis trichas</i>) 
 Warbler and a Turkey Vulture (<i>Cathartes aura</i>) soaring
 overhead. Here also were large shrubs of Smooth Gooseberry, Flat -
 top White Aster, Mountain Laurel, Thornless Blackberry, Ground Pine,
 <i>Rubus hispidus</i> and Sourtop Blueberry.<p>
 Other
 species identified on our return walk were Common Sundrop (<i>Oenothera tetragona</i>), a moisture - loving species of the
 genus, and the Spikerush Eleocharis ovata.<p>
  Fauna
 seen and/or heard around camp included Cedar Waxwings (<i>Bombycilla</i>
 <i>cedrorum</i>), Woodcock (<i>Scolopax minor</i>), a few large
 yellow grasshoppers at one location, and at another, in deep grass,
 numerous small (~ 1 cm), but different members of the same order.
 While bird life was generally scarce compared to our September, 1993
 visit, a good number of unidentified sightings were had. Of some
 interest also was the observation of Blueberry Stem Gall, which is
 caused by a gall wasp, and which produces swellings on the side of
 the stem.<p>

 <h2>Summary
 and Comparison With  <a href=bigrunbog.htm>Big Run Bog</a></h2>
 <ul>
<p>

<p>Although
 difficult to detail from our somewhat cursory inventories, there is
 at Dolly Sods an emerging pattern of the connection between bedrock,
 associated waters and soils and the various floras observed, first
 by Gibson (1970), and now by us. Most obvious is the association
 or ericaceous shrublands and upland heaths with the acidic, nutrient
 - poor Pottsville and other sandstones. Also, as shown by Gibson,
 and, as expected, some of the lowest pH waters are equilibrated with
 Sphagnum mosses in the Bog. Apparently, and again as expected, some
 upland seeps, one of which was the object of our first 2002
 inventory, contain waters that apparently have contacted bedrock
 less acid than that where they emerge. This results in floras with a
 diversity of herbs and non-ericaceous woody plants rather than
 Sphagnum and the ericaceous shrubs. Most conspicuous of the former
 are alder swamps, Spiraea and St. Johns - wort thickets and &quot;glades&quot;
 with Blue Joint <i> (Calamagrostis canadensis</i>) and other
 grasses (see our <a href=canaanv.htm>section on Canaan Valley</a>) . While it is generally
 concluded that the upper Red Creek Basin, which occupies much of
 Dolly Sods, is so acid that it presents marginal fish habitat, there
 is variation (Webb, 1997) . Reference to the geologic map (
 Cardwell et al, 1968) indicates that the least acidic parts of the
 Basin should coincide with the Conemaugh Group rocks in the center.
 This is also hinted at by Gaspar [ Gasper ] (1994 b) who called
 attention to the large number of Beaver ponds in the area, and
 mentions a certain &quot;richness&quot; in the food supply for fish.
 However, according to this same author, the shallowness of these
 ponds results in high water temperatures that also restrict fish
 habitat as well as species diversity. The presence of rich - soil
 areas within the Dolly Sods Wilderness is further indicated by some
 of the superb photographs of Jonathan Jessup, which show extensive
 wetlands apparently covered by grasses, including possibly Blue
 Joint (<a href=http://www.jonathanjessup.com/ target=jj>Jonathan Jessup's Nature Photographs</a>, 2002 early summer
 trip, p36) .<p>
 Dolly
 sods also has a lot to contribute to our knowledge of the stability
 of species with respect to air and soil temperatures and moisture
 content. Climatic data presented by Gibson (1970) indicate highly
 variable winter temperatures and generally cool conditions during
 the growing season. Temperature, in particular, is directly
 indicative of climate change, which is of increasing concern.
 Evidence of reproduction, or lack thereof, in boreal or high montane
 species such as the northern sedges and rushes, Red Spruce,
 <i>Nemopanthus, </i>Bunchberry and Bristly Sarsaparilla, which are
 on the edges of their ranges, could be monitored and correlated with
 growing season soil temperatures with relative ease (Mueller, 2002,
 2003) . In addition to these rare disjuncts, the severe growing
 season climate of the area sharpens the division within genera that
 results in segregations characteristic of the high Alleghenies in
 general. Thus, among the Asteraceae, Bog, Wrinkle - leaf and Grass
 - leaved Goldenrods and Flat - top White, Purple - stem and Mountain
 Asters, which are generally abundant among many species of the
 family in the high Alleghenies, here occur to the virtual exclusion
 of the others.. Furthermore, all six of these species range farther
 north than virtually any other species of these two genera in the
 Alleghenies (Gleason, 1952), certainly an indication that
 temperature is an important factor in the floristics here. The same
 restriction is not as true of the ericaceae, which are well -
 represented by Appalachian species, although among <i>Vaccinium</i>,
 northern species greatly dominate all others. Perhaps most striking,
 however is the apparent low species diversity of vascular plants, 
 despite habitat diversity, when compared to many upland as well as
 lowland areas, another indication of climatically severe growing
 conditions. Also of interest is the apparent absence here of the
 north - ranging Canada Goldenrod (<i>Solidago canadensis</i>), 
 which is a common component of floras in calcareous terrain
 throughout the Central Appalachians. It is likely that it is
 excluded by the prevailingly acid soils. Additionally, it should be
 noted that Bristly Sarsaparilla, a species that is favored by dry
 conditions (Gleason, 1952), is, in this normally moist terrain,
 probably confined to rock outcrops or other habitat where drying is
 rapid after precipitation.<p>
 It is
 interesting to compare other features of Dolly Sods with those of
 the Big Run Bog (<a href=bigrunbog.htm>Hunsucker <i>et al</i> 1995</a>) already referred
 to. A salient feature of Big Run Bog is its resemblance to an
 ombotrophic bog rather than a minerotrophic fen as might be expected
 from its position in a basin that receives drainage from surrounding
 uplands. Important there, however, are the underlying rocks, not
 only beneath the Bog, but also beneath the entire drainage area
 occupied by northern hardwood forest. These rocks are apparently
 dominated by the most siliceous and hence most acidic members of the
 Pottsville Group and Allegheny Formation, essentially the same rocks
 as those that rim Dolly Sods, as along the Allegheny Front. The
 acidic and nutrient - poor character of soils in the northern
 hardwood forest above Big Run Bog are indicated by its depauperate
 flora relative to what might normally be expected in this forest
 type. A number of trees and other woody plants that occur under
 these climatic conditions in this forest type elsewhere in the
 Central Appalachians are here either missing or infrequent
 Apparently absent are White Ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>), 
 basswood (<i>Tilia </i>sp), Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya virginiana
 </i>), Muscletree (<i>Carpinus caroliniana</i>), hawthorns (<i>Crataegus </i> sp) and Mountain Maple (<i>Acer spicatum</i>). Sugar Maple, a species somewhat more tolerant of these
 conditions, is of infrequent occurrence. However, Beech, more
 tolerant of acid conditions than Sugar Maple, is abundant in the
 northern hardwood forest and Red Maple and Red Spruce, among the
 most acid - loving species, are either frequent or abundant in most
 habitats of the area (Hunsucker <i>et al</i> 1995) .These relations
 are in agreement with the behavior of these species wherever they
 occur throughout the Central Appalachians (Mueller, 2000) .
 Similarly herbs in the northern hardwood forest at Big Run Bog are
 almost confined to acidiphiles of either wide or boreal
 distribution, while most species indicative of more nutrient - rich
 soils and more alkaline conditions are absent or very infrequent.
 Examples of such missing herbs are many of the crowfoot family (
 Ranunculaceae) such as Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicfuga racemosa</i>), 
 the barberry family ( Berberaceae) such as Blue Cohosh (
 <i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i>) and all mints (Labiatae) 
 except Northern Bugleweed <i> (Lycopus uniflorus</i>) . Among
 grasses even Crinkled Hairgrass, a common constituent of cold
 acidic forests and widely occurring at Dolly Sods, is apparently
 absent at Big Run Bog.<p>
 The
 extreme acidic and nutrient - poor character of the northern
 hardwood forest is reflected in the waters that drain from it into
 Big Run Bog and the Bog's resultant flora. Apparently absent from
 the Bog is Speckled Alder, a common shrub at Dolly Sods, including
 Alder Run Bog, despite its acid character. Also absent from Big Run
 Bog is spiraea and many herbs that are common in seeps at Dolly
 Sods. Missing also are such constituents of Alder Run Bog as
 Ocenorus and Crinkled Hairgrass. 
<p>The
 Big Run Bog watershed is apparently simpler in its geologic and
 chemical characteristics than is the Dolly Sods Area. This is in
 part a matter of size, but also of the fortuitous placement of
 underlying rock. The considerable diversity that is still present at
 Big Run Bog, and which includes such rare plants as Buckbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), is attributable to the diversity of
 habitat in this relatively small area.<p>
 Many of
 the same plants that are missing at Big Run Bog are apparently also
 missing in the area inventoried by us at Dolly Sods and some not
 present there do occur at Big Run Bog. Particularly notable is the
 absence in both areas of White Ash and Black Ash (<i>Fraxinus 
 nigra</i>), a common species in richer wetlands in the High
 Alleghenies. While hawthorn occurs at Dolly Sods, neither Beech nor 
 Sugar Maple were observed there, perhaps in part due to the absence
 of significant mature forest in the area inventoried. Also of
 interest is the apparent absence of Creeping Snowberry (<i>Gaultheria
 hispidula</i>) at Alder Run Bog and its occurrence in similar
 habitat at Big Run Bog. 
<p>The
 Dolly Sods and Big Run Bog Areas are important sources of ecological
 information about northern and montane species and vegetation types,
 because they represent extreme habitats useful in the determination
 of the limits of the stability fields of species, either included
 or excluded. As such they are analogous to areas like Maple Flats in
 other vegetation types (see our <a href=mapleflats.htm>section on Maple Flats</a>) .<p><p>

 Wind Power Alert Addendum</h1></a>
<ul>
<p>

 
 Recently
 the Allegheny Front and some adjacent areas such as Backbone
 Mountain have come under the threat of Wind Power development. On
 Backbone Mountain the requisite 300 foot or more - tall towers are
 already in place. Although touted as &quot;:green power&quot; this
 form of energy has the following negatives: 
 

<p>

1.
 It is not&quot; pollution free&quot; since it depends on a variety
 of polluting support industries such as mining and manufacturing,
 and after use this &quot;clean&quot; wind energy is degraded into
 the same high entropy heat and used - up materials as any other
 energy form (Mueller, 1971}.<p>
 
 2.
  It
 requires an extensive infrastructure of roads, power lines and other
 features that degrade the unique ecosystems and aesthetic values of
 exposed areas such as mountain ridges.<p>
 
 3.
  Most
 wind turbines produce only of the order of one or two megawatts of
 power per unit at peak operation winds, so at least 1000 windmills
 would be required to equal the output of one large power plant. It
 is difficult to visualize the amount of ridge top required to make a
 significant dent in our power supply needs (Gfroerer,2002) .<p>
 4.
  Wind
 power does not really replace other forms of power; it is only
 another source of supply for our glutonous life style (Rogers, 2002). 
As such it would only encourage more consumption. What is really
 needed is <i>less</i> <i>power</i>, through increased efficiency - 
 and an end to our wasteful life style!<p>
 5.
  The
 Allegheny Front is a unique ecosystem, scenic area and a critical
 flyway for migrating birds. The impact of wind machines on birds and
 other wildlife here is still largely unknown, but negative impacts
 elsewhere have been documented (The reader is urged to explore the
 extensive internet resources on &quot; Wind Power and Birds&quot;
 through the search engines. These reveal large impacts indeed.).
 The visual impact of the towers is completely clear, however. They
 are, and more of them would be an intolerable blot on the high
 scenic values of one of West Virginia's greatest tourist
 attractions. 
 
 
<p> The
 concerned reader is urged to contact public officials and support
 organizations such as the <a  href=http://www.wvhighlands.org/ >West Virginia Highlands Conservancy</a> that
 are in the forefront of protection of this outstanding ecosystem.<p>
