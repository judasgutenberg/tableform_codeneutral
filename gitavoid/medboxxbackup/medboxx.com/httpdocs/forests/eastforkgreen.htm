<p><h1>East Fork Greenbrier
Watershed</h1>
<b>Pocahontas County, West
Virginia</b><br>
<b>November, 2003</b>
<blockquote>
 


 
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
 <ul>
<p>	The main stem and
tributaries of the East Fork of the Greenbrier mainly flow in valley
swaths of Devonian Chemung Group Rocks. However, Hampshire Formation,
also of Devonian Age, occupies much of the upper Watershed. The
Chemung consists largely of gray and brown siltstone and sandstone,
with shale and conglomerate interbeds, and is mainly of marine
origin. The Hampshire Formation is non-marine, and consists of
shales and fine micaceous sandstone, mostly red to brownish-gray
and also includes some siltstone, other sandstone and conglomerate (Cardwell et al. 1968)  The inventories reported on here were all
conducted in the vicinity of the Island campground of the Monongahela
National Forest northeast of Thornwood, West Virginia. The River bed
load and coarser flood plain alluvium consist of  bouldery cobble,
smaller cobble,  gravel and sand typical of mountain streams and,
given the dominant bedrock lithologies as described above, bespeak an
acidic milieu. The elevation here is a little over 3000 feet  (915 m). While most aspects here were essentially flat the valley opens to
the southwest at this point. The flood plain surface is quite rough,
with fragmented terraces and old channel scars.</p>

<ul>
<p>The most
spectacular view on this day was of the thousands of beautiful, deep
purple Wake Robin Trillium  (<i>Trillium  erectum </i>), which was
initially mistaken for the &quot;Nodding Trillium&quot;  (<i>Trillium
 cernuum</i>),  as a consequence of the form it showed on this
occasion. Also in bloom was Painted Trillium  (<i>Trillium  undulatum</i>), as well as Cut-leaf  Toothwort  (<i>Dentaria  laciniata</i>), 
Two-leaf Toothwort  (<i> D. diphylla</i>)  and an intimate
intergrowth of Canada Mayflower  (<i>Maianthemum  canadense</i>)  and
Dwarf Ginseng  (<i>Panax  trifolius</i>).  Also noted were Wood
Anemone  (<i>Anemone  quinquefolia</i>),  an unidentified anemone,
Foamflower  (<i>Tiarella</i>  <i>cordifolia</i>),  common White
Hellebore  (<i>Veratrum  viride</i>),  Partridge Berry  (<i>Mitchella
 repens</i>),  White Wood Sorrel  (<i>Oxalis  montana</i>) and the
shrubs Hobblebush  (<i>Viburnum  alnifolium </i>), Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis  virginiana</i>)  and Mountain Laurel  (<i>Kalmia 
latifolia</i>).  Wood Betony  (<i>Pedicularis  canadensis</i>),  also
in bloom, occurred on bare soil near the stream. Trees noted were
Yellow and black Birches  (<i>Betula  alleghaniensis</i> and <i>B</i>.
 <i>lenta</i>),  Sugar and Red maples  (<i>Acer  saccharum</i> and A<i>.
 rubrum </i>), American beech  (<i>Fagus  grandifolia</i>),  Canada
Hemlock  (<i>Tsuga</i>  <i>canadensis</i>),  White Ash  (<i>Fraxinus 
americana</i>)  and a few Northern Red Oak  (<i>Quercus  rubra</i>). </p>
<p>	It is of interest that
the beautifully-blooming Wake Robin Trillium occurred in its
greatest abundance along forest Road 14 in adjacent Five mile Hollow.</p>
<p>	Bird life, especially
in the treetops  (warblers ?),  appeared plentiful, Chipping Sparrows
 (<i>Spizella  passerina</i>)  foraged around our table and the first
Red-eyed Vireo  (<i>Vireo  olivaceus</i>)  ever was identified by
this observer!</p>
</ul>
<h2>Source Walk: 7-31-03</h2>
<ul>
<p><b>	</b>Our inventory
began at noon immediately up-valley from the camp ground under
cool, cloudy conditions, with a soil temperature determination  (T-695)  on an essentially flat aspect, on a terrace of the flood plain
under mature Sugar Maple and Canada Hemlock Obtained was a soil
temperature of T = 17.0 deg C. The associated air temperature was T=19.0 deg C. 
</p>
<p>	A soil sample  (#1) 
was taken at the same location as the soil temperature. An initial pH
of 4.3 was obtained, and after 24 hours this remained unchanged.</p>
<p>	A determination of the
pH of River water was also made, and this was found to be 4.7.</p>
<p>	We now began moving up
- valley on a dissected terrace several meters above the current
River water level. The canopy here was dominated by mature but young
Sugar Maple, Canada Hemlock somewhat infested by the Hemlock Woolly 
Adelgid  (<i>Adelges tsugae</i>),  abundant Yellow Birch, American
Beech, Red Maple and Black Cherry  (<i>Prunus  serotina</i>). 
Diameters averaged a foot or less. Also present were scattered mature
Black Birch,White Ash, Black Locust  (<i>Robinia  pseudoacacia</i>) 
and Northern Red Oak. Also as determined later, several mature Red
Spruce  (<i>Picea </i> <i>rubens </i>}of the order of 20 inches  (0.5
m)  dbh were found on the southwest side of the camp ground. Many of
the Beech, especially the smaller, showed evidence of the Beech Scale
- Nectria Complex  (<i>Cryptococcus fagisuga</i>).  Similarly, it
appeared to be the smaller Hemlock that were most affected by the
Adelgid.  (Whether through lack of experience in identification or
absence of affected trees, neither infestation had been apparent in
1993). No Red Spruce and little Hemlock reproduction were noted.
Additionally, such small Hemlock as were present appeared to be
significantly browsed by White-tailed Deer  (<i>Odocoileus 
virgininus</i>).  Scattered understory species were Muscletree (<i>Carpinus  caroliniana</i>)  and Striped Maple  (<i>Acer 
pensylvanicum</i>). </p>
<p>	Species progressively
noted as we moved up-valley, were White Wood Sorrel, Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium  filix-femina </i>), Curtis Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago 
curtisii</i>),  the sedge <i>Carex  laxiflora</i>, ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium  flabellifore</i>),  Calico Aster  (<i>Aster 
lateriflorus</i>),  White Ash seedlings, Great Chickweed  (<i>Stellaria
 pubera</i>),  Filmy Angelica  (<i>Angelica  triquinata</i>),  common

subvelutipes</i> and <i>Cantharellus </i> <i>cibarius</i>, Large
Round-leaved Orchid  (<i>Habenaria  orbiculata</i>)  and an
unidentified lily  (<i>Lilium</i>  sp ).  Next noted were Downy Many
Knees  (<i>Polygonatum  pubescens</i>),  a scale infected Beech,
Shining Clubmoss  (<i>Lycopodium  lucidulum</i>),  Carrion Flower (
<i>Smilax  herbacea</i>),  Sweet White Violet  (<i>Viola  blanda</i>) and the sedge <i>Carex  debilis</i>. Then on a White Ash the moss

<h2>Source Walk: 8-25-03</h2>
<ul>
<p>	Our inventory this day
was initiated at near noon by a soil temperature determination  (T-706)  at the same location as that of 7-31-03. A value of T= 16
deg C was obtained. Weather conditions were cool and pleasant.</p>
<p>	An inventory was then
conducted of a small abandoned channel wetland which formed an
opening. Noted were Virginia knotweed  (<i>Polygonum  virginianum</i>) in fruit, Turtlehead, Spotted Jewelweed  (<i>Impatiens  capensis</i>) and Crooked-stem Aster, both in bloom, Revolute Meadowrue (
<i>Thalictrum  revolutum</i>),  Purple-stem Aster  (<i>Aster

tongue Grass, Common Horsetail  (<i>Equisetum  arvense</i>)  and
Larger Water Starwort  (<i>Callitriche </i> <i>heterophylla </i>).</p>
<p>	Additional upland
species seen were Downy Rattlesnake Plantain  (<i>Goodyera  pubescens
</i>) and Filmy Angelica in seed.</p>
<p>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<p>	It is  informative to
compare the flora here with our inventoried areas of <a href=teacreek.htm>Tea Creek</a> and
the <a href=laurelsouth.htm>Laurel Fork Wilderness</a> Areas  (see our sections on these areas). 
These areas are also valley flats in part, but have access to a
greater source of nutrients, either from underlying rocks  (Tea Creek
), or from up-stream   (Laurel Fork Wilderness Areas).  Both of
these areas, like the East Fork of the Greenbrier, are rich in
northern species, but appear to have far richer floras in general.
This is particularly true of  Tea Creek, where such demanding trees
as Yellow Buckeye  (<i>Aesculus  octandra</i>)  and American Basswood
 (<i>Tilia  americana</i>)  are common and even the warm climate
Tuliptree  (<i>Liriodendron  tulipifera</i>)  occurs in small
numbers. These trees are accompanied by such rich-soil indicators
as Black Elderberry  (<i>Sambucus  canadensis</i>),  Black Raspberry
(<i>Rubus  occidentalis </i>), Mountain Bugbane  (<i>Cimicifuga 
americana</i>), Fraser's Sedge  (<i>Cymophyllus  fraseri</i>)  and
the mint <i>Meehania  cordata</i>. While the upland forests in the
Laurel Fork Wilderness occur on Hampshire Formation bedrock, much as
those of the East Fork of the Greenbrier, and as a consequence are
relatively depauperate, the vegetation of the flood plain is rich and
varied as a consequence of Greenbrier limestone in the upper
watershed.</p>
<p>	An additional factor
that should be considered is the unprecedented wet period that
preceded our inventories. These conditions may be reflected in soil
and water acidities and temperatures, and in the abundance and
character of fungi and pathogens. Gillies <i>et al</i>  (1998)  did
an extensive study of the chemistry and water quality of the
Greenbrier River. They found uniformly high values of pH and
alkalinity, and none of their pH values fell below 7. However only
two of their sample stations were located in the reach of our study.
Nonetheless, the difference in pH between the data of Gillies et al (1998) and of this study seems too great to attribute to differences
in meteorological conditions and can only be resolved by further
studies.</p>
