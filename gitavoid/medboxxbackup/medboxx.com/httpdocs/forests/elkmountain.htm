<p> The
Elk Mountain/Gay Knob Area forms the southeast edge of the Allegheny Plateau
and overlooks the Greenbrier Valley northwest of Marlinton, West Virginia. Attention here is directed to the more
limited area lying between US Route 219 and the base of Gay Knob, specifically
along Forest Road 202 of the Monongahela National Forest. Exposed rocks in this area, which lies between
3500 and 3900 ft (1070 and 1190 meters) elevation are part of the Bluefield
Formation. Compositionally, this
formation consists of "Red and green shale and sandstone with a few thin
limestone beds" (Cardwell <i>et al</i>, 1968). Most of the area is rolling upland, with a few pronounced knobs
rising higher. Gay Knob rises to 4545
ft (1385 meters) and is composed dominantly of Hinton Formation which is
compositionally similar to the Bluefield. 
Aspect along most of the traverse, which extended somewhat over a mile
along FR 202, is south, with the slope falling away to the Greenbrier
Valley. From road cuts, where past
erosion has not been too severe, soils appear deep, with the characteristically
poorly-defined horizons and dark color of the mull type. Despite the high elevations the character of
these soils and exposure to the sun and valley wind currents have resulted in a
mesic forest quite different from those most typical of the high
Alleghenies. This forest is also rather
young, perhaps no more than 50 years in age, but its trees are tall and of good
form, reflecting high site quality.
<p> Near the road junction at the lowest elevations, the
canopy consists of Sugar Maple (<i>Acer</i> 
<i>saccharum</i>), Beech (<i>Fagus 
grandifolia</i>), Shagbark Hickory (<i>Carya ovata</i>), Northern Red Oak (Q<i>uercus rubra</i>), White Oak (<i>Q. alba</i>), Black Locust (<i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>), Red Maple <i> (Acer</i> r<i>ubrum</i>), Black Birch (<i>Betula lenta</i>), White Ash (F<i>raxinus americana</i>), Black Cherry (<i>Prunus</i> <i>serotina</i>) and Cucumber Magnolia (<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>) roughly in order of
abundance. Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus</i> sp) of undetermined species and abundant Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya 
virginiana</i>) dominate the understory. A cursory examination of the herbs along the road and at the
forest edge revealed very abundant Tall Bellflower (<i>Campanula americana</i>) and
Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>), less abundant but still
common Horse-balm (<i>Collinsonia canadensis</i>), Starry Campion (<i>Silene 
stellata</i>), Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i>), Mad-dog Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria 
lateriflora</i>), Wild Stonecrop (<i>Sedum ternatum</i>), Panicled Hawkweed (<i>Hieracium 
paniculatum</i>), Horse Gentian (<i>Triosteum</i> sp.), Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago 
rugosa</i>) and American Spikenard (<i>Aralia racemosa</i>). However many other herbs were likely present but unidentified
because of the season and limited time of observation.
<p> Perhaps a quarter of a mile (400 meters) from the
road junction, at an elevation of about 3600 ft (1100 meters), a spot inventory
was conducted in the adjacent forest interior. 
The canopy here consists of Sugar Maple, Beech, Black Cherry, White Ash
and Black Birch with large woody debris of American Chestnut (<i>Castanea 
dentata</i>) . The understory is
dominated by Hophornbeam up to ten inches (25 cm) dbh, with smaller amounts of
Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum
</i>) and Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i>) . These species hold for at least one half acre (0.2 hectare) over
which a quite exhaustive inventory of ground cover was also done. This was dominated by Sugar Maple seedlings
with a few Bitternut Hickory (<i>Carya 
cordiformis</i>) as well. 
Associated herbs were Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>), 
Wild Stonecrop, Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago 
curtisii</i>), Blue Cohosh, Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>), 
Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium
triflorum</i> ), Lance-leaf Wild
Liquorice (<i>G. lanecolatum ) </i>, Wood
Nettle, Tall Bellflower (in bloom as in the open), Indian Turnip (<i>Arisæma 
triphyllum</i>), Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>), Gall-of-the-Earth (<i>Prenanthes</i> sp.), Round-leaf Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia</i>), Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>
Aralia nudicaulis</i>) Crooked-stem
Aster (<i>Aster prenanthoides</i>), Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia 
sessilifolia</i>), the sedges <i>Carex radiata</i> 
and <i>C. gracilescens </i>and
Beechdrops (<i>Epifagus virginiana</i>), the root parasite of
Beech. This spot was also
extraordinarily rich in ferns, with the following species observed: Southern Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium filix -femina</i>), 
Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides </i>), New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris noveboracenis</i>), Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>), Intermediate
Shield Fern (<i>D. intermedia</i>), 
Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda claytoniana</i>) and Broad Beech Fern (<i>Phegopteris hexagonoptera</i>) . Present here also was a very lively Wood
Frog (<i>Rana sylvatica</i>) 
<p> Despite the high elevation, species of wide
distribution dominate, with only the presence of Canada Mayflower and Wild
Sarsaparilla and the absence of certain southern species such as Tuliptree (<i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i>) are indicative of these
elevations.
<p> The close association here of Canada Mayflower, which
normally reflects acid conditions, and species which usually occur under more
alkaline conditions, raises an interesting question. Since Canada Mayflower is a boreal species that is apparently
favored by both cool and acid environments, it should, by LeChâtelier’s
Theorem, be able to grow under more alkaline conditions at the lower
temperatures associated with high elevations. 
However, extensive studies would be 
required to confirm this.
<p> The forest along the entire traverse of more than a
mile (1.6 km) to the base of Gay Knob is of a similar character to that near
the road, although there is a 400 ft (120 meter) increase in elevation. Additional canopy species noted, but which
could have been present at the start, were American Basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>) and Butternut (<i>Juglans 
cinerea</i>) . Also a few
isolated leaves of White Basswood (<i>T. 
heterophylla</i>) that had fallen to the road were seen near the end of
the traverse. However the tree from
which they were blown was not seen. 
Additional species of shrubs and herbs tallied were Black
Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>), 
Flowering Raspberry (<i>Rubus 
odoratus</i>), Basil Balm (<i>Monarda
clinopodia</i>), Spotted Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens capensis</i>), Poke (<i>Phytolacca americana</i>), 
Virgin’s Bower (<i>Clematis virginiana</i>), Enchanters Nightshade (<i>Circæa 
quadrisulcata</i>), Bottle-brush Grass (<i>Hystrix patula</i>) and Canada
Bromegrass (<i>Bromus purgans</i>) . Many of the herbs noted at the start, such as Tall Bellflower,
also maintained their abundance to the end of the traverse. Virtually all of both woody and herbaceous
species observed, if not limited to, at
least characterize mesic and even circumneutral conditions. This is in all likelihood a result of a
carbonate component in the rock and soil.
<p> While not abundant, and at this season largely
silent, birds observed or heard were Eastern Phoebe (<i>Sayornis phoebe</i>), Scarlet
Tanager (<i>Piranga</i> <i>olivacea</i>) and Raven (<i>Corvus corax</i>) . Fritillary Butterflies and other unidentified lepidoptera were
also common.
<p> Gay
Knob is somewhat unusual because, although it rises to 4545 ft (1385 meters)
elevation, it appears covered by deciduous forest to the summit, at least on
the southwest side, while mountains only a little higher to the west (see
photos) are topped by spruce. Like the
forest along FR 202, deciduous species on this knob are probably favored by
both rock types, which may include substantial carbonate, and position at the
plateau edge where there is maximum exposure to warm, moisture-bearing winds
that sweep up the Greenbrier Valley. In
any case, the entire area seems little subject to cold air
drainage/accumulation since slopes are generally directed toward the Greenbrier
Valley or north toward Pleasant Valley. 
Thus cooling would be confined to the effect of lapse rate. This provides an interesting contrast with
the Tea Creek area and the Gaudineer Scenic Area, Although developed on
similar bedrock, the former lies about 700 feet (214 meters) lower on average,
but is subject to cold air drainage/accumulation because it is in a deep river
basin not accessible to south winds.The latter lies only a little higher, but
has an acidic substrate of siliceous rock at least in part, and lies above a
higher and more constricted part of the Greenbrier Valley. This results in both cases in mixed forest with a
Red Spruce component as well as more boreal undergrowth and herb floras (see
our sections on <a href=teacreek.htm>Tea Creek</a> and the <a href=gaud.htm>Gaudineer Scenic Area</a>).
