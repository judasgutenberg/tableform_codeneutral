<p><b>Pocahontas County, West Virginia</b><br>
<b>January, 2001</b>
<p> 

<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
The Hills Creek Scenic Area is the site of three scenic waterfalls and the gorge on
Hills Creek. Within the Scenic Area the dominant bedrock is the Mississippian
Hinton Formation, which has a diverse lithology, including thin beds of
limestone, although no sign of the latter rock type was observed by us here.
Overlying the Hinton on the adjacent mountain slopes is the Bluestone
Formation, also of Mississippian age and of complex lithology. Finally, capping
the mountain ridges is the Pennsylvanian New River Formation, a member of the
Pottsville Group and dominated by erosion resistant sand- stones  (Cardwell <i>et
al</i>, 1968).  The area falls in the Allegheny Plateau physiographic province
and virtually all rock bedding has a near horizontal attitude. Of interest are
the abundant large blocks of conglomeratic sandstone which lie scattered about
in the Scenic Area near the Creek, and presumably were derived from the
Pottsville as erosional remnants, or
which were transported from adjacent mountain ridges in rock falls or slides.
Because the upper Hills Creek watershed is dominated by siliceous rock - shale,
siltstone and sandstone – its waters are largely acidic in character, and this
seems to hold quite generally also for soils in the area.

<b>Source Walks: 8-16-00 and 8-17-00</b>
<p>
<ul>Our first traverse, beginning in early afternoon, was under bright, cool conditions
with some clouds, and extended down slope from the Scenic Area parking lot to
the upper falls. The forest here, at an elevation of near 3400 feet  (1037 m), 
was uneven-aged with a canopy of some quite large, and possibly old growth,
Beech, Yellow Birch, Sugar an Red Maples, Red Spruce, Black Cherry, Canada
Hemlock and a few each of Basswood, Cucumbertree (<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>),  Fraser Magnolia (<i>M. fraseri</i>) and White Ash. The most
conspicuous understory tree was Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>),  but Mountain Maple (<i>A. spicatum</i>) was common as well. The most
common shrub appeared to be Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>),  but Hobblebush (<i>Viburnum alnifolium</i>),  Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>), Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana</i>) and Witch Hazel (<i>
Hamamelis virginiana</i>) also
occurred.
<p> Noted in
succession as we descended the slope to the stream were Black Elderberry,
Striped Maple, a 20 inch  (O.5 m)  dbh, healthy appearing Beech, Intermediate
Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>), 
which was the dominant ground cover, Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola blanda</i>),  Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii</i>),  Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>),  Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>),  the fungus <i>Amanita ceciliae</i>, Shining Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium lucidulum</i>),  Yellow Clintonia (<i>Clintonia borealis</i>),  White Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis montana</i>),  Oyster Mushroom (<i>Pleurotis ostreatus</i>),  Hobblebush, the poison
puffball <i>Scleroderma citrinum</i>,
a fungus of the <i>Russula emetica</i>
complex, Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum</i> <i>canadense</i>),  an unidentified Trillium
(<i>Trillium </i> sp),  Indian
Cucumberroot (<i>Medeola virginiana
</i>), seedlings of Sugar Maple, saplings of Red Spruce, the fungi<i>
Boletus luridus </i> and <i>Xerula furfuracea</i>, the moisture-loving and acidiphile sedge <i>Carex intumescens,</i> seedlings of Fraser
Magnolia, Painted Trillium (<i>Trillium 
undulatum</i>),  Red Maple, the fungi<i>Collybia confluens</i> and an unidentified <i>Clitocybe</i>;
then scattered large blocks of conglomeratic sandstone, followed by
unidentified species of<i>Hypnum</i> and other mosses on down boles and seedlings of Striped and Sugar Maple.
<p> Here a soil
sample  (no 1)  was taken from a 2-3 inch (5-8 cm) depth under a Spruce
sapling with associated Canada Mayflower. This soil was quite rich in both
organic matter and red clay. A value of 4.4 was obtained for the pH of this
sample both initially and 19 hours later.
<p> Continuing,
we recorded a 34 inch  (0.76 m)  dbh Beech, a 44 inch (1.1 m) dbh Yellow Birch, Partridge Berry (<i>
Mitchella repens</i>),  the fungi <i>Ganoderma applanatum</i>, the root parasite<i>
Armillariella mellea </i> (Honey
Mushroom),  <i>Collybia dryophylla</i>
and an unidentified <i>Tyromyces</i>. Here we became aware of the generally
heavy leaf mat, which was present despite the prominence of Yellow Birch and
the maples, the leaves of which usually decay rapidly. This may be an
indication of relatively low forest floor temperatures. Also noted was the
fungus<i>Fomes fomentarius</i> on dead
Beech and the relatively few seedlings of this tree. Next seen were a large
Black Cherry and the fungi<i>Amanita 
farinosa </i>,  the edible <i>Tricholomopsis platyphylla</i>  (&quot;Platterfull&quot;),
<i>Boletus affinus </i>var <i> maculosus</i>, also edible, and characteristic of Beech woods, the
deadly poisonous<i>Paxillus involutus</i>,
an unidentified <i>Entoloma</i> and <i>Phylloporus rhodoxanthus</i>  (the edible but unusual Gilled Bolete).  These
were followed by seedlings of Mountain Holly,  Thornless Blackberry (<i>Rubus canadensis</i>) and Alternate-leaved
Dogwood (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i>). 
<p> We had now
reached the upper falls on Hills Creek and observed the almost horizontal and
rather thin beds of the Hinton Formation. Also apparent along the stream was
the relative concentration of Great Rhododendron. Then, following the trail
toward the second falls, we noted Honewort (<i>Cryptotaenia canadensis</i>),  which may have owed its
presence to limestone gravel in the path, also abundant Mountain Maple and on
the adjacent bank, a single plant of Southern Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium
 erythrocarpum</i>).  Here we
began a descent on a wooden staircase bordered by a steep colluvial slope
immediately to the right. Successively observed on this slope, the top of which
bore a heavy growth of Great Rhododendron, were Dutchman's pipe vine (<i>Aristolochia macrophylla</i>),  Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>),  blooming White Snakeroot
 (<i>Eupatorium rugosum</i>),  Pale Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens pallida</i>) and Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea arborescens</i>),  both in bloom, Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>) and an
unidentified species of <i>Atrichum</i> moss.
<p> A soil
sample  (no 2)  was now taken from the bank in reddish, quite plastic clay with
little visible organic matter. This sample had a pH value of 4.5 both initially
and 19 hours later.
<p> Continuing
our descent, we saw Sugar Maple, Black Elderberry, abundant great Rhododendron
on the distant upper slope, Virginia Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum</i>) on the lower slope with
Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium</i> 
<i>purpureum</i>),  Black Cohosh 
(<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>) 
with flowers just budding, Millet Grass (<i>Milium effusum</i>),  more Mountain Maple and White Snakeroot; then
large and abundant blooming Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>).  A small seep contained Lettuce Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga micranthidifolia</i>),  while a moist rock
bore the thallus liverwort <i>Conocephalum 
conicum</i>, and an adjacent area, Spotted Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens capensis</i>). 
<p> Descending
farther, we saw Drooping Wood Reed Grass (<i>Cinna latifolia</i>),  <i>Carex 
scabrata,</i> Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>),  American Basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>),  Foam Flower (<i>
Tiarella cordifolia</i>),  Wood Anemone
(<i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>), 
Silvery Glade Fern (<i>Athyrium 
thelypterioides</i>),  <i>Carex 
plantaginea</i>, Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria pubera</i>),  Autumn Bent grass (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>) ; then more Virginia
waterleaf, Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum 
thalictroides</i>) in fruit, a species of <i>Lepiota</i> fungus and
Broadleaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago 
flexicaulis</i>). 
<p> Here
another soil sample  (no 3)  was taken from the steep colluvial slope in close
proximity to <i>Carex plantaginea</i>,
Blue Cohosh and Sugar Maple. This sample had a pH of 5.6 both initially and 19
hours later.
<p> The wooden
staircase had now delivered us to the stream flat at the slope base. Here we
found Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum 
lanuginosum</i>) with ripe fruit, Canada Violet  (<i>Viola 
canadensis</i>),  a single tiny seedling of Bitternut Hickory (<i>Carya cordiformis</i>), New York Fern  (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis</i>),  the fungus<i>Dadaleopsis confragosa,</i> abundant seedlings of Sugar
Maple and the fungus<i>Lactarius 
lignyotus</i>, a species usually found in &quot;spruce and sphagnum
bogs&quot;  (Phillips, 1991).  Elsewhere Great Rhododendron covered the flat
which borders the rocky stream bed. Here,  among the rocks, in the open, grew
Tall Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum 
pubescens</i>),  Filmy Angelica 
(<i>Angelica triquinata</i>), 
blooming White Wood Aster (<i>Aster 
divaricatus</i>) and luxuriant 
Hispid Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus 
hispidus</i>). 
<p> Continuing
down the trail, we saw abundant Sugar Maple, coexisting Spotted and Pale
Jewelweeds, Blue Monkshood  (<i>Aconitum uncinatum</i>),  the manna grass <i>Glyceria
 melicaria</i> in a seep, an
unidentified species of the fungus <i>Gymnopilus</i>, Oswego Tea (<i>Monarda didyma</i>) in bloom and, on an elevated
bank, Roundleaf Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia</i>).
<p> We now
reached a steep cliff, which we descended on a steel staircase. Growing on
ledges and in cracks in this cliff were Alpine Enchanter's Nightshade (<i>Circaea alpina</i>),  Clearweed (<i>Pilea pumila</i>),  Brittle Fern (<i>Cystopteris fragilis</i>),  a large Poke (<i>Phytolacca americana</i>) plant, Maidenhair Spleenwort
(<i>Asplenium trichomanes</i>),  the
alien cress <i>Cardamine impatiens</i>,
Pale Jewelweed and a little Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum acerifolium</i>).  On descending farther we
reached a ledge with a view of the third falls, which at 63 feet  (19 m),  is the second highest in the State.
Also seen here were Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa 
uniflora</i>) and a Ruby-throated Hummingbird (<i>Archilochus colubris</i>).  During our return by the
same path we added to our tally Witch Hazel, the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i> and the attractive fungus <i>Naematoloma sublateritium</i> (syn <i>Hypholoma sublateritium</i>).
<p> A water
sample taken from the Creek had pH=5.3, in keeping with the generally acid
terrain.
<p> <b>Additional
species collected on the traverse and identified later were the following:</b>
<p> Smooth
Rockcress (<i>Arabis laevigata</i>) 
<br> A sedge <i>Carex
appalachica</i>
<br> Plume Lily
(<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>) 
<br> A fungus <i>Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus </i>
 
 
<p> <b>The
following are mosses collected and identified by R. Hunsucker from the hills
Creek gorge. All occurred on moist soil or rock </b>
<p><i>Tortula ammonsiana </i> (&quot;new to me&quot;-
recorded from Sevier Co., Tenn. and South Africa as well; for more information
on this species see Crum and Anderson, i981).
<br><i>Plagiothecium 
cavifolium</i>
<br><i>P. denticulatum</i>
<br><i>Bryhnia graminicolor</i>
<br><i>Mnium punctatum </i> var <i>punctatum</i>
<br><i>M. hornum</i>
<br><i>Anomodon attenuatus</i>
<br><i>Bartramia pomiformis </i>(Apple Moss)
<br><i>Philonotus</i> sp (strile)
<br><i>Bryum </i> sp (strile)
 
<p>Fauna observed in the vicinity of
camp included the birds Hermit Thrush (<i>Catharus guttatus</i>),  Wood Thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustelina</i>),  Black-capped Chickadee (<i>Parus atricapillus</i>) and Chimney Swift (<i>Chaetura pelagica</i>) and the butterflies
Red-spotted Purple (<i>Limenitis 
arthemis astyanax</i>) and Pipe
Vine Swallowtail (<i>Papilio philenor</i>). 
<p> A water
sample from a brook that flows near the parking lot had a pH of 5.9.
<p>&nbsp;
<p> Our morning
of 8-17-00 began with the sounds and/or appearances of Hermit and Wood
Thrushes, Black-throated Blue Warbler (<i>Dendroica caerulescens</i>),  Cedar Waxwing (<i>Bombycilla cedrorum</i>),  Red-eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>) and Red Squirrel (<i>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</i>). 
<p> Beginning
in the early morning, a traverse was made up the eastern shoulder of Point
Mountain along the Fork Mountain Trail, which followed an old logging road. The
following species and terrain features were successively noted: Initially the
trail passed through mature but young acid/mesic forest similar to that described on our previous traverse. Large
blocks of conglomeratic sandstone were conspicuous and Basswood, Sugar Maple,
Beech and White Ash were canopy species. Seedlings of Sugar and Striped Maples
were common, as were Shining Clubmoss, Intermediate Shield Fern and White Wood
Sorrel. Accompanying these were the fungi <i>Amanita flavoconia</i>, <i>A</i>. 
<i>fulva, Russula emetica</i> complex, <i>Amanita rubescens</i>, and on hemlock, <i>Ramaria stricta. </i>Other associates were Yellow
Clintonia, Canada Mayflower, Red Spruce and saplings of the same.




<p> Now
climbing, Beech assumed greater abundance and we noted<i>Medeola,</i> Honey
Mushroom, Great Rhododendron, Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium virginianum</i>) on conglomreatic sandstone,
Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium 
flabelliforme</i>) and large black Cherry.
<p> We now
reached what appeared to be an old logging cut, perhaps 30 years in age, in
which abundant Yellow Birch had seeded themselves. Associated were a few Red
Maple, Cucumbertree and smaller Fraser Magnolia. Beginning here we also began
to see large Fire Cherry (<i>Prunus 
pensylvanica</i>),  some of which exceeded a foot  (0.3 m)  dbh. Seen here also was black, large
(large bore!) Black Bear (<i>Ursus 
americanus</i>) scat, rich in plant fibers.
<p> Continuing,
we observed Partridge Berry, Black Cherry, more Yellow Birch, larger Sugar
Maple, Hispid Greenbrier (Smilax 
hispida) ; then very abundant seedlings and small saplings of Sugar
Maple Although in quite open forest, scattered red spruce saplings concentrated
in the old logging road we were following.
<p> Next
encountered were a few small Black Birch  (the first seen in the area)  and
still abundant Sugar Maple. Here also we heard a White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>Sitta carolinensis</i>),  noted a few patches of
an unidentified <i>Polytrichum</i> moss, abundant and lush Shining Clubmoss,
White Wood Sorrel, the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, Beech and Beech Drops (<i>Epifagus virginiana</i>) and an 8 inch  (0.2 m)  dbh
Fire Cherry, as well as some equally large dead trees of this species.
<p> We now came
upon an isolated 27 inch  (0.69 m)  dbh
well formed White Ash encrusted with the moss <i>Neckera pennata</i>. A soil sample  (no 4) was
taken from a depth of 2-3 inches beneath this large tree near the trunk. This soil
was rich in organic matter but appeared to be a semi-mor in that this organic
matter appeared to be concentrated on top and seemed somewhat raw. Associated
plants were Sugar and Striped Maple saplings, Intermediate Shield Fern, Beech,
a violet (<i>Viola</i> sp)  and the
moss <i>Thuidium</i> <i>delictulum</i>.
The value of pH obtained for this sample was 4.4 both initially and 19 hours
later. If correct, this value of the pH falls within but near the low limit
tentatively inferred for the stability field of this tree  (Mueller, 1998). 
Also indicating a possible slight increase in soil fertility here was the
occurrence of several large multi-stemmed 
basswood a little farther along the trail. The call of a Hermit Thrush
was also heard here.
<p> The forest
canopy now became one of essentially Yellow Birch and Sugar Maple, with Red
Spruce saplings confined to the trail side. Also present were scattered large
Black Cherry, Hairy Disporum in fruit.
The soil and subsoil here appeared to be deep with fragments of siltstone and
sandstone. Violets were abundant ground
cover, but no <i>Oxalis</i> was seen. Sugar Maple seedlings appeared to have
increased in abundance.
<p> We here
encountered a 20 inch  (0.5 m)  dbh Northern Red Oak, and the only oak seen on
our visit, while the adjacent trail bank bore a single plant of Saw Brier (<i>
Smilax glauca</i>), also the
only example of this species seen by us. These were followed by a little Red
Maple, Witch Hazel, with seedlings of the same and New York Fern. 
<p> A soil
sample (no 5) was now taken in close proximity to Hispid Greenbrier with
nearby Carrion Flower  (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>) and Sugar Maple seedlings on
a bank composed of seemingly rich soil. This soil was rich in organic matter,
which appeared more incorporated with mineral matter and more decomposed than
that of sample no 4. Anomalous pH values ranging from 4.5 to 6.0 were obtained
initially but these dropped to 4.6 nineteen hours later.
<p> Farther on
we encountered more Basswood and then, at the trail side, abundant Mountain
Bindweed (<i>Polygonum cilinode</i>), 
while the forest, dominated by Yellow Birch and Sugar Maple, had virtually no
leaf mat. Here again there was a little Black Birch as well.
<p> As we
continued to climb, Sugar Maple assumed greater dominance, although Yellow
Birch was still common, and there was a punctuation by large Black Cherry. Here
we also saw a large Dutchman's Pipe vine ascending a Sugar Maple. Next,
crossing a springbrook, there was <i>Carex 
scabrata</i>, Oswego tea,
abundant Lettuce Saxifrage, rather stunted Wood Nettle and a little Black
Cohosh. The rock here, while apparently mostly siltstone, included a black,
non-fissile shale. Beech still remained a common subordinate tree, and a few
Spruce saplings continued to line the trail.
<p> Next seen
were Plume Lily, <i>Carex intumescens</i>,
Lady Fern, a White-breasted Nuthatch, Ground Pine,Shining Clubmoss on a mound
and the fungus <i>Lactarius</i> <i>atroviridis</i>.
The canopy was now essentially one of Sugar Maple with some Beech. In the trail
opening the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum 
erectum</i> was common and accompanied by Black Elderberry, a few Ramps
(<i>Allium tricoccum</i>) in seed,
Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca </i> obtusa), Filmy Angelica and the first Christmas Fern of the traverse. Signs of Deer
browsing was common on a variety of different plants.
<p> The soil
here appeared to darken somewhat and observed plants included an unidentified
Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza </i> sp), 
Millet Grass and Fowl Manna Grass (<i>Glyceria striata</i>) in a seep. Following these we saw a one foot (
0.3 m)  dbh Fire Cherry, Autumn Bent grass, <i>Medeola</i>, Curtis Goldenrod
and, in another seep, Golden Saxifrage (<i>Chrysosplenium americanum</i>) and Pennsylvania
Bittercress (<i>Cardamine</i> <i> pensylvanica</i>) ; then more Basswood, Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio 
aureus</i>),  continued abundant Sugar Maple and the most abundant
seedlings of this species seen thus far in these mountains.
<p> Moving
onward, we encountered the fungus <i>Ramaria 
stricta</i> and another large Dutchman's Pipe vine. Then, in the trail,
we became aware of patches, several square meters in area, where the leaves and
upper soil had been scraped away, as if by a foraging animal. Exposed in these
patches were bulblets, white and pink respectively, of Dutchman's Breeches (<i>Dicentra cucullaria</i>) and Squirrel Corn (<i>D. canadensis</i>),  as well as the rhizomes of
Two-leaved Toothwort (<i> Dentaria diphylla</i>).  These scratches were
probably attributable to Deer, since they are known to favor <i>Dicentra </i>as
food. Also heard here was the short call of the Veery (<i>Catharus fuscescens</i>). 
<p> Now, on the
slope above the trail, there was a massive linear outcrop of sandstone of the
order of several meters in thickness. This was a fine grained rock, quite
unlike the erratic conglomeratic sand stone blocks or boulders seen on the
valley bottom. Identified here were Mountain Wood Fern (<i>Dryopteris campyloptera) </i>, the parasitic dodder <i>Cuscuta gronovii </i>on Mountain Bindweed,
Carex radiata, C. de<i>bilis</i> and, on
a slight elevation, a single blooming plant of Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>). 
<p> A soil
sample  (no 6)  was taken from the trail bank; this had well incorporated organic matter, and proved to be a silt loam from its lack of
coherence when dry. Values of pH obtained were 4.6 initially and 4.5 nineteen
hours later.
<p> No
lepidoptera except a few small moths were seen on this traverse.

<p>
<p> As evening
thunder sounded to the northwest - the prelude to heavy showers as night fell -
a few additional observations were made around camp and along the trail to the
upper falls. These included the abundance of <i>Solidago rugosa </i>along the road, bands of juncos (
<i>Junco hyemalis</i>), likely family
groups, in low shrubbery, Speckled Alder (<i>Alnus rugosa</i>) along the Creek and the generally healthy appearance
of Beech, indicating apparent low incidence of the Scale - <i>Nectria </i>complex.
Also noted was the apparent smaller sizes and less sharply angular forms of the
conglomeratic sandstone blocks as compared to those at the Gaudineer Scenic
Area (see <A href=gaud.htm>our section on this area</a>). It seems likely that this difference is
a consequence of the greater distance that those at Hills Creek had been
transported.
 
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<p> 
<p>Although soils in the area are
prevailingly acid and the forest types acid/mesic in character, a considerable
diversity of habitats is present, particularly in the vicinity of the stream.
As in many locations in the Allegheny Highlands, there is a relatively small
number of tree species. Additionally, although the herb layer is quite diverse,
many herbs and vines characteristic of the Central Appalachians as a whole are
missing. Particularly conspicuous by their absence are virtually all vines such
as the grapes (<i>Vitis </i>spp),  Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia </i>),  Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus 
radicans</i>) and low frequencies of the greenbriers (<i>Smilax</i> spp).  It is likely that these absences and
low numbers are a direct consequence of relatively low temperatures and late
frosts in the early growing season, and this results in a climate similar to
that of northern New England or adjacent Canada.
