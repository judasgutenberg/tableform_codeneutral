 <ul>
<p>Among the few remnants of mesic
	primary forest in the Central Appalachians, the Fanny Bennett tract
	is a standout in its beauty and diversity.  Although only 65 acres
	(26 ha.) in area, it embraces two stream bottoms, slopes of both
	northeast and southwest aspect and a ridge top.  Technically a part
	of the Valley and Ridge Province, it is located in an area of
	transition with many of the characteristics of the Allegheny
	Mountains and Plateau.  Elevations range from a little less than
	3000 ft. (910 meters) to about 3250 ft. (990 meters) asl on a slope
	which rises continuously to Spruce Knob, the highest point in West
	Virginia.  Bedrock underlying the grove is Mississippian Pocono
	Group sandstone and shale, but the Greenbrier Limestone lies just
	upslope and exerts its influence through the drainage system (
	Cardwell et al, 1968) 
<p>The most convenient approach to the
	Grove is via the Sawmill Branch Road from Route 28.  This road
	follows the picturesque gorge of Sawmill Branch upstream through a
	secondary but rich and diverse mesic forest.  This forest is mixed
	mesophyte with Tuliptree  (<i>Liriodendron  tulipifera </i>) at its
	lower elevations of about 2500 ft (760 meters), but northern
	hardwood at the Fanny Bennett Grove, where no Tuliptree was seen.  A
	west-trending prong of Sawmill Branch passes through the center of
	the Grove while the mainstem of this stream crosses its southeast
	edge.
<p>The 1993 and 1994 visits were brief
	and generally occupied by introductory observations, while that of
	1996 concentrated on the flora. A further visit in 2003 was largely
	for the purpose of studying its bryophytes. Consequently, few
	observations of fauna were made. However the common calls of Scarlet
	Tanagers  (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>)  were noted in the June 1994
	visit.  Also on the 5-19-93 visit many tiny crayfish were seen in
	the stream within the grove.  Since August is a quiet time for
	birds, few complicated our botanizing.  Although we examined the
	stream in a cursory way for aquatic life, little was in evidence at
	that time.  This may have been a consequence of heavy scour
	experienced by these streams during then-recent floods.
<p>The 8-10-96 traverses through the
	Grove were more systematic than the previous visits.  The first
	extended a little way along the established entrance trail leading
	into the interior on the northeast side of the stream.  It then
	crossed the west prong stream bottom to the slope on the southwest,
	ascended this slope to a terminating bench and curved downward to
	the floodplain of the mainstem Sawmill Branch.  Total length of this
	traverse was perhaps a half mile (0.8 km).  The second traverse
	ascended the opposite slope to the northeast to the ridge crest,
	extended along this crest to the northwest, descended to the west
	prong and returned to the entrance trail.  This traverse was perhaps
	a little longer than the first.
<p>The initial impression on entering
	the grove is of a forest dominated by very mature if not old growth
	Hemlock  (<i>Tsuga  canadensis</i>).   While the Hemlock are
	impressively tall, their girths do not compare with some old growth
	specimens in other locales, as in Cathedral State Park for example. 
	Generally they do not much exceed 3 feet (0.9 meters) dbh.  Along
	the interior stream bottom the Hemlocks share dominance with Beech (
	<i>Fagus </i> <i>grandifolia </i>), Sugar and Red Maples  (<i>Acer 
	saccharum</i> and <i>S.  rubrum </i>), Yellow and Black Birches (
	<i>Betula </i> <i>alleghaniensis </i>and <i>B. lenta</i>),  White
	and Northern Red Oaks  (<i>Quercus  alba</i> and <i>Q.  rubra</i>), 
	White Ash  (<i>Fraxinus  americana</i>),  American Basswood  (<i>Tilia
	 americana</i>)  and Black Cherry  (<i>Prunus  serotina</i>).   A
	striking feature is the abundance of large dead snags, dead falls
	and large woody debris.  Debris dams are common in the stream, which
	flows over a rocky bed of layered sandstone.  While  the understory
	and shrub layer are sparse along the stream bottom, there is some
	Striped Maple  (<i>Acer </i> <i>pensylvanicum</i>),  Alternate-leaf
	Dogwood  (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i>)  and Hobblebush (<i>Viburnum
	alnifolium  </i>).  A few Mountain Ash (<i>Pyrus americana  </i>)
	seedlings were also noted.  While Hemlock dominates in this bottom,
	there are few seedlings or saplings of the species and the same is
	also true of Red Spruce  (<i>Picea  rubens</i>),  which occurs
	elsewhere in the Grove.  As in other old growth Hemlock forests,
	there is an aura here of cool serenity without gloom and a pervasive
	odor of mouldering wood and fungi that is the essence of the slow
	uninterrupted slide toward equilibrium between the organic and
	mineral worlds.
<p>The slope to the southwest of the
	stream, where a northeast aspect prevails, is decidedly mesic and
	perhaps less acidic than the interior stream bottom.  Here are some
	very large Sugar Maple and tree fall gaps where other old giants
	have been toppled, perhaps aided by unstable soils on the steep
	slope.  These gaps contain abundant saplings of Sugar, Red and
	Striped Maple, Black Birch and a few Cucumber Magnolia  (<i>Magnolia
	 acuminata </i>) and many of these saplings show evidence of
	continued soil creep in the form of curved and contorted trunks.  On
	the bench which tops this mesic slope the old growth ends and is
	replaced by mature but secondary stands consisting largely of
	Northern Red  and White Oaks. Also, in contrast to the primary slope
	forest, the forest floor is virtually free of shrubs and herbs and
	bears a heavy leaf mat.
<p>The descent to the floodplain of
	the mainstem Sawmill Branch is through increasingly rich forest
	similar to that of the west prong bottom.  It no doubt differs in
	species composition details, as in the presence of Slippery Elm (
	<i>Ulmus rubra  </i>).  However our traverse was largely occupied
	with the herbaceous layer.
<p>What follows is a listing of
	species other than trees encountered on the first traverse.  These
	are predominantly herbs but also include the many luxuriant mosses
	of the acidic west prong bottom and even a few animals.  The species
	are listed roughly in the sequence in which they were encountered,
	or rather, noticed.  First along the short section of the trail
	leading from the entrance:  Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens  </i>),
	Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia  </i>) and
	Round-leaf Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia  </i>), all very abundant,
	and the last-named the most abundant seen to that date anywhere by
	this observer.  Then conspicuous Golden Chantarelle mushroom
	(<i>Cantharellus cibarius  </i>), Common Speedwell (<i>Vernonica
	officinalis  </i>), Mountain Oat or Allegheny Flyback grass
	(<i>Danthonia compressa  </i>), largely in the trail, Plume Moss
	(<i>Ptilium crista-castrensis  </i>) and our rarest find, a single
	plant of Lesser Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera  repens  </i>) in
	bloom.  One of the few other locations reported for this plant is in
	the Hemlock groves of the Cathedral State Park to the north.  Next
	noted were Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola blanda  </i>), Lady Fern
	(<i>Anthyrium filix-femina  </i>), Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago
	curtisii  </i>) and rather stunted Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa
	  </i>).  Then crossing the bottom and stream to the southeast: 
	patches of Wild Stone Crop (<i>Sedum ternatum  </i>),Mountain Aster
	(<i>Aster acuminatus  </i>) and Alpine Enchanter&rsquo;s Nightshade
	(<i>Circ&aelig;a alpina  </i>), the last two usually being confined
	to high elevations or equivalent cool domains.  Here also, under
	moist, moss-covered rocks near the stream, we found a Dusky
	Salamander (<i>Desmognathus  fuscus  </i>), in our only real attempt
	to find salamanders.  Continuing on across the bottom, we
	encountered successively Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum
	 </i>), Shining Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium lucidulum  </i>), Mountain
	Fern Moss (<i>Hylocomium  splendens  </i>), Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea
	canadensis  </i>), Two-leaved Toothwort (<i>Dentaria diphylla  </i>),
	the Leafy Liverwort <i>Bazzania trilobata</i>, Hairy Disporum
	(<i>Disporum lanuginosum  </i>), Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium
	delicatatum   </i>), Wake Robin (<i>Trillium erectum  </i>), Wood
	Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquifolia  </i>), a single plant of Sharp -
	lobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica acutiloba  </i>), Creeping Phlox (<i>Phlox
	stolonifera  </i>), Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides  </i>),
	Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana  </i>), the sedge, <i>Carex
	gracillima</i>, a Haircap Moss  (<i>Polytrichum</i>  sp),   White
	Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium rugosum  </i>), an unidentified False
	Haircap Moss (<i>Atrichum</i>  sp.) and Canada Mayflower
	(<i>Mainathemum  canadense  </i>).
<p>On ascending the southwest slope in
	the vicinity of the large Sugar Maple and tree fall gap, the
	&ldquo;Fireweed&rdquo;<i> Erechtites hieracifolia</i>  was noted
	among saplings and rich herbage.  Other species encountered here
	were Halberd-leaf Violet (<i>Viola hastata  </i>), Palmate-leaf
	violet (<i>Viola palmata  </i>), Purple Bedstraw (<i>Galium
	latifolium  </i>), the Sedge <i>Carex digitalis</i>, an unidentified
	 <i>Clintonia</i>, Indian Pipe (<i> Monotropa uniflora  </i>),
	Virginia Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum  virginianum  </i>) and a
	rapidly moving wood vole.  In an unusually moist area on a mound of
	a recently toppled tree, there was a community consisting of
	Clearweed (<i>Pilea pumila  </i>), Christmas Fern (<i> Polystichum
	acrostichoides </i>),  Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennst&aelig;dtia
	punctilobula  </i>) a little Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa 
	</i>), Interrupted Fern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis  </i>), White Wood
	Sorrel (<i>Oxalis montana  </i>), Dutchman&rsquo;s Pipe Vine
	(<i>Aristolochia macrophylla  </i>) and the alien mints <i>Saturega
	vulgaris</i>  and <i>Galeopsis   tetrahit</i>.  Nearby associates
	were Smooth Gooseberry (<i>Ribes rotundifolium  </i>) and Maple-leaf
	Viburnum (<i>Viburnum acerifolium  </i>).
<p>In one place an unusual and very
	local association was encountered.  This was a close, almost
	intergrown mixture, of  Sharp - lobe Hepatica  and Canada Mayflower
	with Partridge Berry  (<i>Mitchella repens</i>)  only a few feet (
	less than one meter) distant.  The substrate for this association
	was soil in sandstone talus, indicating a likely acid reaction, as
	did two out of the three herbs present. As is well known, Sharp -
	lobe Hepatica is most common on calcareous terrain, so this
	occurrence seems to indicate that this species' stability extends
	into the acid range.
<p>After descending this slope toward
	the east, the traverse reached the Sawmill Branch mainstem bottom. 
	A partial list of species in the luxuriant herbaceous layer of the
	bottom included Canada Violet (<i>Viola canadensis  </i>), Blue
	Monkshood (<i>Aconitum uncinatum  </i>), Virginia Knotweed
	(<i>Polygonum virginianum  </i>), Maidenhair Fern  (<i>Adiantum</i>
	<i>pedatum</i>),   Barren Strawberry (<i>Waldsteinia fragarioides 
	</i>), Black Cohosh, Blue Cohosh, both species of Jewelweed
	(<i>Impatiens  capensis</i>  and <i>I. pallida  </i>), Tree Moss
	(<i>Climacium americanum  </i>), Foam Flower (<i>Tiarella cordifolia
	 </i>), Wood Nettle, Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>), Hog Peanut
	(<i>Amphicarpa bracteata  </i>) Crooked-stem Aster (<i>Aster
	prenanthoides  </i>), Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus  </i>),
	Broad-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago flexicaulis  </i>), Wide -leaved
	Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium purpureum), </i> Alpine  Enchanter&rsquo;s
	Nightshade, Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia)  </i> and, in
	one place, Bulbiferous Bladder Fern (<i>Cystopteris bulbifera  </i>)
	under a Slippery Elm sapling and rooted in organic flood debris.  It
	should be noted that all species in this list for which scientific
	names are given were not previously encountered in the traverse.  
<p>The traverse up the northeast
	ridge is through forest unlike the rich mesic stands encountered in
	the stream bottoms. Here it is dryer and perhaps more acidic than
	elsewhere in the Grove.  On the lower and middle slope the canopy is
	dominated by the large Hemlock,  but as the upper slope and ridge
	crest is approached there are increasing numbers of Northern Red and
	White Oaks with some Chestnut Oak  (<i>Quercus  prinus</i>)  near
	the top.  On the upper slope and ridge crest there are also large
	White Pine  (<i>Pinus  strobus</i>)  as well as Black Gum  (<i>Nyssa
	 sylvatica</i>),  Red Maple, Sassafras  (<i>Sassafras  albidum</i>) 
	and Pitch Pine  (<i>Pinus  rigida</i>).  White Pine increases in
	proportion along the ridge crest toward the northwest.
<p>Although no Red Spruce were seen on
	the first traverse, saplings of this tree are a conspicuous part of
	the understory along the upper slope toward the northwest.  Sizes
	range from tiny saplings and seedlings to some as large as nine
	inches (23 cm) dbh.  Also, while the bottomland contains few
	seedlings or saplings of Hemlock, they are far more abundant on the
	upper slope of this ridge and in some places form dense stands in
	the understory.
<p>While shrubs and herbaceous ground
	cover are both sparse on this southwest-facing slope, there is a
	systematic change in them with elevation.  Herbs noted on the lower
	and middle slope include Wood Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquefolia  </i>),
	Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium virginianum  </i>), Filmy Angelica
	(<i>Angelica triquinata  </i>), Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia
	 sessilifolia  </i>), Puttyroot (<i>Aplectrum hyemale  </i>) and
	Painted Trillium (<i>Trillium undulatum  </i>).  Lower trunks and
	roots of large trees were frequently moss-covered and <i>Leucobryum</i>
	 cushions were common.  A few patches of <i>Bazzania</i>  were also
	noted.  In one place there were spectacular glossy red conks of the
	Polypore fungus <i>Ganoderma tsug&aelig;</i>  on a long-dead Hemlock
	snag.  While lichens were uncommon on the darkly-shaded trunks,
	twigs fallen from the canopy bore growths of <i>Pseudevernia
	consocians</i> as well as other species.
<p>On the upper slope and ridge top,
	where light was available under a more deciduous canopy, Witch Hazel
	  (<i>Hamamelis  virginiana</i>) was more prominent,  a few shrubs
	of Upland Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum  </i>) and
	considerable Mountain Laurel  (<i>Kalmia  latifolia</i>)  moderated
	the open stands of large trees.  Here also we saw the first Teaberry
	(<i>Gaultheria procumbens  </i>), in confirmation of increased dry
	as well as acid soils.  However, on continuing along the ridge to
	the stand of large White Pine referred to earlier, there was again a
	change in ground cover, this time in the form of a virtually
	single-species occurrence of abundant Canada Mayflower in the thick
	needle duff beneath the pines.
<p>Although little time was available
	for observations of fauna, the presence of some large land snail
	shells is of interest.  Given the generally acid and probably
	low-lime soils in places such as this ridge, the presence of these
	animals attest to their ability to manufacture carbonate against an
	unfavorable environmental gradient.
<p>The different habitats of this
	small valley are an interesting study in contrasts.  The bottomland
	along the west prong stream of the Grove is clearly rich in plant
	growth, but with drainage from proximate sandstone and to a certain
	extent from the Greenbrier Limestone upstream, contains a number of
	acidiphile species.  This acid character is somewhat moderated on
	the northeast-facing slope and seems greatly diminished on the
	bottomland along the Sawmill Branch mainstem. Virtually every
	species recorded along the mainstem is either favored by or
	dependent on neutral or alkaline conditions.  Such species as
	Bladder Fern and Slippery Elm are particularly diagnostic.  Since
	this bottom is underlain by the same Pocono Sandstone as the
	bordering slopes  (Cardwell et al, 1968),  it is likely that the
	alkalinity and nutrient content of this habitat is strongly
	influenced by the Greenbrier Limestone just upstream.
<p>Contrasting greatly with the
	luxuriance of the herbaceous species along this bottom is the
	relatively dry, acidic and presumably nutrient-poor southwest-facing
	slope.  Here are large Hemlocks to be sure, but on the upper slope
	and ridge top these soon give way to xeric Oaks and pines, and
	nowhere is there significant herbaceous ground cover.
<p>The occurrence of Red Spruce in the
	understory on this slope poses an interesting question.  Is this
	tree moving into this area as a result of climatic change?  A more
	likely conclusion is that recent fire suppression has allowed this
	to occur.
<p>The Fanny Bennett grove lies on the
	lower south slope of Spruce Mountain with Spruce Knob just to the
	northeast  (see <a href=sprucek.htm>our section on Spruce Knob</a>).   Thus there is
	considerable potential for cold air drainage from the high slopes to
	the Grove.  This may explain the occurrence of such species as
	Mountain Ash and <i>Circ&aelig;a alpina</i>  here.  However the
	generally continuous slopes down-valley along Sawmill Branch
	indicates that this effect should not be large.
<p>Above all the Fanny Bennett Grove
	stands as a precious remnant of the forest&rsquo;s unsullied past
	and with unlimited potential as a source of information on what has
	been lost.
<p>The following is a list of fungi
	identified by R.Hunsucker from a collection made in the Fanny
	Bennett Hemlock Grove on 8-10-96: A &quot;c&quot; indicates
	occurrence also in the following list. In constructing these lists 
	Phillips  (1991)  and Miller  (1979)  were used to compile the list.
	However identification of species was based on a variety of
	resources.

<p>On comparing these two lists,
	we note that species growing on wood are about twice as frequent in
	the October, 2002 list as in that of August, 1996. This is probably
	largely attributable to the extreme drought conditions that
	prevailed in 2002, which may also explain the relatively small
	number of species found on the latter date, despite the presence of
	two experienced observers. By contrast, the period preceding the
	August, 1996 visit was one of considerable shower activity and cool
	temperatures, with July 4, 1996 the coolest ever experienced by this
	reporter  (personal journal, R. F. Mueller).  Another factor may be
	the lateness of the season on the October, 2002 visit, when a number
	of ground dwellers, such as the Amanitas, were past their prime
	season. It may illustrate the moisture - retaining properties of
	decayed wood  (see <a href=gaud.htm>our section on the Gaudineer Scenic Area</a>),  and
	also appears reflected in the occurrence, in this stand of primary
	coniferous forest, of a number of species requiring moist or damp
	soil.

	<h2>Source Walk: 8-1-03</h2>
	<ul>
	Our traverse this day, in
	late forenoon, had as its chief objective the collection of a suite
	of bryophytes in the most nutrient - rich part of the Grove, the
	mainstem bottom. Weather conditions were cool and overcast, with
	occasional drizzle, and followed a prolonged rainy period. While the
	herb and bryophyte floras were unusually luxuriant, with every rock
	and forest floor projection moss - covered, our spirits fell at the
	sight of  the magnificent Hemlock, which were greatly defoliated by
	the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid  (<i>Adelges  tsugae</i>).  Aspect had a
	very minor role in our collection. Although it was broadly south,
	the mean slope was gentle and the microtopography so rough that
	aspect varied greatly on this scale.
<p>Our collection began in the
	vicinity of the trail, immediately west of the entrance on the high
	terrace, above where the stream mainstem enters the Grove. This was
	an area of low acidiphile herbaceous vegetation consisting of such
	species as Round - leaf Violet,.  Partridge Berry and Intermediate
	Shield Fern. In what follows the habitats and habitat groups are
	numbered and their content of bryophyte taxa listed as  collected
	and identified by R. Hunsucker. Liverworts are followed by the
	symbol (Li), and mosses constitute the rest.

<p>In our previous studies of
	Central Appalachian forest types our major objectives were 1) the
	determination of possible  consistency between climatic, substrate
	and topographic influences and the floras, and 2) the internal
	consistency of the vascular and nonvascular floras and in some cases
	the fungi as well. In such examples as the Cathedral State Park, Tea
	Creek, Chimney Hollow, Reddish Knob, Ramsey's Draft, North River and
	other forest types, some fairly clear and consistent relations of
	these kinds were found. The unusually high nutrient soils and rich
	flora for a forest dominated by Hemlock at Fanny Bennett, are
	referred to above and elsewhere  (Mueller, 1998).  While both 
	Cathedral State Park and Fanny Bennett are old growth primary
	forests and bear a certain resemblance to each other in terms of
	their canopy species, they are very unlike in terms of nutrient
	availability, soil pH and floral diversity. While both forests are
	underlain by siliceous rocks with an expected acid reaction, at
	Fanny Bennett this is countered by the fluvial influence of the
	Greenbrier Limestone upstream. Thus pH values at Cathedral were
	uniformly low and the floras acidiphile and depauperate except where
	under the influence of human - introduced nutrients. Although only
	one soil pH value was determined at Fanny Bennett, this value is far
	higher than those of Cathedral and is consistent with the flora,
	which contains a number of calciphile vascular species. If we now
	consider the bryophyte flora of the richest bottomland forest types
	at Fanny Bennett, we see parallel relationships. First we note that
	the four most frequent species at <i>Cathedral, Brotherella 
	recurvans, Tetraphis  pellucida., Bazzania  trilobata</i> and
	<i>Nowellia  curvifolia</i> are considerably less frequent at Fanny
	Bennett but are still conspicuous, attesting to  certain
	similarities, such as a cool, humid environment that favors northern
	and montane species. Perhaps the greatest difference is shown by
	<i>Platygyrium  repens</i>, which has a low frequency at Cathedral,
	but is prominent at Fanny Bennett. According to Crum and Anderson (
	1981) this moss occurs in a wide variety of habitats but is rarely
	found on acid rocks. This antipathy, while perhaps not indicating a
	strong affinity for alkaline substrates, is consistent with the
	higher pH and calciphile flora at Fanny Bennett. Similarly, these
	characteristics account for the relatively demoted frequency of the
	strongly acidiphile <i>Tetraphis </i> <i>pellucida</i> in the latter
	forest. A number of the most common species here are widely
	distributed in a variety of habitats in eastern North America  (Crum
	and Anderson, 1981).  Examples are <i>Thuidium  delicatulum,</i> 
	<i>Hypnum  pallescens, Rhynchostegium  serrulatum, Anomodon 
	attenuatus, Brachythecium  oxycladon </i>and <i>Tortella  humilis. 
	Mnium  punctatum</i>, a species characteristic of cool seepy areas,
	appears in only one habitat here, in association with a springbrook,
	but is more frequent at Chimney Hollow in which several seeps were
	inventoried. It may be that in many cases the immediate substrate on
	which a bryophyte occurs is not the sole chemical influence since
	such substrates may be linked to surrounding soils, rock and organic
	matter by water films that have the capacity to transfer ions and
	other nutrients.
<p>A further comparison  with  Chimney
	Hollow and a diverse occurrence of bryophytes at Bad Branch in
	Kentucky  (Risk, 1998)  may cast further light on the Fanny Bennett
	community. The Bad Branch occurrence, like that of Chimney Hollow is
	dominated by siliceous, acidic substrates with no calcareous inputs,
	and shares a strong boreal component. Of the 68 bryophyte taxa at
	Chimney Hollow, 61 are mosses, and of these 38. or 62 %, are also
	found at Bad Branch. At Fanny Bennett 67 bryophyte taxa include 51
	mosses, of which only 28, or 55% occur at Bad Branch. Given the
	paucity of data and differences in these occurrences, not too much
	should be made of this comparison; yet it is consistent with the
	other data.
<p>
	The bryophyte suite discussed above
	likely falls short - perhaps far short - of that for the entire
	Grove. An indication is our 8 - 10 - 96 inventory during which we
	recorded Plume Moss  (<i>Ptilium  crista -</i> <i>castrensis </i>)
	and Mountain Fern Moss  (<i>Hylocomium  splendens</i>)  on the west
	prong bottom in what may have been a somewhat more acidic, but still
	nutrient - rich environment. It is also likely that a survey of the
	dryer upland forest of the northeast ridge would produce a somewhat
	different suite of bryophytes.</dl>
