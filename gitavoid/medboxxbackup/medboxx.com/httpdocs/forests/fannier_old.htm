<p> Among the few remnants of mesic
primary forest in the Central Appalachians, the Fanny Bennett tract is a
standout in its beauty and diversity. Although
only 65 acres (26 ha.) in area, it embraces two stream bottoms, slopes of both
northeast and southwest aspect and a ridge top. Technically a part of the Valley and Ridge Province, it is
located in an area of transition with many of the characteristics of the
Allegheny Mountains and Plateau. 
Elevations range from a little less than 3000 ft. (910 meters) to about
3250 ft. (990 meters) asl on a slope which rises continuously to Spruce Knob,
the highest point in West Virginia. 
Bedrock underlying the grove is Mississippian Pocono Group sandstone and
shale, but the Greenbrier Limestone lies just upslope and exerts its influence
through the drainage system (Cardwell et al, 1968) 
<p> The most convenient approach to the
Grove is via the Sawmill Branch Road from Route 28. This road follows the picturesque gorge of Sawmill Branch
upstream through a secondary but rich and diverse mesic forest. This forest is mixed mesophyte with Tuliptree
(<i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i>) at
its lower elevations of about 2500 ft (760 meters), but northern hardwood at
the Fanny Bennett Grove, where no Tuliptree was seen. A west-trending prong of Sawmill Branch passes through the center
of the Grove while the mainstem of this stream crosses its southeast edge.
<p> The 1993 and 1994 visits were brief
and generally occupied by introductory observations, while that of 1996
concentrated on the flora. 
Consequently, few observations of fauna were made. However the common
calls of Scarlet Tanagers (<i>Piranga
olivacea</i>) were noted in the June 1994 visit. Also on the 5-19-93 visit many tiny crayfish were seen in the
stream within the grove. Since August
is a quiet time for birds, few complicated our botanizing. Although we examined the stream in a cursory
way for aquatic life, little was in evidence at that time. This may have been a consequence of heavy
scour experienced by these streams during then-recent floods.
<p> The 8-10-96 traverses through the
Grove were more systematic than the previous visits. The first extended a little way along the established entrance
trail leading into the interior on the northeast side of the stream. It then crossed the stream bottom to the
slope on the southwest, ascended this slope to a terminating bench and curved
downward to the floodplain of the mainstem Sawmill Branch. Total length of this traverse was perhaps a
half mile (0.8 km). The second traverse
ascended the opposite slope to the northeast to the ridge crest, extended along
this crest to the northwest, descended to the interior stream and returned to
the entrance trail. This traverse was
perhaps a little longer than the first.
<p> The initial impression on entering
the grove is of a forest dominated by very mature if not old growth Hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>) . While the Hemlock are impressively tall, their girths do not
compare with some old growth specimens in other locales, as in Cathedral State
Park for example. Generally they do not
much exceed 3 feet (0.9 meters) dbh. 
Along the interior stream bottom the Hemlocks share dominance with Beech
(<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>), 
Sugar and Red Maples (<i>Acer 
saccharum</i> and <i>S. rubrum</i>), 
Yellow and Black Birches (<i>Betula alleghaniensis </i>and <i>B. lenta</i>), White Ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>), American Basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>) and Black Cherry (<i>Prunus serotina</i>) . A striking feature is the abundance of large dead snags, dead
falls and large woody debris. Debris
dams are common in the stream, which flows over a rocky bed of layered sandstone. While 
the understory and shrub layer are sparse along the stream bottom, there
is some Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>
), Alternate-leaf Dogwood (<i>Cornus
alternifolia</i>) and Hobblebush (<i>Viburnum
alnifolium </i>) . A few Mountain Ash (<i>Pyrus americana </i>) seedlings
were also noted. While Hemlock
dominates in this bottom, there are few seedlings or saplings of the species
and the same is also true of Red Spruce (<i>Picea rubens</i>), which occurs elsewhere in the Grove. As in other old growth Hemlock forests,
there is an aura here of cool serenity without gloom and a pervasive odor of
mouldering wood and fungi that is the essence of the slow uninterrupted slide
toward equilibrium between the organic and mineral worlds.
<p> The slope to the southwest of the
stream, where a northeast aspect prevails, is decidedly mesic and perhaps less acidic
than the interior stream bottom. Here
are some very large Sugar Maple and tree fall gaps where other old giants have
been toppled, perhaps aided by unstable soils on the steep slope. These gaps contain abundant saplings of
Sugar, Red and Striped Maple, Black Birch and a few Cucumber Magnolia (<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>) and many of these saplings
show evidence of continued soil creep in the form of curved and contorted
trunks. On the bench which tops this
mesic slope the old growth ends and is replaced by mature but secondary stands
consisting largely of Northern Red and
White Oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i> and <i>Quercus alba</i>) . 
Also, in contrast with the primary slope forest, the forest floor is
virtually free of shrubs and herbs and bears a heavy leaf mat.
<p> The descent to the floodplain of the
mainstem Sawmill Branch is through increasingly rich forest similar to that of
the interior bottom. It no doubt
differs in species composition details, as in the presence of Slippery Elm (<i>Ulmus rubra 
</i>). However our traverse was
largely occupied with the herbaceous layer.
<p> What follows is a listing of species
other than trees encountered on the first traverse. These are predominantly herbs but also include the many luxuriant
mosses of the acidic interior stream bottom and even a few animals. The species are listed roughly in the
sequence in which they were encountered, or rather, noticed. First along the short section of the trail
leading from the entrance: Partridge
Berry (<i>Mitchella repens </i>), Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia </i>) and Round-leaf Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia </i>), all very abundant, and the last-named the most abundant
seen to that date anywhere by this observer. 
Then conspicuous Golden Chantarelle mushroom (<i>Cantharellus cibarius </i>), 
Common Speedwell (<i>Vernonica
officinalis </i>), Mountain Oat or
Allegheny Flyback grass (<i>Danthonia
compressa </i>), largely in the trail,
Plume Moss (<i>Ptilium
crista-castrensis </i>) and our rarest
find, a single plant of Lesser Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera repens </i>) in bloom. One of the few other locations reported for this plant is in the
Hemlock groves of the Cathedral State Park to the north. Next noted were Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola blanda </i>), Lady Fern (<i>Anthyrium
filix-femina </i>), Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii </i>) and rather stunted Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa </i>) . Then crossing the bottom and stream to the
southeast: patches of Wild Stone Crop (<i>Sedum ternatum </i>), Mountain Aster (<i>Aster
acuminatus </i>) and Alpine Enchanter’s
Nightshade (<i>Circæa alpina </i>), the last two usually being confined
to high elevations or equivalent cool domains. 
Here also, under moist, moss-covered rocks near the stream, we found a
Dusky Salamander (<i>Desmognathus fuscus 
</i>) in our only real attempt. 
Continuing on across the bottom we encountered successively
Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium
triflorum </i>), Shining Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium lucidulum </i>), Mountain Fern Moss (<i>Hylocomium 
splendens </i>), Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis </i>), Two-leaved Toothwort (<i>Dentaria diphylla </i>), the Leafy Liverwort <i>Bazzania
trilobata</i>, Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum
lanuginosum </i>), Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatatum </i>), Wake Robin (<i>Trillium erectum </i>), Wood
Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquifolia </i>), a single plant of Sharp - lobe
Hepatica (<i>Hepatica acutiloba </i>), Creeping Phlox (<i>Phlox stolonifera </i>), Blue
Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides </i>), Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana </i>), the
sedge, <i>Carex gracillima</i>, a Haircap
Moss (<i>Polytrichum</i> sp), White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium
rugosum </i>), a False Haircap Moss (<i>Atrichum</i> sp.) and Canada Mayflower (<i>Mainathemum canadense 
</i>).
<p> On ascending the slope in the
vicinity of the large Sugar Maple and tree fall gap, the “Fireweed”<i>Erechtites hieracifolia</i> was noted in the latter among saplings and
rich herbage. Other species encountered
here were Halberd-leaf Violet (<i>Viola
hastata </i>), Palmate-leaf violet (<i>Viola palmata </i>), Purple Bedstraw (<i>Galium
latifolium </i>), the Sedge <i>Carex digitalis</i>, a <i>Clintonia</i>, Indian Pipe (<i>
Monotropa uniflora </i>), Virginia
Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum </i>) and a rapidly moving wood vole. In an unusually moist area on a mound of a
recently toppled tree there was a community consisting of Clearweed (<i>Pilea pumila </i>), Christmas Fern (<i>
Polystichum acrostichoides </i>), 
Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstædtia
punctilobula </i>) a little Black
Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa </i>), Interrupted Fern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis </i>), White Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis
montana </i>), Dutchman’s Pipe Vine (<i>Aristolochia macrophylla </i>) and the alien mints <i>Saturega vulgaris</i> and <i>Galeopsis
tetrahit</i>. Nearby associates were Smooth
Gooseberry (<i>Ribes rotundifolium </i>) and Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum acerifolium </i>) .
<p> In one place an unusual and very
local association was encountered. This
was a close, almost intergrown mixture,of 
Sharp - lobe Hepatica and Canada
Mayflower with Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella
repens</i>) only a few feet (one meter) distant. The substrate for this association was sandstone talus,
indicating a likely acid reaction, as did two out of the three herbs present.
As is well known, Sharp - lobe Hepatica is most common on calcareous terrain,
so this occurrence seems to indicate that this species' stability extends into
the acid range.
<p> After descending this slope toward
the southeast, the traverse reached the Sawmill Branch mainstem bottom. A partial list of species in the luxuriant
herbaceous layer of the bottom included Canada Violet (<i>Viola canadensis </i>), Blue
Monkshood (<i>Aconitum uncinatum </i>), Virginia Knotweed (<i>Polygonum virginianum </i>), Maidenhair Fern (<i>Adiantum</i> <i>pedatum</i> ), Barren
Strawberry (<i>Waldsteinia fragarioides </i>), Black Cohosh, Blue Cohosh, both
species of Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens capensis</i> and <i>I. pallida </i>), Tree Moss (<i>Climacium americanum </i>), 
Foam Flower (<i>Tiarella cordifolia </i>), Wood Nettle, Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>), Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata </i>) Crooked-stem Aster (<i>Aster prenanthoides </i>), Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus </i>), 
Broad-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago
flexicaulis </i>), Wide -leaved Joe-pye
Weed (<i>Eupatorium purpureum), </i>
Alpine Enchanter’s Nightshade, Common
Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia) </i> and, in one place, Bulbiferous Bladder Fern (<i>Cystopteris bulbifera </i>) under a Slippery Elm sapling and
rooted in organic flood debris. It
should be noted that all species in this list for which scientific names are
given were not previously encountered in the traverse. By and large they are usually found in more
alkaline or circum - neutral habitats than most of the species in the early
part of the traverse.
<p> The traverse up the northeast ridge
is through forest unlike the rich mesic stands encountered in the first
traverse. Here it is dryer and perhaps
more acidic than elsewhere in the Grove. 
On the lower and middle slope the canopy is dominated by the large
Hemlock but as the upper slope and ridge crest is approached there are
increasing numbers of Northern Red and White Oaks with some Chestnut Oak (<i>Quercus prinus</i>) near the top. On the upper slope and ridge crest there are
also large White Pine (<i>Pinus 
strobus</i>) as well as Black Gum (<i>Nyssa sylvatica</i>), Red Maple, Sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>) and Pitch Pine (<i>Pinus rigida</i>) . White Pine increases in
proportion along the ridge crest toward the northwest.
<p> Although no Red Spruce were seen on
the first traverse, saplings of this tree are a conspicuous part of the
understory along the upper slope toward the northwest. Sizes range from tiny saplings and seedlings
to some as large as nine inches (23 cm) dbh. 
Also, while the bottomland contains few seedlings or saplings of
Hemlock, they are far more abundant on the upper slope of this ridge and in
some places form dense stands in the understory.
<p> While shrubs and herbaceous ground
cover are both sparse on this southwest-facing slope, there is a systematic
change in them with elevation. Herbs
noted on the lower and middle slope include Wood Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquefolia </i>), 
Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium
virginianum </i>), Filmy Angelica (<i>Angelica triquinata </i>), Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia sessifolia </i>), Puttyroot (<i>Aplectrum hyemale </i>) and
Painted Trillium (<i>Trillium undulatum </i>) . 
Lower trunks and roots of large trees were frequently moss-covered and <i>Leucobryum</i> cushions were common. A
few patches of <i>Bazzania</i> were also noted. In one place there were spectacular glossy red conks of the
Polypore fungus <i>Ganoderma tsugæ</i> on a long-dead Hemlock snag. While lichens were uncommon on the
darkly-shaded trunks, twigs fallen from the canopy bore growths of <i>Pseudevernia consocians</i> as well as other
species.
<p> On the upper slope and ridge top,
where light was available under a more deciduous canopy, Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i>) was more prominent, a few shrubs of Upland Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum </i>) and
considerable Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia 
latifolia</i>) moderated the open stands of large trees. Here also we saw the first Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens </i>), in confirmation of increased dry as
well as acid soils. However, on
continuing along the ridge to the stand of large White Pine referred to
earlier, there was again a change in ground cover, this time in the form of a
virtually single-species occurrence of abundant Canada Mayflower in the thick
needle duff beneath the pines.
<p> Although little time was available
for observations of fauna, the presence of some large land snail shells is of
interest. Given the generally acid and
probably low-lime soils in places such as this ridge, the presence of these
animals attest to their ability to manufacture carbonate against an unfavorable
environmental gradient.
<p> The different habitats of this small
valley are an interesting study in contrasts. 
The bottomland along the interior stream of the Grove is clearly rich in
plant growth but with drainage from proximate sandstone and to a certain extent
from the Greenbrier Limestone upstream. 
This acid character is somewhat moderated on the northeast-facing slope
and seems entirely neutralized on the bottomland along the Sawmill Branch
mainstem. Virtually every species recorded along the mainstem is either favored
or dependent on neutral or alkaline conditions. Such species as Bladder Fern and Slippery Elm are particularly
diagnostic. Since this bottom is
underlain by the same Pocono Sandstone as the bordering slopes (Cardwell et
al, 1968), it is likely that the alkalinity and nutrient content of this
habitat is strongly influenced by the Greenbrier Limestone just upstream.
<p> Contrasting greatly with the
luxuriance of the herbaceous species along this bottom is the relatively dry,
acidic and presumably nutrient-poor southwest-facing slope. Here are large Hemlocks to be sure, but on
the upper slope and ridge top these soon give way to xeric Oaks and pines, and
nowhere is there significant herbaceous ground cover.
<p> The occurrence of Red Spruce in the
understory on this slope poses an interesting question. Is this tree moving into this area as a
result of climatic change? A more
likely conclusion is that recent fire suppression has allowed this to occur.
<p> The Fanny Bennett grove lies on the
lower south slope of Spruce Mountain with Spruce Knob just to the northeast (
see our section on Spruce Knob) . Thus
there is considerable potential for cold air drainage from the high slopes to
the Grove. This may explain the
occurrence of such species as Mountain Ash and <i>Circæa alpina</i> here. However the generally continuous slopes
down-valley along Sawmill Branch indicates that this effect should not be
large.
<p> Above all the Fanny Bennett Grove
stands as a precious remnant of the forest’s unsullied past and with unlimited
potential as a source of information on what has been lost.
<p> The following is a list of fungi
identified by R.Hunsucker from a collection made in the Fanny Bennett Hemlock
Grove on 8 - 10 - 96: a &quot;c&quot; indicates occurrence also in the
following list. In constructing these lists

<p>&nbsp;
<p> On
comparing these two lists, we note that species growing on wood are about twice
as frequent in the October, 2002 list as in that of August, 1996. This is
probably largely attributable to the extreme drought conditions that prevailed
in 2002, which may also explain the relatively small number of species found on
the latter date, despite the presence of two experienced observers. By
contrast, the period preceding the August, 1996 visit was one considerable
shower activity and cool temperatures, with July 4, 1996 the coolest ever
experienced by this reporter (personal journal, R. F. Mueller) . Another
factor may be the lateness of the season on the October, 2002 visit, when a
number of ground dwellers, such as the Amanitas, were past their prime season.
It may also illustrate the moisture - retaining properties of decayed wood (
see our section on the Gaudineer Scenic Area) and also appears reflected in
the occurrence, in this stand of primary coniferous forest, of a number of
species requiring moist or damp soil.
