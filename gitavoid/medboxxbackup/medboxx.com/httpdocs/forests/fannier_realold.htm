Although only 65 acres (26 ha.) in area, it embraces two stream bottoms, slopes of both northeast and southwest aspect and a ridge top. Technically a part of the Valley and Ridge Province, it is located in an area of transition with many of the characteristics of the Allegheny Mountains and Plateau. Elevations range from a little less than 3000 ft. (910 meters) to about 3250 ft. (990 meters) asl on a slope which rises continuously to Spruce Knob, the highest point in West Virginia. Bedrock underlying the grove is Mississipian Pocono Group sandstone and shale, but the Greenbrier Limestone lies just upslope and exerts its influence through the drainage system.</P><P>&#9;The most convenient approach to the Grove is via the Sawmill Branch Road from Route 28. This road follows the picturesque gorge of Sawmill Branch upstream through a secondary but rich and diverse mesic forest. This forest is mixed mesophyte with Tuliptree at its lower elevations of about 2500 ft (760 meters), but northern hardwood at the Fanny Bennett Grove, where no Tuliptree was seen. A west-tending prong of Sawmill Branch passes through the center of the Grove while the mainstem of this stream crosses its southeast edge.</P><P>&#9;The 1993 and 1994 visits were brief and generally occupied by introductory observations, while that of 1996 concentrated on the flora. Consequently, few observations of fauna were made. However the common calls of Scarlet Tanagers ( <I>Piranga olivacea</I> ) were noted in the June 1994 visit. Also on the 5-19-93 visit many tiny crayfish were seen in the stream within the grove. Since August is a quiet time for birds, few complicated our botanizing. Although we examined the stream in a cursory way for aquatic life, little was in evidence at that time. This may have been a consequence of heavy scour experienced by these streams during then-recent floods.</P><P>&#9;The 8-10-96 traverses through the Grove were more systematic than the previous visits. The first extended a little way along the established entrance trail leading into the interior on the northeast side of the stream. It then crossed the stream bottom to the slope on the southwest, ascended this slope to a terminating bench and curved downward to the floodplain of the mainstem Sawmill Branch. Total length of this traverse was perhaps a half mile (0.8 km). The second traverse ascended the opposite slope to the northeast to the ridge crest, extended along this crest to the northwest, descended to the interior stream and returned to the entrance trail. This traverse was perhaps a little longer than the first.</P><p><center><img src="jpegs/fanny.jpg" width=300 height=443 alt="" border="0"><br>Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove<br>8-10-96<br></center><p><p><center><img src="jpegs/mayflower.jpg" width=250 height=256 alt="" border="0"><br>Canada Mayflower and Sharplobe Hepatica<br>Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove 8-10-96</center><p><P>&#9;The initial impression on entering the grove is of a forest dominated by very mature if not old growth Hemlock. While the Hemlock are impressively tall, their girths do not compare with some old growth specimens in other locales, as in Cathedral State Park for example. Generally they do not much exceed 3 feet (0.9 meters) dbh. Along the interior stream bottom the Hemlocks share dominance with Beech, Sugar and Red Maples, Yellow and Black Birches, White Ash, American Basswood and Black Cherry. A striking feature is the abundance of large dead snags, dead falls and large woody debris. Debris dams are common in the stream, which flows over a rocky bed of layered sandstone. While the understory and shrub layer are sparse along the stream bottom, there is some Striped Maple, Alternate-leaf Dogwood ( <I>Cornus alternifolia</I> ) and Hobblebush (<I>Viburnum alnifolium </I>). A few Mountain Ash (<I>Pyrus americana </I>) seedlings were also noted. While Hemlock dominates in this bottom, there are few seedlings or saplings of the species and the same is also true of Red Spruce, which occurs elsewhere in the Grove. As in other old growth Hemlock forests, there is an aura here of cool serenity without gloom and a pervasive odor of mouldering wood and fungi that is the essence of the slow uninterrupted slide toward equilibrium between the organic and mineral worlds.</P><P>&#9;The slope to the southwest of the stream,where a northeast aspect prevails, is decidedly mesic and perhaps less acidic than the interior stream bottom. Here are some very large Sugar Maple and tree fall gaps where other old giants have been toppled, perhaps aided by unstable soils on the steep slope. These gaps contain abundant saplings of Sugar, Red and Striped Maple, Black Birch and a few Cucumber Magnolia and many of these saplings show evidence of continued soil creep in the form of curved and contorted trunks. On the bench which tops this mesic slope the old growth ends and is replaced by mature but secondary stands consisting largely of Northern Red and White Oak. Also, in contrast with the primary slope forest, the forest floor is virtually free of shrubs and herbs and bears a heavy leaf mat.</P><P>&#9;The descent to the floodplain of the mainstem Sawmill Branch is through increasingly rich forest similar to that of the interior bottom. It no doubt differs in species composition details, as in the presence of Slippery Elm ( <I>Ulmus rubra </I>). However our traverse was largely occupied with the herbaceous layer.</P><P>&#9;What follows is a listing of species other than trees encountered on the first traverse. These are predominantly herbs but also include the many luxuriant mosses of the acidic interior stream bottom and even a few animals. The species are listed roughly in the sequence in which they were encountered, or rather, noticed. First along the short section of the trail leading from the entrance: Partridge Berry (<I>Mitchella repens </I>), Spinulose Shield Fern (<I>Dryopteris intermedia </I>) and Round-leaf Violet (<I>Viola rotundifolia </I>), all very abundant, and the last-named the most abundant seen to that date anywhere. Then conspicuous Golden Chantarelle mushroom (<I>Cantharellus cibarius </I>), Common Speedwell (<I>Vernonica officinalis </I>), Allegheny Flyback grass (<I>Danthonia compressa </I>), largely in the trail, Plume Moss(<I>Ptilium crista-castrensis </I>) and our rarest find, a single plant of Lesser Rattlesnake Plantain (<I>Goodyera repens </I>) in bloom. One of the few locations reported for this plant is in the Hemlock groves of the Cathedral State Park to the north. Next noted were Sweet White Violet (<I>Viola blanda </I>), Lady Fern (<I>Anthyrium filix-femina </I>), Curtis Goldenrod (<I>Solidago curtisii </I>) and rather stunted Plume Lily (<I>Smilacina racemosa </I>). Then crossing the bottom and stream to the southeast: patches of Wild Stone Crop (<I>Sedum ternatum </I>),Mountain Aster (<I>Aster acuminatus </I>) and Alpine Enchanter’s Nightshade (<I>Circ&aelig;a alpina </I>), the last two usually being confined to high elevations or equivalent cool domains. Here also, under moist, moss-covered rocks near the stream, we found a Dusky Salamander (<I>Desmognathus fuscus </I>) in our only real attempt. Continuing on across the bottom we encountered successively Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<I>Galium triflorum </I>), Shining Clubmoss (<I>Lycopodium lucidulum </I>), Mountain Fern Moss (<I>Hylocomium splendens </I>), Wood Nettle (<I>Laportea canadensis </I>), Two-leaved Toothwort (<I>Dentaria diphylla </I>), the Leafy Liverwort <I>Bazzania trilobata</I>, Hairy Disporum (<I>Disporum lanuginosum </I>), Delicate Fern Moss (<I>Thuidium delicatatum </I>), Wake Robin (<I>Trillium erectum </I>), Wood Anemone (<I>Anemone quinquifolia </I>), a single plant of Sharplobe Hepatica (<I>Hepatica acutiloba </I>), Creeping Phlox (<I>Phlox stolonifera </I>), Blue Cohosh (<I>Caulophyllum thalictroides </I>), Cucumber-root (<I>Medeola virginiana </I>), the sedge, <I>Carex gracillima</I>, a Haircap Moss ( <I>Polytrichum</I> sp ), White Snakeroot (<I>Eupatorium rugosum </I>), a False Haircap Moss (<I>Atrichum</I> sp.) and Canada Mayflower (<I>Mainathemum canadense </I>).</P><P>&#9;On ascending the slope in the vicinity of the large Sugar Maple and tree fall gap, the "Fireweed"<I> Erechtites hieracifolia</I> was noted in the latter among saplings and rich herbage. Other species encountered here were Halberd-leaf Violet (<I>Viola hastata </I>), Palmate-leaf violet (<I>Viola palmata </I>), Purple Bedstraw (<I>Galium latifolium </I>), the Sedge <I>Carex digitalis</I>, a <I>Clintonia</I>, Indian Pipe (<I> Monotropa uniflora </I>), Virginia Waterleaf (<I>Hydrophyllum virginianum </I>) and a rapidly moving wood vole. In an unusually moist area on a mound of a recently toppled tree there was a community consisting of Clearweed (<I>Pilea pumila </I>), Christmas Fern (<I> Polystichum acrostichoides </I>), Hay-scented Fern (<I>Dennst&aelig;dtia punctilobula </I>) a little Black Cohosh (<I>Cimicifuga racemosa </I>), Interrupted Fern (<I>Onoclea sensibilis </I>), White Wood Sorrel (<I>Oxalis montana </I>), Dutchman’s Pipe Vine (<I>Aristolochia macrophylla </I>) and the alien mints <I>Saturega vulgaris</I> and <I>Galeopsis tetrahit</I>. Nearby associates were Smooth Gooseberry (<I>Ribes rotundifolium </I>) and Maple-leaf Viburnum (<I>Viburnum acerifolium </I>).</P><P>&#9;In one place an unusual and very local association was encountered. This was a close, almost intergrown mixture,of <I>Hepatica acutiloba</I> and <I>Maianthemum canadense</I> with <I>Mitchella repens</I> only a few feet (one meter) distant. The substrate for this association was sandstone talus, indicating a likely acid reaction,as did two out of the three herbs present.</P><P>&#9;After descending this slope toward the southeast, the traverse reached the Sawmill Branch mainstem bottom. A partial list of species in the luxuriant herbaceous layer of the bottom included Canada Violet (<I>Viola canadensis </I>), Blue Monkshood (<I>Aconitum uncinatum </I>), Virginia Knotweed (<I>Polygonum virginianum </I>), Maidenhair Fern ( <I>Adiantum</I> <I>pedatum</I> ), Barren Strawberry (<I>Waldsteinia fragarioides </I>), Black Cohosh, Blue Cohosh, both species of Jewelweed (<I>Impatiens capensis</I> and <I>I. pallida </I>), Tree Moss (<I>Climacium americanum </I>), Foam Flower (<I>Tiarella cordifolia </I>), Wood Nettle, Turtlehead (<I>Chelone glabra</I>), Hog Peanut (<I>Amphicarpa bracteata </I>) Crooked-stem Aster (<I>Aster prenanthoides </I>), Big-leaf Aster (<I>Aster macrophyllus </I>), Broad-leaf Goldenrod (<I>Solidago flexicaulis </I>), Wide -leaved Joe-pye Weed (<I>Eupatorium purpureum ),</I> Alpine Enchanter’s Nightshade, Common Greenbrier (<I>Smilax rotundifolia ) </I>and, in one place, Bulbiferous Bladder Fern (<I>Cystopteris bulbifera </I>) under a Slippery Elm sapling and rooted in organic flood debris. It should be noted that all species in this list for which scientific names are given were not previously encountered in the traverse. By and large they are usually found in more alkaline or circumneutral habitats than most of the species in the early part of the traverse.</P><P>&#9;The traverse up the northeast ridge is through forest unlike the rich mesic stands encountered in the first traverse. Here it is dryer and perhaps more acidic than elsewhere in the Grove. On the lower and middle slope the canopy is dominated by the large Hemlock but as the upper slope and ridge crest is approached there are increasing numbers of Northern Red and White Oaks with some Chestnut Oak near the top. On the upper slope and ridge crest there are also large White Pine as well as Black Gum, Red Maple, Sassafras and Pitch Pine. White Pine increases in proportion along the ridge crest toward the northwest.</P><P>&#9;Although no Red Spruce were seen on the first traverse, saplings of this tree are a conspicuous part of the understory along the upper slope toward the northwest. Sizes range from tiny saplings and seedlings to some as large as nine inches (23 cm) dbh. Also, while the bottomland contains few seedlings or saplings of Hemlock, they are far more abundant on the upper slope of this ridge and in some places form dense stands in the understory.</P><P>&#9;While shrubs and herbaceous ground cover are both sparse on this southwest-facing slope, there is a systematic change in them with elevation. Herbs noted on the lower and middle slope include Wood Anemone (<I>Anemone quinquefolia </I>), Rattlesnake Fern (<I>Botrychium virginianum </I>), Filmy Angelica (<I>Angelica triquinata </I>), Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<I>Uvularia sessifolia </I>), Puttyroot (<I>Aplectrum hyemale </I>) and Painted Trillium (<I>Trillium undulatum </I>). Lower trunks and roots of large trees were frequently moss-covered and <I>Leucobryum</I> cushions were common. A few patches of <I>Bazzania</I> were also noted. In one place there were spectacular glossy red conks of the Polypore fungus <I>Ganoderma tsug&aelig;</I> on a long-dead Hemlock snag. While lichens were uncommon on the darkly-shaded trunks, twigs fallen from the canopy bore growths of <I>Pseudevernia consocians</I> as well as other species.</P><P>&#9;On the upper slope and ridge top,where light was available under a more deciduous canopy, Witch Hazel was more prominent, a few shrubs of Upland Low Blueberry (<I>Vaccinium pallidum </I>) and considerable Mountain Laurel moderated the open stands of large trees. Here also we saw the first Teaberry (<I>Gaultheria procumbens </I>), in confirmation of increased dry as well as acid soils. However, on continuing along the ridge to the stand of large White Pine referred to earlier, there was again a change in ground cover, this time in the form of a virtually single-species occurrence of abundant Canada Mayflower in the thick needle duff beneath the pines.</P><P>&#9;Although little time was available for observations of fauna, the presence of some large land snail shells is of interest. Given the generally acid and probably low-lime soils in places such as this ridge, the presence of these animals attest to their ability to manufacture carbonate against an unfavorable environmental gradient.</P><P>&#9;The different habitats of this small valley are an interesting study in contrasts. The bottomland along the interior stream of the Grove is clearly rich in plant growth but with drainage from proximate sandstone and to a certain extent from the Greenbrier Limestone upstream. This acid character is somewhat moderated on the northeast-facing slope and seems entirely neutralized on the bottomland along the Sawmill Branch mainstem.Virtually every species recorded along the mainstem is either favored or dependent on neutral or alkaline conditions. Such species as Bladder Fern and Slippery Elm are particularly diagnostic. Since this bottom is underlain by the same Pocono Sandstone as the bordering slopes, it is likely that the alkalinity and nutrient content of this habitat is strongly influenced by the Greenbrier Limestone just upstream.</P><P>&#9;Contrasting greatly with the luxuriance of the herbaceous species along this bottom is the relatively dry, acidic and presumably nutrient-poor southwest-facing slope. Here are large Hemlocks to be sure, but on the upper slope and ridge top these soon give way to xeric Oaks and pines, and nowhere is there significant herbaceous ground cover.</P><P>&#9;The occurrence of Red Spruce in the understory on this slope poses an interesting question. Is this tree moving into this area as a result of climatic change? A more likely conclusion is that recent fire suppression has allowed this to occur.</P><P>&#9;The Fanny Bennett grove lies on the lower south slope of Spruce Mountain with Spruce Knob just to the northeast ( see our section on Spruce Knob ). Thus there is considerable potential for cold air drainage from the high slopes to the grove. This may explain the occurrence of such species as Mountain Ash and <I>Circ&aelig;a alpina</I> here. However the generally continuous slopes down-valley along Sawmill Branch indicates that this effect should not be large.</P><P>&#9;Above all the Fanny Bennett Grove stands as a precious remnant of the forest’s unsullied past and with unlimited potential as a source of information on what has been lost.</P><P>&#9;The following is a list of fungi identified by R.Hunsucker from a collection made in the Grove in August :<p><table width=100%><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>Amanita flavoconia</I></td><td><i><font face=arial>C.dryophila</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>A.pantherina</td><td><i><font face=arial>Mycena leaiana</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>A.ceciliae</td><td><i><font face=arial>Oudenmansiella radicata</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>A.fulva</td><td><i><font face=arial>Hygrocybe flavescens</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>A.rubescens</I></td><td><i><font face=arial>H.marginatus</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>A.citrina</td><td><i><font face=arial>Laccaria laccata</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>A.virosa complex</td><td><i><font face=arial>Entoloma murraii</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>Lepiota cristata</td><td><i><font face=arial>Naematoloma sublateritium</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>Lactarius lignyotus</td><td><i><font face=arial>Phylloporus rhdoxanthus</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>L.subpurpureus</td><td><i><font face=arial>Crepidotus mollis</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>Russula cf flavida</td><td><i><font face=arial>C.applanatus</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>R. sp</td><td><i><font face=arial>Inocybe </I>spp</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>Leptonia serrulata</td><td><i><font face=arial>Cortinarius corrugatus</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>Xeramphalina kaufmannii</td><td><i><font face=arial>C.</I>sp</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>Pleurotus porrigens</td><td><i><font face=arial>Cantherellus cibarius</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>Panellus stipticus</I><I></td><td><i><font face=arial>Craterellus fallax</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>Armillariella mellea</td><td><i><font face=arial>Clavaria dolphus pistillaris</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>Marasmius siccus</td><td><i><font face=arial>Clavulinopsis fusiformis</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>M.rotula</I></td><td><i><font face=arial><I>Ramaria</I> spp</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>Clitocybe robusta</I></td><td><i><font face=arial><I>Strobilomyces floccopus</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>C.gibba</I></td><td><i><font face=arial><I>Tylopilus indecisus</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>C.trullaeformis</I></td><td><i><font face=arial><I>Suillus pictus</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>C.</I>spp</td><td><i><font face=arial><I>S.granulatus</td></tr><tr><td><i><font face=arial><I>Collybia confluens</I></td><td><i><font face=arial><I>S. </I>spp</td></tr><tr></tr></table><br>&#9;<br>&#9;<I>Leccinum scabrum</I><br>&#9;<I>Boletus badius</I><br>&#9;<I>B.affina</I><br>&#9;<I>B.</I> spp<br>&#9;<I>Austroboletus gracilis</I><br>&#9;<I>Ganoderma applanatum</I><br>&#9;<I>G.tsugae</I><br>&#9;<I>Fomes fomentarius</I><br>&#9;<I>Daedaliopsis confragosa</I><br>&#9;<I>Trametes versicolor</I><br>&#9;<I>Cerrena unicolor</I><br>&#9;<I>Trichaptum biforme</I><br>&#9;<I>Scleroderma citrinum</I><br>&#9;<I>Lycoperdon marginatum</I><br>&#9;<I>L.perlatum<br>Tremella mesontarica &#9;&#9;</I><br>&#9;<I>Pseudohydnum gelatinosum</I><br>&#9;<I>Leotia lubrica </I><br>&#9;<I>Sphatularia velutipes</I><br>&#9;<I>Tyromyces chioneus</I><br>&#9;<I>Stereum ostrea</I><br>&#9;<I>S.complicatum</I><br>&#9;<I>Ramariopsis kunzoi</I><br>&#9;<I>Aleuria aurantia</I><br>&#9;<I>Bulgaria inquinans</I><br>&#9;<I>Trichoglossum </I>sp<br>&#9;<I>Hypomyces hyalinus</I><br>&nbsp;</ul><a href=".">Back to Forests of the Central Appalachians</a> | <a href="feedback.php">Feedback</a><p><P></font></BODY></HTML>
