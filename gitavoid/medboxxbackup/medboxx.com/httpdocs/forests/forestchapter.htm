<h2>Major
Forest Types</h2>
<ul>
<p>	To
the casual observer Appalachian Mountain forests appear as an almost
uniform blanket of green covering hills, valleys and the loftiest
ridges. They generally show little color
contrast except in autumn and as a result the terrain appears to lack
the scenic diversity of western landscapes with their sharp tree
lines and soaring cliffs. There are
exceptions to this uniformity in the high Alleghenies where jagged
spruce spires form the skyline, in the striking water gaps which mark
where rivers have cut through ranges and where resistant beds such as
Tuscarora sandstone shine white above the trees. But
these are exceptions. Yet there is an
underlying, although cryptic, diversity in these forests that is in
its way as impressive as that of any landscape. In
part this reflects the different exposed rock types and in part
mountain-related climate contrasts particularly in moisture
availability. The degree of cloud cover may also play an important
role. The diversity of habitats created
by these factors results in a number of different forest types which
are readily distinguished, even by the untrained eye when in close
proximity to them. To illustrate, two
deciduous forests could hardly differ more than those of the dry
ridges of the Valley and Ridge and those of the moist slopes of the
Allegheny Plateau. The ridge forests
consist dominantly of shiny leaved, thick barked Chestnut Oak (<i>Quercus  prinus</i>)  or at higher elevations Northern Red Oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>)  with minor hickories and pines.
Frequently trunks and limbs are distorted by
harsh growing conditions and the forest floor is covered by a thick
leaf mat. Few herbaceous plants penetrate this leaf mat but there is
a variety of low heath shrubs such as Mountain Laurel  (<i>Kalmia 
latifolia</i>),  huckleberries and blueberries, which are favored by
the additional light provided by rather thin canopies as well as the
highly acidic soils. Where the leaf mat
is thinner, light green cushion mosses (<i>Leucobryum</i> sp.),
&ldquo;Reindeer moss&rdquo;  (<i>Cladonia</i> sp),  a lichen, or
clumps of Curly-leaved Poverty Grass  (<i>Danthonia</i> spp.)  
appear. In some places there are
scattered little shiny leaved Teaberry
(<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>) plants with bright red aromatic
berries. Fire is at home here as
evidenced by many basal trunk scars and charred wood.</p>
<p>	By
contrast the medium moist  (mesic) Allegheny forests are dominated by
species such as Sugar Maple  (<i>Acer  saccharum</i>),  Beech  (<i>Fagus
 grandifolia</i>)  and birches or in some cases by ash and basswood.
Except for Beech these trees have thin juicy
leaves that decay readily so there is little leaf litter except
during autumn. In the case of maple and
beech crown foliage is heavier than that of oaks and there is a green
ethereal light even at midday.
Ferns and spring wildflowers in great variety
carpet the forest floor in places and heaths are replaced by
viburnums and other tall shrubs. Trees,
except for the oldest, are relatively smooth barked since they need
to withstand fewer fires and abundant moisture allows them to grow
straight and tall. Many species of
birds, amphibians and other animals are far more abundant here than
in the oak forests as indicated by the frequencies of bird calls.
Yet the oak forests are rich in nutritious
food sources such as acorns for Black Bears and other mammals.</p>
<p>	The
two contrasting forest types discussed above grade into even more
differentiated types. Oak forest on
exposed ridges in some places give way to open heath &ldquo;barrens&rdquo;
in which heath bushes and stunted tress dominate, usually with
scattered taller and wind-deformed Pitch
Pine  (<i>Pinus  rigida</i>).  Such
terrain is in part the result of frequent fires. On
the other hand the rich mesic Allegheny hardwood forest grades into
spruce forest at higher elevations in which there are few shrubs or
herbaceous plants but rather a thick ground cover of mosses and leafy
liverworts with some ferns and lycopods. It
is a dark forest of deep shade and cool moisture unlike any other in
the Central Appalachians. Many other
contrasting forest types are considered in our detailed inventories (&quot;Forest Walks&quot;). </p>
<p>	In
addition to these large scale variations of major forest types, there
is also a patchiness within them related to
local rock and soil variation. For
example in the Shenandoah Valley forest communities vary greatly
depending on the nature and depth of bedrock. On
uplands underlain by Ordovician Beekmantown dolomite cherty hilltops
and deep soil may support White Oak  (<i>Quercus  alba</i>) -Black
Oak  (<i>Quercus</i>  <i>velutina </i>) forest with Red Maple  (<i>Acer
rubrum</i>)  and ericaceous ground cover, indicating acid
conditions despite underlying carbonate rocks.
Talus slopes with SE aspect support a
more mesic forest rich in hickories, Black Walnut  (<i>Juglans  nigra</i>
), Slippery Elm  (<i>Ulmus  rubra</i>),  Bitternut Hickory  (<i>Carya
</i> <i>cordiformis</i>)  and White Ash  (<i>Fraxinus </i> <i>americana
</i>), while patches with near surface
dolomite have Chinquapin Oak  (<i>Quercus  muhlenbergii</i>)  and
White Ash. These patches may be less
than an acre in size and indicate alkaline conditions while all three
forest types may occur in less than five acres.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>	The
most complex and presumed parent forest of the Central Appalachians
is the Mixed Mesophytic. This type
derived from similar forests that occupied eastern North American and
other centers such as Europe and East Asia since
Tertiary times  (Braun, 1950),  although subject to climate-induced
migrations. Thus many species of the
European forests were eliminated when ice sheets forced them against
inhospitable east-west mountain ranges and seas. However
those of East Asia survived and many of the closest relatives of
eastern North American species still live there. This
correspondence between East Asian and American flora was recognized
as early as 1846 by the famous botanist Asa Gray. The
Mixed Mesophyte forest shows its most characteristic development in
the Cumberland Mountains and in the Alleghenies of West Virginia
below 2500 ft. (760 meters) asl. It also
extends northward with attenuated diversity into Ohio,
Maryland and Pennsylvania where it is
increasingly confined to stream valleys. Eastward
in Virginia it is largely restricted to topographic concavities such
as coves, ravines and riparian zones, usually of the latest erosion
cycle.</p>
<p>	The
Mixed Mesophyte forest is diverse with a number <u>of </u>species
each of magnolias, oaks, hickories, walnuts, elms, birches, ashes,
maples, basswoods, locusts and pines. There
is also Tuliptree  (<i>Liriodendron  tulipifera</i>),  Black and
Sweet Gum  (<i>Nyssa sylvatica </i>and <i>Liquidambar  styrocifula</i>
), Black Cherry  (<i>Prunus  serotina</i>),  American Beech and
Canadian Hemlock  (<i>Tsuga  canadensis</i>).  The
most characteristic type indicators are White Basswood  (<i>Tilia 
heterophylla </i>or <i>T</i>.<i> americana</i>  var <i>heterophylla </i>)
and Yellow Buckeye   (<i>Aesculus  octandra</i>).  However
Yellow Buckeye does not generally occur in the Valley and Ridge.
American Chestnut  (<i>Castanea  dentata</i>), 
once a major component, now survives only as stunted, disease-ridden
sprouts. These major canopy species are
accompanied by even more diverse understory tree, shrub and
herbaceous layers as well as many fungi, mosses, etc. Typical
components of the understory are the small trees Muscletree
 (<i>Carpinus</i><i> caroliniana </i>)
and Sourwood  (<i>Oxydendron</i><i> arboreum</i>
), shrubs such as Spice Bush  (<i>Lindera</i><i> benzoin</i>
)  and Paw Paw  (<i>Asimina</i><i> triloba</i>
) and the herbs Ginseng  (<i>Panax</i><i> quinquefolius
</i>) and Goldenseal  (<i>Hydrastis</i><i>
canadensis</i> ) 
and many more. As previously stated,
mesophytic plants, including the trees, tend to have soft, juicy
leaves that on death rapidly decompose and, as distinguished from
those of xeric oak forests, form only light litter but contribute to
building rich soils.</p>
<p>	Coinciding
roughly with the most western part of the Virginia-West Virginia
boundary, the eastern edge of the Mixed Mesophyte region forms a
broad ecotone on transition to the Oak-Chestnut forest type of the
Valley and Ridge. With the (let&rsquo;s
hope) temporary decline of the American
Chestnut, which once flourished on its dry ridges, the Oak-Chestnut
region is now characterized by the dominance of five oaks: Black,
Scarlet, Northern Red, White and Chestnut and on the driest sites, by
Virginia  (<i>Pinus  virginiana</i>),  Pitch, Shortleaf  (<i>Pinus </i>
<i>echinata</i>)  and Table Mountain  (<i>Pinus  pungens) </i> pines.
Other prominent species are White Pine  (<i>Pinus
 strobus</i>),  Black Gum, Black Birch  (<i>Betula  lenta</i>), 
Pignut Hickory  (<i>Carya </i> <i>glabra </i>) and Red Maple.
The understory tree layer is usually dominated
by Service Berry, Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus </i> <i>florida</i>) 
and White Pine and in the shrub and ground layers by Mountain Laurel,
Fetterbush (<i>Pieris floribunda </i>)<i>  </i>, 
huckleberries, blueberries, azaleas  (deciduous rhododendrons), 
Teaberry  (<i>Gaultheria</i><i> procumbens</i>
) and other acid loving plants. Slope
concavities may contain Tuliptree, White Ash, Cucumber Magnolia (<i>Magnolia  acuminata</i>),  Basswood and other mesic species.</p>
<p>	Some
authors  (e.g. Kuchler, 1966)  have split the Oak Chestnut region,
into &ldquo;Appalachian Oak Forest&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oak Hickory-Pine
Forest&rdquo; Types. Because I am
optimistic about the American Chestnut&rsquo;s eventual recovery from
the Chestnut blight (<i>Endothia parasitica</i>),
and because this species is a habitat indicator,
 Braun&rsquo;s (1950) terminology is retained here.</p>
<p>	Still
farther to the east a second ecotone marks the transition to the
Oak-Pine forest of the Piedmont. Since
the latter generally lies below 1000 feet (300 meters) asl, it
contains a number of species such as Loblolly Pine, Sweet Gum and
Southern Red oak which are not found at higher elevations.</p>
<p>	On
ascent to the highest elevations and northward into Maryland and
Pennsylvania southern species in the mixed mesophyte forest gradually
drop out, northern species such as Yellow Birch  (<i>Betula 
alleghaniensis</i>)  and Mountain Maple (<i>Acer</i><i>
spicatum</i>)
appear and Sugar Maple, American Beech, and Canadian Hemlock assume
dominance. American Basswood  (<i>Tilia 
americana</i>  var  <i>americana </i>) replaces White Basswood as
well. This is the Hemlock-White
Pine-Northern Hardwood forest of Braun (1950). It
has a distinctly northern quality in its shrubs and herbaceous flora
and may appear identical to forests of the Adirondack foothills or
New England. However this forest also
contains a strong Appalachian element in both trees and herbaceous
vegetation. Cucumber and Fraser Magnolia
 (<i>Magnolia  fraseri</i>)  and Black Locust are common and in some
places. Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron
maximum </i>) forms heavy understory thickets. In
addition to typical northern herbs such as Canada Mayflower
(<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>), the diversity is greatly enhanced by
striking plants such as Frasers Sedge (
<i>Cymophyllus fraseri</i> ),  with its elegant lily-like leaves, and
seed-heavy stalks of Mountain Bugbane  (<i>Cimicifuga americana</i>) 
which are endemics and missing from the northern forests.</p>
<p>	Above
3500 feet (1000 meters) asl in West Virginia and at lower elevations
in Maryland and Pennsylvania, the northern hardwoods yield gradually
to the Red Spruce  (<i>Picea  rubens</i>)  montane forest of boreal
appearance mentioned earlier. In this
forest circumpolar flowering plants such as Mountain Oxalis  (<i>Oxalis</i><i>
montana </i>) and
Goldthread  (<i>Coptis groenlandica</i> )    vie with lycopods,
liverworts and mosses in the ground cover, while shrubs are rare
because of dense shade. Southward this
forest type occurs only in a few isolated and climate-modified stands
as at Mountain Lake and Beartown (designated wildernesses) in the
Valley and Ridge and in the Balsam Range in the Mount Rogers National
Recreation Area of the Jefferson National Forest. At
Mountain Lake there is a small isolated stand of old growth
consisting of Red Spruce, Canadian Hemlock, Sugar and Red Maple,
Black and Yellow Birch, White Ash, Northern Red and White Oak, Black
Cherry, Cucumber Magnolia and Tuliptree. Mountain
Maple and Great Rhododendron form the understory and the ground cover
contains intergrowths of the boreal species Canada Mayflower (
<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>)  and the southern Appalachian Galax (
<i>Galax aphylla </i>), all at about 3600 ft. (1100 meters) asl.
In the Balsam Range this forest, which here is
almost restricted to elevations above 5000 ft. (1500 meters), assumes
the character of the Southern Spruce-Fir type with the accompaniment
of Red Spruce by Fraser Fir  (<i>Abies  fraseri</i>),  the Southern
Appalachian endemic. In this forest and
also at lower elevations of this range other Southern Appalachian
endemics such as Umbrella Leaf  (<i>Diphylleia cymosa</i>)  and a
number of interesting salamanders enter the picture. Even
the most northern appearing Central Appalachian Spruce forests, as on
West Virginia&rsquo;s Allegheny Plateau, contain an admixture of
southern Appalachian species such as Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana</i>)
and Southern Mountain Cranberry  (<i>Vaccinium erythrocarpum</i>) 
which are out of the range of boreal forests.</p>
<p>	In
the oak-chestnut type forests of the Valley and Ridge and Blue Ridge
Provinces the effects of elevation are more subtle, even cryptic.
This is due in part to the different species
segregates that result from lower precipitation and/or cloud cover
and continentality as compared with the Allegheny highlands.
Effects take the form of higher temperatures
and influence of the nearby ocean on day to day weather, which tends
to be somewhat erratic. In the vicinity
of latitude 38&#730;N Tuliptree generally is confined below 2500 ft.
(760 meters) and Chestnut Oak below 3500 ft. (1070 meters) asl.
In these mountains there is with few
exceptions, no spruce montane forest. Instead
&ldquo;orchard&rdquo; type Northern Red Oak stands with gnarled,
thick-trunked and widely spaced trees dominate the highest
elevations. On the most exposed peaks
trees are greatly stunted and directionally contorted by the wind.
Many show long, thick limbs growing at right
angles to the trunk as an adaptation to the weight of ice and wind
stress.<sup><a name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a></sup>
On elevations where rocky, acid soils or other
inhospitable conditions are intensified, there are &ldquo;barrens&rdquo;
of low heath shrubs, Sweet Fern  (<i>Comptonia</i><i>
peregrina</i> ) 
and Bear Oak  (<i>Quercus</i><i> ilicifolia</i>
).  These shrub expanses are punctuated
by taller wind-contorted (banner) Pitch and Table Mountain Pines, or
in some cases, shrubby Hemlock. Above
3500 ft. (1070 meters) asl low elevation
shrubs and herbaceous flora are replaced by such northerners as
Mountain Ash  (<i>Pyrus</i><i> americana</i>
), Mountain Maple, Yellow Clintonia  (<i>Clintonia</i><i>
borealis</i>), 
Canada Mayflower, etc. as in the Alleghenies. Perhaps
because of relatively high precipitation there, the northern Blue
Ridge is favored by a number of rare disjuncts. On
it are found Virginia&rsquo;s only known occurrences of Bearberry (
<i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i> )  and Balsam Fir  (<i>Abies balsamea</i>
), the latter its most southerly station on the Planet. It
is confined to the summit regions of Hawksbill and Stonyman Mountains
which barely extend to 4000 feet (1200 meters) in elevation and is a
minor component of oak forest. Consequently
it must have passed through a rather narrow thermal bottleneck during
the hypsithermal interval, a period of higher temperatures.</p>
<p>	It
is obvious that changes in vegetation with elevation is not solely
due to lapse rate. Certainly the
restriction of Tuliptree below 2500 ft. in the valley and ridge at
38&#730; N and its occurrence above 3000 feet (900 meters) at the
same latitude in cooler West Virginia requires another explanation.
The survival of seedlings frequently depends on
the interaction of temperature, soil and air moisture and light
intensity. Although the Valley and Ridge
and the Blue Ridge are less continental than the Appalachian Plateau,
their weather varies greatly from day to day. Warm
spells that activate buds are frequently followed by hard frosts and
frost heaving that damage buds and roots. When
the disrupted roots freeze again less moisture than otherwise reaches
the plant above ground. These conditions
are more prevalent in the Valley and Ridge and Blue Ridge than on the
Allegheny Plateau where there is more snow and cloud cover. 
</p>
<p>
</ul>
<h2>Unusual
Biologic Communities</h2>
<ul>
<p>	Within
the areas of the major Central Appalachian forest types there are
many smaller biologic communities with special characteristics.
Invariably these communities have resulted from
geologic, topographic or climatic conditions that are unique in their
details. Most widespread are the glades
or natural openings that result from such conditions as interrupted
drainage or bedrock-imposed moisture or drought conditions. In
terms of area the most common glades are the high-elevation bogs,
fens, swamps and other wetlands of the Allegheny Mountains and
Plateau. There are also many smaller
open or forested wetlands, usually associated with floodplain
topography, artesian springs, perched water tables or sinkholes.
Many of these communities, both large and
small, contain rare, frequently disjunct, species. An
example is the famous Cranberry Glade complex that covers 750 acres
(330 hectares) on West Virginia&rsquo;s Allegheny plateau.
Lying at 3400 ft (1040 meters) elevation, its
boreal type bogs fens, marshes and swamps are rich in acid soil
disjuncts such as Bog Rosemary  (<i>Andromeda</i><i>
glaucophylla</i>) 
and Small Cranberry  (<i>Vaccinium</i><i> oxycoccos</i>) as well as some with greater soil tolerance ranges such as Buckbean
 (<i>Menyanthes</i><i> trifoliata</i>), a circumpolar relative of gentians. Of similar nature, and the
largest wetland in the Central Appalachians, is the 7000 acre Canaan
Valley complex. At 3200 ft. elevation
and lying just north of the Monongahela National Forest, the Canaan
Valley is the site of a new national wildlife refuge.</p>
<p>	Some
of the smaller wetlands are also great centers of diversity.
An example occurs alongside Folly Mills stream
in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley. This
small wetland, at only 1580 ft (480 meters) asl, is home to an
impressive array of northern disjuncts as well as southern species,
many of which were first identified only a few decades ago and which
are still being inventoried. As in the
Cranberry Glades, Buckbean also occurs here, but in an almost
acid-neutral environment of a calcareous marsh and fen. Here
also are such indicators of this environment as Prairie Loosestrife (
<i>Lysimachia</i><i> quadriflora</i>) and Swamp Lousewort  (<i>Pedicularis</i><i> lanceolata</i>). Other northerners include Glaucous or
Pussy Willow  (<i>Salix discolor</i>),  in its only known Virginia
occurrence<sup><a name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a></sup>,
as well as a number of rare sedges<sup><a name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a></sup>.
Southern species which form a melange<sup><a name="sdfootnote4anc" href="#sdfootnote4sym"><sup>4</sup></a></sup>
with these northerners are Purple Gerardia  (<i>Gerardia</i><i>
purpurea</i>)  and
the rare Large-leaved Grass of Parnassus  (<i>Parnassia</i><i>
grandifolia</i>) 
which is a member of the saxifrage family. This
complex community owes its origin and continued existence to cool
artesian springs and location in a &ldquo;frost pocket&rdquo; by
virtue of air drainage from surrounding hills. These
factors have combined to provide a
refugium for species that we may infer were originally driven south
by the climatic conditions brought about by ice sheets to the north.
However, unlike northern type communities at
higher elevations, this refugium is confined to the wetland while the
surrounding hills are covered by Appalachian type oak-hickory forest
which contain such southerners as Post Oak and Persimmon but no
species of northern affinity.</p>
<p>	Sinkhole
ponds along the western edge of Virginia&rsquo;s Blue Ridge harbor
such rare disjuncts as White Buttons  (<i>Eriocaulon septangulare</i>), Eastern Tiger Salamander  (<i>Ambystoma</i><i> tigrinum
tigrinu </i>) and
Virginia Sneezeweed  (<i>Helenium</i><i> virginicum</i>). Other, even rarer, small ponds and
wetlands occur at various elevations, perhaps on perched water tables
and provide habitat for long isolated populations of salamanders and
other species. All are under threat of
poor management practices and roads that
expose them to Off Road Vehicles  (Mueller, 1991). </p>
<p>	Dry
cedar glades, limestone and shale barrens contain assemblages of
draught, cold and heat resistant plants and <i>animals</i>.
Some of the most outstanding examples occur in
West Virginia&rsquo;s Smoke Hole region in the Valley and Ridge
Province,  (Bartgis, 1993).  There
limestone barrens and cedar glades support a number of midwestern and
western species, some of which, like Prairie Flax (<i>Linum lewisii</i>) are disjunct from as far away as west of the Mississippi River and
the shore of the Hudson Bay. The floras
of the more common shale barrens have received considerable attention
in recent years and are known for rare species such as the federally
endangered Shale Barren Rock Cress  (<i>Arabis</i><i> serotina</i>)  (Wieboldt, 1991). </p>
<p>	Other
special habitats on exposed ridges and peaks, frequently on rocky
terrain, harbor montane and boreal plants such as Michaux&rsquo;s
Saxifrage  (<i>Saxifraga</i><i> michauxii</i>), Greenland Sandwort  (<i>Arenaria</i><i>
gr&oelig;nlandica</i>) and Three-toothed Cinquefoil  (<i>Potentilla</i><i>
tridentata</i>). 
However natural &ldquo;balds&rdquo; with
extensive grass and shrub communities in place of trees, such as
characterize high elevations in the Southern Appalachians, appear to
be very rare in the Central Appalachians  (Rentch and Fortney, 1997). There are numerous more limited
openings, exclusive of the previously described heath barrens and
which are more mesic in character than the latter. These
merge with the more widespread orchard type summit forests of
Northern Red Oak or in some cases Beech and Hawthorn  (Strausbaugh
and Core, 1977).  These may have ground
covers of grasses such as Mountain Oat Grass  (<i>Danthona</i><i>
compressa</i>), 
Hay-scented Fern, sedges and cushions of Haircap Moss  (<i>Polytrichum</i>).</p>
<p>	More
common than the conspicuously novel communities discussed above are
some that are merely unusual in the forest type in which they occur.
Frequently they involve only slight disjunction
of common or rare species in a setting of or in combination with the
dominant regional flora. Thus distinctly
northern species may occur in a mixed mesophyte forest with
dominantly southern species. An example
is the occurrence of northern herbs such as Wild Sarsaparilla (
<i>Aralia</i><i> nudicaulis</i>) and Millet Grass  (<i>Milium</i><i> effusum</i>) with Tuliptree and Black Walnut as in
the lower Back Creek drainage of Virginia&rsquo;s Valley and Ridge or
Canadian Yew  (<i>Taxus canadensis</i>)  and Mountain Maple at less
than 2500 ft. (760 meters) asl in certain steep sided NE facing
gorges that cut through Allegheny Mountain in West Virginia.</p>
<p>	From
the occurrences of melange communities a sequence of types is
distinguishable that may elucidate the so-called &ldquo;disharmonious&rdquo;
Pleistocene communities which they resemble and of which they may be
relict. According to MacArthur (1975) 
there is a positive correlation between increased species diversity
and decreased climatic variability as measured by winter-summer
differences in mean temperature. The
most striking case and end type of the identified sequence here is
the small isolated Folly Mills Wetland where the effects of seasonal
fluctuations in growing conditions are moderated by the artesian
springs and salubrious chemistry. Thus
although the surrounding forest, which is more subject to climatic
variations, is typically southern Appalachian, the wetland is a
melange of many northern and even Arctic species with other species
of wide as well as decidedly southern distributions.</p>
<p>	Next
in the sequence, with markedly less disjunction, and unlike the Folly
Mills wetland, not separated from the regional forest, is the
occurrence of northern mesic species such as <i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>
and Millet Grass in a southern Appalachian
mesic forest as the cited occurrence in the Back Creek drainage.</p>
<p>	Finally,
least remarkable but most common, is the occurrence of rare and
common northern species, some only slightly if at all disjunct, in
high elevation wetlands such as the Cranberry Glades or in the
surrounding forest with which the wetlands harmonize in climatic
type. However as pointed out earlier,
all Central Appalachian northern type communities also have
admixtures of southern Appalachian species.</p>
<p>
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Shade
Tolerance</h2>
<ul>
<p>Tolerance
of shade by forest trees, shrubs and herbs plays an important and
easily observable role in forest ecology. It
directly influences what species can grow in different forest
environments at various times of the year and stage of development.
It to a large extent determines how a forest
looks and its manifestations should be clearly observed by those who
would understand the forest.</p>
<p>	If
trees are tolerant of shade while young they are able to survive, at
least for a time, as seedlings and
saplings beneath the forest canopy. If
not, they can flourish only in openings. Some
trees are in fact quite tolerant while young but become increasingly
intolerant with age, certainly a useful adaptation. Of
course tree seedlings are opportunistic and when a mature tree falls
those already growing in the resultant opening respond to the
increased light by a growth spurt. Some
tree species never grow large and form a forest understory.
Such species &mdash; Flowering Dogwood,
Hophornbeam and Striped Maple are examples &mdash;&nbsp;are shade
tolerant by necessity, as are all shrubs
that grow in the forest. Some forest
herbs, those soft leaved annuals and perennials that far outnumber
trees in species diversity, are quite shade tolerant while many are
not. The most tolerant are ferns and
lycopods but many flowering plants form a vernal flora that must
flower and set seed before the trees leaf out. Comparatively
few are able to do this under summer&rsquo;s dense canopy.</p>
<p>	Due
to low shade tolerance many oak forests look remarkably different
from maple forests. Since oak seedlings&mdash;
with the exception of Northern Red Oak&mdash; tend to have low
tolerance, there will be few present in a mature oak forest of the
same species. On the other hand a maple
forest may have a heavy undergrowth of maple seedlings and saplings.
In the oak forest seedlings and saplings will
be confined to openings creating a patchiness different from that of
the maple forest. In addition a number
of other shade intolerant species will occupy these oak forest
openings creating a type of diversity less well developed in the
maple forest.</p>
<p>	Shade
tolerance also governs succession, or the change in species makeup
after a disturbance creates an opening. In
general shade tolerant species tend to
be more abundant in late as compared with early successional stages.
However the most complex forests, such as the
mixed mesophytic, have a diverse array of species with wide shade
tolerance ranges since disturbances are frequent enough to perpetuate
intolerant as well as tolerant species.</p>
<p>	In
the Central Appalachians the most shade tolerant species of trees are
those which characteristically occur in the medium moisture or mesic
regimes. They are Canadian Hemlock,
American Beech, Sugar and Black Maple, Red Spruce and Balsam Fir as
well as a number of small understory trees among which Flowering
Dogwood, Hop Hornbeam and Striped Maple are most common. The
Basswoods and Yellow Buckeye are also quite tolerant. Most
species of oaks are of intermediate tolerance. However
Scarlet Oak shows low tolerance of shade, as do Tuliptree, Black
Cherry, White Ash and most of the Birches. Shagbark
Hickory, a tree of rich mesic environments, is moderately tolerant
but other members of this genus as well as the related walnuts are
fairly intolerant. Some species, such as
White Pine and White Ash, are very tolerant when young but become
intolerant with age.</p>
<p>	Red
Maple, which is of intermediate tolerance, but more tolerant than any
oak, has a special role. It is at home
in habitats ranging from Southern Swamps to the dryest mountain
ridges and the fringes of the boreal forest. Because
conditions exclude the most tolerant species such as Beech and Sugar
Maple, it, along with Striped Maple, is frequently the most tolerant
species in xeric oak-chestnut forests of
the Central Appalachians. As a
consequence it has become a prime scapegoat and cover for a multitude
of silvicultural sins perpetrated by the U.S. Forest Service and
other industrial foresters.</p>
<p>	Despite
the great variation in shade tolerance among trees, virgin mixed
mesophyte forests have an abundance of species of all shade tolerance
levels. Thus Tuliptree and intolerant
oaks are major components of many stands although shade tolerant
species frequently dominate. In the dry
oak-chestnut forests intermediate and intolerant oaks (White,
Chestnut, Black, Red and Scarlet) dominate in stands undisturbed by
humans since the most tolerant species are excluded by soil and
climate. This fact is a source of
embarrassment to the Forest Service which steadfastly maintains that
the commercially desirable but intolerant oaks need the help of large
openings such as clearcuts to reproduce and prevent takeover by Red
Maple and other undesirable species. However
the prominent ecological forester Dr. Leon Minckler has repeatedly
made the point that large openings are not necessary for reproduction
 (e.g. Minckler, 1974).  It is becoming
increasingly clear that a major mechanism of forest reproduction in
mature deciduous forests is the formation of tree fall gaps which
allow sufficient light to encourage even the least tolerant species.</p>

<h2>Forest
Disturbance</h2>
<ul>
<p><h3>General</h3></p>
<ul>
<p>	At
every stage of development forests are subject to a variety of
natural disturbances that result in tree damage or death.
Usually dead trees fall after standing for
periods as &ldquo;snags.&rdquo; In many
cases healthy living trees are knocked down by winds, lightening or
the weight of snow and ice. They may
also be felled by Beavers. Trees may be
killed while standing by a great variety of insects or pathogens such
as fungi or by fire.</p>
<p>	Disturbances
may be regarded as divided into two types. The
most prevalent type may be called background disturbances.
This includes the tree damage and mortality of
a single or small group of trees without the intervention of large
scale insect, storm, fire or other disturbances that affect many
trees at a time. It should be remembered
that more than 99 percent of all trees in a healthy maturing forest
must die to make room for the survivors. The
trees that die are usually the weakest and are subject to insects and
disease that do not affect stronger trees or they may be uprooted due
to weak root systems. On this background
of normal tree death are superimposed the large episodes of
disturbance due to hurricanes, tornadoes,
large fires and widespread insect and disease outbreaks.</p>

<p>	In
addition to these specific organisms of disturbance there has in
recent years emerged a sort of catch-all and vague concept of &ldquo;oak
decline&rdquo; and this has been stressed by timber interests,
including agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, as justification
for cutting trees. Oak decline is said
to be characterized by symptoms such as chlorosis, limb die-back and
epicormic branching, mostly in the Red Oak group. Forest
Service experts have yet to find a solid explanation for the
condition but are forced to fall back on a broad spectrum of insects
and diseases triggered by such factors as drought and poor site
quality  (Starkey et al, 1989).  It is
said to be quite prevalent in the Southern Appalachians where Zahner
 (1992)  proposed &ldquo;benign neglect&rdquo; as a proper curative
agent. He attributed many of the
symptoms to normal senescence of comparatively short-lived species
such as Scarlet and Black Oak in the process of replacement by
longer-lived Chestnut and White Oak. Certainly
there is little attempt by the public agencies to look for causes of
oak decline in past management practices which have brought about
pervasive and extensive changes in soils, moisture regimes and even
forest type over wide areas. As Lucy
Braun recognized long ago, many rich mixed mesophyte forests have
been degraded to depauperate and Xeric oak-pine stands that consist
mostly of the short lived species referred to by Zahner. Thus
oak decline may actually be a manifestation of a healing process of
reversion to a more complex forest type in the normal succession from
simple, excessively oak-rich stands that have resulted from human
activities. We shall see that in many
areas where the Forest Service has identified Oak decline in the
Central Appalachians they have used a heavy dose of imagination and
have failed to distinguish it from normal limb shedding and mortality
in a healthy forest.</p>
<p>	Background
disturbance gives rise to much of the structural diversity of Central
Appalachian forests as especially well developed in old growth
stands. Windthrow and defoliation create
gaps in the canopy which allow opportunistic light demanding as well
as shade tolerant species to spring up. This
increased diversity is further accomplished by the pit and mound
structures created by tree falls and associated uprooting.
These structures not only bare mineral soils
obligatory for certain plants, but create breeding and feeding
habitats for arthropods and amphibians in the pits. 
</p>
<p>	Runkle (1996)  has pointed out that the formation of  small tree-fall gaps by
windthrow or otherwise probably is dominant in the creation of forest
openings in the Central Appalachians.</p>
<p>
</p>
</ul>
<p><b>Wind,
Ice and Snow</b></p>
<ul>
<p>	Perhaps
the largest natural disturbances in the Central Appalachians result
from hurricanes which from time to time cross into the mountains.
In such events thousands of acres may be
affected in the most vulnerable topography. An
example is Hurricane Hugo which entered the Valley and Ridge in
September,1989. In
some cases serious landslides accompany hurricanes as a result of
heavy rainfall. These landslides are
particularly extensive on the east side of the Blue Ridge as in the
case of Hurricane Camille in 1969  (Kochel and Simmons, 1986). 
Smaller, but still extensive areas
of tree breakage and uprooting occurs from local thunderstorms and
tornadoes. However
extensive blowdowns are not as common as in the boreal forest where
generally more subdued terrain permits
greater wind sweep and trees which are predominantly conifers are not
as wind firm.</p>
<p>	Many
parts of the Central Appalachians,
particularly at high elevations, are subject to severe ice and snow
damage. Ice from glaze storms is most
common and when the wind blows many limbs come down. Snow
damage tends to be confined to evergreens and to deciduous trees in
fall when early snow loads trees still in leaf. The
sometimes bizarre tree forms that result have already been alluded
to.</p>
<p>
</p>
</ul>
<p><b>Role
of Fire</b></p>
<ul>
<p>	Next
to tree fall gaps, usually formed by windthrow, fire was probably
most responsible for natural forest openings. Abrams  (1992),  in
particular, has stressed the role of fire in the maintenance of  oak
forests. While the role of fire in the
Central Appalachians is still poorly understood, extensive
observations by Virginians For Wilderness have revealed a number of
interesting effects of this agent. Quite
obviously fire was most common in the dry oak-chestnut and oak-pine
uplands before human suppression became routine. However,
many trees in moist coves also show fire scars. This
is probably a consequence of the relatively thin bark of many cove
species such as Shagbark Hickory, Beech, Tuliptree, etc. as compared
with thick-barked Chestnut Oak for example. Although
the virgin high elevation spruce forests of the Allegheny Plateau
presumably had substantial fire potential, it appears that the
prevailing high moisture levels prevented many fires until logging
and land clearing produced incendiary slashings and ignition sparks.</p>
<p>	In
addition to charred wood, evidence for forest fires frequently takes
the form of inverted U-shaped basal trunk scars or cavities.
These scars are usually confined to a single
(lee?) side of trees for any given fire. Other
evidence is the nature of sprout clumps in which the sprouts of
individual clumps are widely spaced. This spacing indicates that,
unlike sprouts that follow logging, fires tend to kill the lower
parts of trees so that sprouting is from surrounding roots.
Where such sprouting occurs, it points to high
fire frequencies in the past since trees in excess of 100 years of
age seldom sprout much. Such evidence
has a bearing on the identification of primary and old growth stands.
However, contrary to some opinions, fires set
by indigenous Americans or otherwise were not required to protect
many Appalachian oak forests from invasion by more shade tolerant
species, a point already made in the section on shade tolerance.</p>
<p>	Although
oaks are fairly resistant to fire &mdash; and this applies
particularly to Chestnut Oak with its thick bark ridges &mdash; they
are not as all-around fire adapted as Shortleaf, Pitch and Table
Mountain Pines. Examination of these
pines reveals multi-layered and hence highly insulated bark.
Consequently, although oaks in a burn area may
show fire scaring and even high mortality, coexisting Pitch and Table
Mountain Pine show only blackened lower trunks with no visible damage
to living tissues.<sup><a name="sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym"><sup>5</sup></a></sup>
As a result of this fire resistance pine may be
the oldest and largest trees on some dry sites. Also,
since they have serotinous cones, and in the case of Pitch and
Shortleaf Pines, sprouting ability, they are ever ready to renew
themselves should an intense fire occur. By
contrast White Pine is not nearly as fire adapted.<sup><a name="sdfootnote6anc" href="#sdfootnote6sym"><sup>6</sup></a></sup></p>
<p>
</p>
</ul>
<p><b>Insects</b></p>
<ul>
<p>	In
recent years the Gypsy Moth has had the most visible effect on
certain Central Appalachian Forests. Because
of its fondness for Oak leaves this defoliator has made its greatest
impact on the Valley and Ridge province where these trees dominate.
Usually two successive defoliations are enough
to kill a tree. Furthermore, although
the Moth larv&aelig; finish feeding in early or mid summer and the
trees then attempt to grow new leaves,
this depletes the supply of energy to the extent that, unlike
Chestnut Blight-Killed trees, these trees retain no power to sprout.
Since the Gypsy Moth is an alien species, it
has few effective native predators. However
several pathogens, a fungus and a bacterium, have been introduced and
are quite effective. In particular, the fungus <i>Entomophaga </i>
<i>maimaiga</i>, originally imported from Japan in 1910, brought
about a collapse of Gypsy Moth populations over large areas,
including parts of the Central Appalachians, in 1996  (Hajek, 1996;
Schneeberger,1996; also see
&lt;www.nysaes.cornell.edu/ent/biocontrol/pathogens/e_maimaig_&gt;). 
These pathogens, in concert with native birds,
insect predators and other factors generally bring about population
crashes after two or three seasons of severe defoliation.
Because conditions vary so widely it is
difficult to predict the number of years between population peaks.</p>
<p>	While
the Gypsy Moth kills many trees and damages many more,
its effect is not all negative on our forests. The
open canopy that results from
defoliation and tree death allows saplings and many other species on
the forest floor to grow vigorously into lush undergrowth, although
the acorn crop on which some wildlife depends may be greatly reduced.
Also many birds and animals benefit greatly
from the abundant wood boring larv&aelig; made available and
salamanders and other small animals flourish in the cool earth
beneath the fallen tree trunks. At the
same time these trunks, lying in every
direction, provide excellent cover for large animals such as Bobcats
and Black Bears. Indeed the Gypsy Moth
attacked forest acquires many of the
desired features of old growth. Not
least is the winnowing effect of the Moth in eliminating the most
susceptible trees, thereby strengthening
the genetic stock of the forest.</p>
<p>	Although
the Gypsy Moth is having a substantial effect on forest ecology, the
Hemlock Woody Adeligid, also an alien species, may ultimately have a
far greater impact. Unlike the Moth this Adelgid does not spread
rapidly since its flying forms require spruce species as hosts that
are not present in the region. Also its
immature forms do not have the capability of &ldquo;ballooning&rdquo;
or blowing away on silk strands, that Gypsy Moth larv&aelig; have.
Consequently it is spread mainly through
transport of its eggs and nymph stages by birds and the wind spread
of tree fragments to which it adheres. Reviews of the life cycle of
this Adelgid are widely available on the internet.</p>
<p>	The
distribution of the Hemlock Woolly
Adelgid is very spotty and irregular. It
is widespread in Shenandoah National Park and along the Blue Ridge
generally where it has devastated old growth Hemlock. In
the Valley and Ridge it has devastated Hemlock in certain stream
valleys such as Ramsey's Draft, a designated Wilderness Area, but
appears to colonize ridges above 3000 feet  (915 m)  asl more slowly.
Unlike the Gypsy Moth, which does not kill many
of the trees it defoliates, the Hemlock Woolly
Adelgid appears to be far more lethal. This
lethality results at least in part from the low capability of
conifers to store energy in their roots and the lack of a true
dormant period in them. It is likely
that the Hemlock Adelgid will result in the extirpation of this grand
conifer in many rich cove areas with subsequent replacement by oaks,
maples and Tuliptree. This would not
however be the first time this species suffered serious decline.
Pollen data indicate that some pathogen or
insect brought about a population crash in Hemlock over wide areas of
eastern North America about 4800 years ago  (Davis, 1981).</p>
<p>	Compared
to the Gypsy Moth and the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid
the effects of the Southern Pine Beetle and the Black Turpentine
Beetle in the Central Appalachians are relatively minor. Since
they are natives, extirpation of the host species is not likely to
occur. Generally confined to the
Piedmont and Coastal Plain, intrusion of the beetles into the
mountains is confined to a run of mild winters such as occurred in
the late 1880s and early 1990s, but in 1994 was halted by a cold
winter. Whereas the Gypsy Moth and the
Hemlock Woolly Adelgid attack foliage,
these beetles riddle the bark, destroying the cambium, and this kills
quickly. Fungus and wood borer attacks
quickly follow and destroy the wood on a massive scale.
Attacks are usually concentrated in the Yellow
Pine group  (Virginia, Pitch, Shortleaf)  but may also occur in White
Pine if infestations are severe. The
Black Turpentine Beetle concentrates on the lower trunk while the
Southern Pine Beetle attacks the middle and upper trunks.
Since pines are a minor component in Central
Appalachian forests and are native, there are probably no negative
long term impacts and they conceivably benefit the ecosystem through
habitat enhancement by the dead wood produced. However
short term economic loss may be severe in pine plantations.</p>
<p>
</p>
</ul>
<p><b>Forest
Pathogens</b></p>
<ul>
<p>	Many
diseases affect trees during their normal course of development and
these play a major role in background disturbance. Some
diseases achieve enough prominence to
greatly disturb the forest. The most
familiar example is the fungus that produced American Chestnut Blight
and which had its origin in Eurasia. There
it coevolved with the native chestnuts which consequently developed
resistance to it. By the 1930s Chestnut
Blight had swept through eastern North American deciduous forests and
most American Chestnut trees were dead. However
the smaller shrub-like Chinquapin  (<i>Castanea pumila</i>)  was
little affected.</p>
<p>	When
attacked by the Chestnut Blight the American Chestnut suffers limb
death and finally the entire trunk above ground dies. As
a consequence there is no possibility of refoliation but the roots
live on and their energy and nutrient supplies are retained as is
their ability to sprout. Furthermore
this sprouting ability appears to be retained for years or
indefinitely. Thus even today, more than
60 years after the original infection, some trees continue to sprout
and occasionally even set fruit. But
these fruits seldom contain viable seeds because the trees are now
too far apart for mutual fertilization. Some
of the sprouts attain heights of 40 feet and 8 inch diameters.
Virtually all die off eventually but leave
healthy roots behind to sprout again. There
is still a possibility that a weakened strain of the virus may take
over and that the small amount of viable seed produced will yield a
resistant strain of Wild American Chestnut. Let&rsquo;s
hope it does!</p>
<p>	Today
the sprouts of the American Chestnut are encountered almost
everywhere in the Central Appalachians. They
are most abundant on moderate mountain slopes where the Oak-Chestnut
forest type is best developed but are also common on exposed ridges.
They are less common in rich coves and in the
mixed mesophyte and northern hardwood forest types. A
broad survey of West Virginia forests, including many virgin tracts,
by Brooks (1910) indicates that at the time of settlement by
Europeans, American Chestnut was an ever
present but seldom major component in the dominantly mesophytic
forests of that state. This
is in agreement with the survey of Braun  (1950)  of mixed mesophyte
forests of the Cumberland Mountains and Plateau. In
addition to the sprouts which probably originated mostly from
immature trees, there are still many large Chestnut trunks and large
limbs on the ground. The largest
Chestnut remains preserved due to the tree&rsquo;s extraordinary
resistance to decay, are to be found in cove areas where the trees
grow to largest size.</p>
<p>	No
attempt will be made to discuss in detail the many pathogens which
are active in Central Appalachian forests and which play such an
important role in maintaining as well as challenging forest health.
As indicated in our tabulation other pathogens
of some importance are Dutch Elm disease
and Beech Blight. Dutch Elm disease is
of rather minor importance in the Central Appalachians since it
primarily affects American Elm  (<i>Ulmus americana</i>),  a tree
almost confined to river bottomlands at lower elevations. Its
effect on Slippery Elm  (<i>U. rubra</i>),  the most common member of
the genus in the region, appears to be minimal and in most areas
nonexistent. Also Beech Blight has so
far apparently had little impact in the region and appears to be
concentrated in the northern Appalachians. However
this pathogen may pose a greater challenge to the region&rsquo;s
forests in the future.</p>
<p>
</p>
</ul></ul>
<p> <h2>Human
Disturbance</h2> </p>
<ul>
<p>	Human
disturbance of the forest is so pervasive and complex that it cannot
be adequately discussed here, however, a partial treatment has been
provided elsewhere on this web site  (Central Appalachian Forests, a
Guide for Activists,  Mueller, 1994). </p>
<p>
</p>
</ul>
<p><h2>Glaciers
and Forest Migration</h2></p>
<ul>
<p>	The
largest disturbances to which the Appalachians forests were subjected
are the ice-age and post ice-age forest migrations. These
migrations are part of the diverse phenomena related to the proximity
of the ice and its withdrawal. Temperature
variations were important as were air mass movements such as
particularly the descending dry winds that blew off the ice caps.
Pollen data  (Delcourt and Delcourt, 1981)
indicate that around the glacial maximum a boreal Jack Pine -spruce
parkland (as distinguished from a closed canopy forest) extended as
far south as Tennessee and tundra probably occupied the highest
Appalachian elevations. At that time the
current deciduous forest of these mountains lay far to the south
along the Gulf and lower Atlantic coastal plains with the mixed
mesophytic component probably confined to dissected major river
system blufflands. However, even as the
ice sheet reached its points of greatest advance, a warming trend had
already set in. When the temperature
reached a maximum (the hypsithermal interval) some 7000 years ago,
existing forest types were temporarily displaced northward perhaps
200 miles (300 km.) and to several hundred meters higher elevations.
Furthermore similar displacements of this type
probably occurred a number of times in the last 10,000 years (
Pielou, 1991). Thus there emerges a
picture of a geographically dynamic forest that was able to migrate
hundreds of miles and reconstitute itself on a time scale of several
thousand years or less.</p>
<p>	Associated
with the great forest migrations after the glacial maximum, there, in
all probability, were corresponding changes in soil types.
Evidence comes from a number of studies in
glaciated regions in which all soil changes occurred less than ten
thousand years ago  (Armson, 1979) .  The
speed with which such changes can occur was illustrated by Langmaid (
1964)  who showed that earthworms could obliterate upper horizons of
podzol in as little as three years. Also
in their studies of soils in a forest-prairie ecotone in Minnesota
Severson and Arnemann (1973)  found that transformation of mesic
deciduous to pine-hardwood forest was accompanied by alterations of
the soil profile to one meter depth in less than 2000 years.
These results lead one to believe that soil
adjustments could easily have kept pace with changes in vegetation
type in the Central Appalachians during the last eighteen thousand
years.</p>
<p>
</p>
</ul>
<p><h2>Forest
Succession and Secular Change</b></h2>
<ul>
<p>	The
result of natural and human-induced disturbances is succession, the
progressive change of biological habitat from one occupied by
pioneering species to some form of &ldquo;climax&rdquo; community.
In forests this progression is usually from
shade intolerant to tolerant species since many intolerant species
are adapted to the high light intensity and degraded soils of forest
openings. However many tolerant species
also do well in openings, especially if they originate from sprouts,
or if, like Red Maple, are adapted to harsh conditions. It
was once rather naively thought that eastern North American deciduous
forests inevitable progressed toward a Beech-Maple climax, an idea
that gained credence chiefly in the Northeast where this climax is
common because of the climate and limited species richness (and where
many foresters lived). However it was
subsequently learned that the climax community of the mixed mesophyte
forest includes many common intolerant species. Also,
as stressed by Lucy Braun, some major forest types, such as
Oak-Chestnut, may at times be what is sometimes referred to as
<i>physiographic</i> climaxes  (see our later critque of designating
different types of climax)  consisting of shade intolerant species
such as oaks and pines.  In all these
eastern forest types, treefalls, fires and blowdowns and other
disturbances are frequent enough to perpetuate intolerant species.</p>
<p>	The
nature of succession is quite different in deciduous and in
coniferous forests. It also differs
markedly in naturally disturbed forests and those disturbed by
humans. Deciduous forests have the
capacity to resprout from stumps and roots as long as these survive
the disturbance. Coniferous forests,
with the rare exception of certain species such as Pitch Pine, have
little or no sprouting capacity. If
forest floors of deciduous forests are not disturbed too much
succession may be short circuited with simple seeding and resprouting
of the original trees and survival of understory and herbaceous
species. Most animals such as
arthropods, amphibians, and mammals may also survive or rapidly
recover from such light disturbances. In
such cases incursions by early successional direct sunlight-dependent
species may be very limited. However
where the forest floor has been greatly disturbed succession may not
only be set to zero or bare soil but fail to attain advanced stages
for hundreds or even thousands of years. Documentation
of the extremely long recovery time for herbaceous forest interior
vegetation after logging has been provided
by Duffy and Meier  (1992)  who have shown that it may be hundreds of
years for certain species. Analogous
studies of salamanders by Petranka <i>et al </i> (1993)  also
demonstrated long recovery times. Raymond
and Hardy   (1991)  showed that mole salamander populations even in
uncut forests adjacent to clearcuts were greatly affected by these
cuts.</p>
<p>	When
coniferous forests are disturbed, the response is quite different
from deciduous forests. Because felled
or killed standing conifers don&rsquo;t sprout, a conifer forest can
be propagated only by the seeds, seedlings and saplings which may be
present at the time of disturbance. Usually
there are few of either seedlings or saplings since they tend to die
off in the dense shade. When they are
present seedlings are apt to be so small that they are easily
overtopped by deciduous trees once openings are made. Although
the latter may not originally be present, they find rapid access to
cleared coniferous forests since many, such as aspens and maples,
have wind transported seeds, or like cherries, have fruits spread by
birds. The best examples of this
response of coniferous forests in the Central Appalachians occur in
the high elevation spruce belt of the Allegheny Mountains and Plateau
of West Virginia. Here a relatively
undisturbed Red Spruce forest had existed for at least hundreds of
years before the advent of European settlers. Because
of high moisture values this forest escaped severe fires.
Apparently also large blowdowns were
infrequent. However due to logging,
which extended from the late 1800s to the 1960s, some parts of this
belt suffered extensive and very hot fires which were set in slash by
sparks from engines used in these operations. Even
where fires did not occur, spruce was
rapidly replaced by a variety of deciduous trees and shrubs after
logging. The trees of the forest which
came in after the spruce was cut were mainly northern hardwoods such
as Yellow Birch, Sugar Maple, Beech, Fire Cherry  (<i>Prunus
pensylvanica</i>),  Aspens  (<i>Populus tremuloides</i> and <i>P</i><i>.
Grandidentata</i>
) as well as other rapidly growing species brought in by wind and
birds. Where fires had burned hot even
the deep organic soils of the spruce forest were burned away.
In such cases, as at Dolly Sods just west of
the Allegheny Front in Tucker County, West Virginia, the higher water
table that resulted from tree loss brought about acidification and
extensive heath barrens populated by blueberries, huckleberries and
even cranberries and sphagnum moss. In
some places bog species occur even on quite steep slopes. The
acidification in water saturated soils results from the lack of
capillary action in them so that bases such as Calcium Carbonate are
not brought up from below. The
replacement of spruce by hardwoods had been extensive during the
early part of this century. This is well
shown by comparison of a map presented by Brooks  (1910)  with
Landsat satellite photographs of the same area.</p>
<p>	Although
Red Spruce forest in the Alleghenies was in many ways replaced by
northern hardwoods, slow reoccupation by spruce seedlings as
understory in the hardwoods is occurring. This
is possible because some species such as birch do not cast dense
shade and because the spruce is very tolerant.</p>
<p>	When
a forest is disturbed by natural forces there is seldom much damage
to the forest floor and unlike human disturbances, which are usually
linked to the outside by roads, natural disturbances tend to be more
isolated. Thus they are less subject to
incursions by alien species in their early successional stages when
they are most vulnerable to these. In
Central Appalachian deciduous forests newly disturbed areas are
likely to be populated by many species of the Aster family, by Poke (
<i>Phytolacca americana</i>)  and other native herbs. In
the case of acidic oak forests these will be followed by a
flourishing of various heath shrubs that may have been present in the
original forest. These herbs and shrubs
will be accompanied by vigorous growth of sprouts and seedlings of
forest trees as well as opportunistic trees seeded from the outside
by wind or birds. Early succession in a
disturbed coniferous forest may be similar, except that there may be
few conifer seedlings present and many herbs will be discouraged by
acid conditions. In this case heath
barrens may result as previously described in the case of Dolly Sods.</p>
<p>	There
is a fundamental difference also in forest succession which results
from direct physical disturbance such as wind, fire or insect attack
and that which is a consequence of secular temperature or moisture
change such as characterized the glacial advance and retreat.
In the latter case some species gradually die
off and are replaced by others, perhaps without the intervention of
true early successional stages. This is
analogous to what occurs in late stages of normal succession when
mature intolerant species such as certain oaks are replaced by more
tolerant species such as maples.</p>
<p>	Secular
changes in forest type may be &mdash;&nbsp;and probably are&mdash;
underway in the Central Appalachians. A
possible instance may be the development of Red Spruce understory in
old growth or mature upland oak-rich forest as in the Fanny Bennett
Hemlock Reserve in the Monongahela National Forest  (see <a href=fannier.htm>our section
on this forest</a>)  where it cannot be easily attributed to recovery
from human induced episodes of deforestation and fire. However
this instance may reflect recent fire control measures and so
represent a shift of equilibrium under a modified disturbance regime.
An alternative explanation is that such
expansions of the spruce forest reflect a recent change to cooler and
moister conditions. A somewhat similar
case of Red Spruce invasion of oak forest occurs in the Shenandoah
Range of the Valley and Ridge. The
source of the invading spruce is a rare primary stand consisting of
mature Red Spruce, White, Black and Northern Red Oak, Yellow Birch,
Red Maple and Hemlock with and understory of Great Rhododendron and
Mountain Holly  (<i>Ilex montana</i>).  This forest occurs at about
3600 ft. asl. with a southeast aspect in
a springy area known as Hall Spring  (see <a href=hall.htm>our section on this forest</a>). It is the only substantial spruce
forest in this relatively dry range. The
surrounding dominantly Northern Red Oak forest is being invaded by
seedlings of Red Spruce from the primary stand. However
the Red Oak forest is in this case secondary and the spruce
understory may result from fire suppression.</p>
<p>	Many
transformations such as those involving changes in soil and forest
type as discussed earlier appear to be far more rapid than secular
genetic adjustments since the end of the glacial period or even the
earlier glacial maximum. Soil change
depends on favorable kinetics of chemical and micro-organic reactions
embodied in organisms such as fungi, bacteria and earthworms while
transformations of forest type depends largely on seed dispersal and
suitable soil development. In contrast,
genetic change results from selection pressures acting on successive
generations and usually many generations must elapse for marked
change to occur. Thus genetic inertia
tends to perpetuate Pleistocene characters in the flora and probably
in the fauna as well. An example of this
may be the persistence of conspicuously thorned trees such as
Hawthorns  (<i>Crat&aelig;gus</i>),  Honey Locust  (<i>Gleditsia
tricanthos</i> (, native crabapple  (e.g. Pyrus coronaria)  and other
thorned species. Add to this the
persistence of certain fruits such as that of Osage Orange   (Maclura
pomifera).  The fruit is a large, hard
syncarp that is consumed by few animals but horses. While
osage orange is native to the South-central
US rather than the Central Appalachians it has been widely planted
and escaped here.</p>
<p>	It
is likely that the large thorns and fruits of the cited trees were
originally defense from and food for the greater browsing megafauna
that ranged eastern North America during the Pleistocene  (Mueller,
1990).  This conclusion is supported by
the fact that since the demise of the megafauna the only significant
browser of eastern North America, where the most species of thorned
trees occur, has since megafaunal times been the White-tailed
Deer. Other large ungulates such as
Bison (<i>Bison bison</i>) and the Elk  (<i>Cervus canadensis</i>) 
which were also native to the region are essentially grazers.</p>
<p>	The
White-tailed Deer experiences little
difficulty browsing between the large thorns such as those of the
hawthorns or Honeylocust. On the other
hand, the megafauna, the Ground Sloths, Mastodonts
and other large browsers (Guilday, 1984) would have had great
difficulty with the thorns. In addition
the &ldquo;monkeypuzzles&rdquo; of large branching thorns which grow
from the trunks of thorned trees, in combination with the widely
spreading branches characteristic of these trees, would have also
thwarted any Mastodont attempting to
strip bark from the lower trunk.</p>
<p>	The
genetic inertia which perpetuates such structures as thorns for long
after the selection agent has vanished can be explained in some
species of hawthorns. These trees are
known to seed by <i>apomixis</i> or the production of seeds without
fertilization, which is analogous to cloning. For
such plants the genetic variation required to adjust to new
conditions is more limited than for species which utilize cross
fertilization.</p>
<p>	Among
the conspicuously thorned trees the hawthorns are most widespread in
the Central Appalachians. Unlike the
Honey Locust, which is almost confined to rich bottomlands, one or
the other of the many hawthorn species is found in virtually
every mountain habitat. Although
characteristically trees of openings, hawthorns frequently appear in
the understory of mature deciduous forests if these forests are not
too acidic. Others are found on the most
exposed mountain peaks among summit rocks. One
species, the Dotted Thorn  (<i>Crat&aelig;gus punctata</i>)  is the
characteristic species in the high elevation glades and among the
spruce groves of the Allegheny Mountains.</p>
<p>	The
lesson here is that the Central Appalachian forest appears to contain
living artifacts of the past. The full
extent of this phenomenon and its significance can only be guessed.
Artifacts which are visible, such as thorns or
fruit, may presage a multitude which are not so obvious. Many
of the characters yet to be recognized may be chemical. If
thorns were required to repel Mastodonts
then why not toxins, which like thorns have outlived their intended
victims but are still part of the living
forest?</p>

<p><h2>Forest
Stability and Equilibrium</h2></p>
<ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>	Discussions
of forest equilibrium are generally confined to presumed climax
stands. However, the writer  (Mueller, 2000 and above)  has
postulated that the concept may be generalized to include fundamental
stability relations between vegetation, substrate, climate and other
environmental factors at any stage of development or succession. In
this stability field analysis plant species are regarded as occupying
stability fields or volumes in multicomponental space  (hyperspace) 
and communities are regarded as consisting of overlapping fields of
the component species in this space. This system is based on an
analogy with mineral-or quite generally with chemical-systems.
Although these chemical system relations are thermodynamic in nature,
and biologic systems are far too complex for this, the latter
nontheless have their foundation in energetics as well.</p>
<p>	An
important practical point here is the function of stable communities
as reference states in the study of forest succession and change in
general. For example it is virtually meaningless to draw conclusions
about succession from the absence of certain species in either
undisturbed or disturbed forest without knowledge of the stability
relations of these species. For example, the restricted occurrence of
certain species may be related to the scarcity of the proper
microhabitats rather than any successional stage. Even a cursory
survey of the literature shows that these factors are seldom taken
into account in the many studies of forest succession currently
undertaken.</p>
<p>	Usually
climax forests  are regarded as being in equilibrium unless there is
evidence of instability. Braun (1950)
discussed some criteria for forest equilibrium (climax). Those
mentioned are (1) accordance of canopy and understory, (2) tendency
of the same climax to develop as the result of unlike succession, (3)
the occupation of topographically mature sites, (4) equilibrium
between soil and occupying vegetation and (5) climax similarity over
a large area. Of these point (3) is
clearly in error since a climax may be developed on topography as new
as glacial moraines. Also point (1)
needs qualification. First reproduction
in areas in which the canopy has been opened up may temporarily be
quite different from the overstory. Also
in some cases concordance is neither necessary (Chestnut Oak
seedlings under Chestnut Oak canopy) nor sufficient (aspen sprouts
under aspen) to establish equilibrium. However
in the case of tolerant seedlings and saplings under mature trees of
the same species as evidence may be compelling. In
general however Braun&rsquo;s ideas are in agreement with the
definition of dynamic equilibrium.</p>
<p>	The
data of Delcourt and Delcourt (1993) suggest that biotic responses
have approached dynamic equilibrium in the Central Appalachians
beginning about 8000 years before present for cool temperate
deciduous forests but that the mixed conifer-northern hardwoods north
of 44&deg; N latitude have not attained this state even today.
Of course this conclusion addresses a more or
less crude equilibrium that ignores minor forest migrations
associated with temperature fluctuations, particularly around 7000
years ago. If this conclusion of broad
equilibrium on a geographic scale is adopted, it follows that
elevational zoning is also evidence of equilibrium since it
recapitulates, with modifications, the latitudinal zonation.
As previously indicated, where disturbances
(primarily anthropogenic) have intruded, as in the Allegheny spruce
forests, the tendency is for the forest to return to the equilibrium
type. These conclusions are in general
agreement with Braun&rsquo;s criteria 2,4 and 5 as well as the
general concept of equilibrium.</p>
<p>	It should
be mentioned that the large scale equilibrium exemplified by forest
climax as discussed above is merely a manifestation of the same
energetic factors at work on a microhabitat scale as proposed in our
stability field analysis and which applies to the flora of any stage
of succession.

</p>
</ul>
<p><h2>Old
Growth</h2></p>
<ul>
<p>	Old
growth is the touchstone of ecological forestry. Foresters
who fail to recognize its importance can
only claim to be industrial woodcutters. Zahner
(1989) gave the following simple definition: &ldquo;Old
Growth forests are forests having a long uninterrupted period of
development.&rdquo; Note that this
definition says nothing about the ages of individual trees but does
say a great deal about their habitat. This
definition fits the Central Appalachians well because, while easily
identifiable old growth with obviously old, large trees, is scarce,
there are many stands seemingly undisturbed by humans, that may
qualify despite a scarcity of old trees. In
many forest types &mdash; cove, mixed mesophyte, northern hardwood,
spruce montane as well as many dry oak forests there are large old
trees and many are still being discovered. One
such stand was recently found in cutting unit one of the Stillhouse
Timber Sale on Shenandoah Mountain, a
fact that the George Washington National Forest had attempted to
conceal. However in the dryest
oak-chestnut and oak-pine forests on inaccessible ridges we find
ambiguity. Many such areas had burned
frequently in the past. Thus although,
except for the loss of chestnut, such stands may be primary and even
virgin forests, they may contain few old trees and so are difficult
to distinguish from stands disturbed by humans.</p>
<p>	The
ages of tree species have considerable significance with respect to
their classification by industrial foresters. For
example, the US Forest Service regularly twists normal tree mortality
data to justify timber sales. They
attempt to conceal that, as a healthy forest matures, most, indeed
more than 99 percent, of its trees must die before it reaches
maturity, to say nothing of old growth. And
this mortality is entirely independent of species longevity.
Most of this mortality occurs while the forest
is still young. Industrial foresters
would have us believe that 80-90 year old stands are &ldquo;decadent,&rdquo;
&ldquo;overmature&rdquo; or &ldquo;falling apart&rdquo; because they
contain dead trees. In this distortion
they ignore their own literature (e.g. Fowells, 1965) which gives the
following commonly attained ages for eastern forest trees:
White Oak 600 years, Northern Red Oak 200-300
years, Black Oak 200 years, Sugar Maple 400 years, American Beech
more than 360 years, White Pine 450 years and Canadian Hemlock 900
years. These data show that survivors in
a healthy maturing forest have the capability of attaining far
greater ages and larger sizes than those classified as mature by
industrial foresters.</p>
<p>	The
greatest significance of old growth lies in the now-rare habitat
niches it contains. Features such as
large standing (frequently hollow) snags, abundant large woody
debris, stream debris dams, pit and mound topography and canopy gaps
that result from large tree falls are some of the criteria for old
growth. Edaphic megapores, large
elongated openings in soils due to root decay or burrowing by
animals, have been stressed by Martin (1992) in his discussion of old
growth mixed mesophyte forests.<sup><a name="sdfootnote7anc" href="#sdfootnote7sym"><sup>7</sup></a></sup>
Such features combine to form a complex
horizontal and vertical structure that can accommodate a great
diversity of sensitive forest interior species. Examples
include most salamanders, small mammals, neotropical migrant birds,
and large raptors like the Coopers Hawk. Old
growth also hosts abundant arthropods; some, like the millipedes,
striking in appearance, some endemics (Hoffman, 1991).</p>
<p>
</p>
</ul>
<p><h2>Forest
Animals</h2>
<ul>
</p>
<p>	The
animals of the Central Appalachian forest are of no less consequence
than its grandest trees. They, in truth,
<i>are</i> the forest as much as the trees are. In
these forests all life forms, plants, animals, fungi, the micro
flora-and-fauna, are not only linked together in the dance of life
but actually emerge from each other in time. Look
at the forest scene &mdash;does it seem complex or chaotic in the
placement of trees, in the shape of limbs and the riot of plants on
the forest floor? Look again&mdash;and
again&mdash;and the longer you look the more order will appear.
Each twist of a limb has meaning in terms of
light and wind history. Genetic
adaptability calls forth thickened bark on the lower side of leaning
trunks to guard against fire, which burns hottest there. Moss
does grow preferentially on the north side of trees, but not blindly.
It always calculates modifying factors like the
shade of neighboring cliffs. Each nuance
of leaf form, texture and chemical make-up <i>potentially</i>
reflects a response to every insect, pathogen or browser the tree has
encountered in its long evolutionary history. We
have already seen that there is a fossil linkage between many of
today&rsquo;s trees and the great browsing fauna that lived 15,000
years ago. Similar relations are being
forged today.</p>
<p>	During
the last 15,000 years Central Appalachian forests as well as the rest
of North America experienced two great episodes of faunal decline.
The first of these was the wave of extinctions
as the ice age ended. The second is
on-going extinction and extirpation associated with the coming and
settlement of Europeans as well as modern development.
Unfortunately after partial recovery of our
forests from the original onslaught of the settlement period
extinction and extirpation are again on
the rise and may soon eclipse all species losses of the past.</p>
<p>	In
our forests birds are the most conspicuous animal life form.
We may only catch occasional glimpses of them
but their songs are seldom absent. In
these songs order is again manifest, not only in the characteristic
phrasing of each species but in what time of day and where in the
forest they are heard, whether at low or high elevation, in dry or
moist habitat and in which level of canopy. Throughout
the Central Appalachian deciduous forests and during most of the
summer several species make us aware of their presence by their
highly distinctive calls. Almost
omnipresent and most persistent are the vireos and especially the
Red-eyed Vireo. (<i>Vireo olivaceous</i>) with
its truncated Robin-like song. Another
is the Scarlet Tanager (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>), and although its
striking red and black plumage is usually hidden in the tree tops,
its voice &mdash;like a Robin with laryngitis&mdash;is unmistakable.
The third member of this conspicuous group is
the Wood Thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustelina</i>). This
bird is usually on or near the forest floor and its flute-like song,
once heard, will always conjure up the occasion of the first
experience. The calls of this group of
birds are low enough in pitch to be heard by almost everyone but
there is a host of small songsters, among which wood warblers
dominate, which in many cases have such high pitched songs as to
challenge some ears. These small birds
also tend to move fast in secretive ways. There
are of course many larger birds that we encounter less frequently
than tanagers or Wood Thrushes. One is
the Yellow-billed Cuckoo (<i>Coccyzus americanus</i>) which is heard
most frequently on rainy days. Another
is the Pileated Woodpecker (<i>Dryocopus pileatus</i>), crow-sized
with a flaming red crest and a loud
staccato call not too different from that of a
Coopers Hawk. This woodpecker seems to
thrive in the Appalachians, perhaps because of the frequency of ice
storms ensures a supply of broken trees and hence a ready diet of
wood borers.</p>
<p>	When
we climb to higher elevations, there is a change in forest type.
Above 3500 ft. asl throughout the Central
Appalachians we are likely to see the Wood Thrush replaced by its
relative the Veery (<i>Catharus fuscescens</i>) and more rarely by
Swainson's Thrush (<i>Catharus ustulatus</i>) or the Hermit Thrush
(<i>Catharus guttatus</i>). The
ethereal, wavy descending call of the Veery may, for example, be
heard in Red Oak forests along of the spine of Shenandoah Mountain or
the Virginia/West Virginia border while Swainson's and Hermit
Thrushes are most at home in the Allegheny
Spruce belt. Also at these elevations,
but some times much lower, we encounter
the Rose-breasted Grosbeak (<i>Pheucticus
ludovicianus</i>) with its more elegant-than-a-Robin, Robin-like
call, and bright plumage. At night and
on many dark days the airy bird voices of day are replaced by the
louder and more mysterious calls of owls and Whip-poor-wills
(<i>Caprimulgus vociferus</i>). Among
the owls, which number three common and several rare species in these
forests, the Barred Owl (<i>Strix varica</i>) is by far the most
conspicuous in most forest types. Its
boisterous and varied hooting is
probably the most impressive animal night sound. However
a close second is that of the Whip-poor-will, a member of the
Nightjar family. In the quiet forest
night the endless repetition of its name
by this bird transcends what might be irritation in another sound and
instead leaves one reassured of nature&rsquo;s vitality.</p>
<p>	In
the more restricted realm of the coniferous forest we find a number
of birds that not only form an extension of the boreal fauna but are
closely dependent on conifer seeds. The
Red Crossbill (<i>Loxia curvirostra</i>) is a small but conspicuous
inhabitant of the Allegheny spruce belt and the pine heaths that
occur on some of the highest elevations of the Valley and Ridge and
Blue Ridge provinces. It is dependent on
Red Spruce or, in the Valley and Ridge, on Pitch Pine and Table
Mountain Pines for most of its food and nesting habitat. On
June 19, 1984 I observed two males of this species singing
competitively on the very tops of two spruce trees. This
occurred near the summit of Spruce knob, the highest point in West
Virginia. Veeries were heard
singing in the same area. Another
similar bird of reddish plumage that depends on these conifers is the
Purple Finch (<i>Carpodacus purpur</i><i>eus</i>).
It may also be seen in large flocks in other
parts of the forest during spring migration. Space
limits discussion of all the northern bird species that extend their
ranges south along the Appalachians. However
two more yet merit our attention. They
are the Northern Raven (<i>Corvus corax</i>) and the Northern Goshawk
(<i>Accipiter gentilis</i>), both circumpolar species.
Although a disjunct population, the Northern
Raven thrives and may be seen in all parts of these mountains.
It is the dominant corvid in the mountains
proper but suffers harassment by crows in the agricultural valleys.
By contrast the Goshawk is rare and confined to
the most remote locations. It is however
extending its range southward.</p>
<p>	From
an ecological standpoint birds are rapid and convenient indicators of
forest richness or the quantity of
nutrients in the food chain. This soon
becomes apparent in any lengthy traverse. For
example, in the dry oak-chestnut type forest calls and other evidence
of birds will be few but as one approaches a cove or riparian zone
all these signs increase greatly. The
highest densities of birds of most kinds probably occur along streams
such as the South Branch of the Potomac or those of the Shenandoah
Valley all of which flow through regions of carbonate rocks.</p>
<p>	John
Terborgh (1990) and other have noted marked declines of songbirds in
eastern North America. For this reason
it is desirable to keep records on all possible species encountered.
One salient reason for decline in our region
that presents itself for continuous observation is the great
abundance of certain birds &mdash; crows, grackles, etc. &mdash; that
flourish in our agricultural valleys and which are known predators of
eggs and nestlings. These predatory
hoards are not only active in the Valleys but also far out into the
surrounding mountains. It is likely that
they are a major source of songbird decline even in some of the
remotest forest regions.											</p>
<p>	While
birds are the most conspicuous fauna of the Central Appalachians,
arthropods, and especially insects, interact far more pervasively
with the vegetation. The
role of such species as the Gypsy Moth and Pine Beetles as major
forest disturbances has already been discussed. But
disturbances tend to be episodic and species which play a continuous
part may be of even greater consequence. An
example is the nutrient recycling done by minute soil arthropods such
as springtails (<i>Collembola</i>), mites (<i>Acarina</i>) and others
that may reach population levels of many thousands in each square
meter of the forest floor. George W.
Byers has devoted 32 years to the study of these organisms at the
Mountain Lake Biological Station in Virginia&rsquo;s Valley and Ridge
(Byers, 1994) where he has found no significant decline or increase
in numbers during that time. The forest
studied is an undisturbed, although second growth, high
elevation oak forest. It is possible that the maturation of this
forest compensates for such factors as increases in air pollution.</p>
<p>	Like
the bird life Central Appalachian insects include a number of
disjunct northerners. Among Butterflies
are counted the rare Tawny Crescent
(<i>Phyciodes batesi</i>) and the Pink-edged sulfur (<i>Colias
interior</i>), an inhabitant of high elevation heaths where its larv&aelig;
feed on Blueberry leaves. Also included
in this group are a number of
Damselflies (Roble, 1994) which inhabit
mountain glades and wetlands. Some, like
<i>Enallag</i><i>ma cyathigerum</i>
have a circumpolar distribution.</p>
<p>	In
addition to disjunct northern species the Central Appalachians are
extraordinarily rich in native Butterflies. Milkweed
plants (<i>Asclepias</i> spp.) in forest
openings may attract swarms of Great Spangled Fritillaries (<i>Speyeria
cybele</i>) and along deep forest trails one can on occasion sight
the strikingly patterned male Diana (<i>Speyeria diana</i>).
Almost equally colorful are the large
millipedes that creep among the leaves,
especially in the rich cove forests. According
to Hoffman (1991) a number of these
arthropods are endemic to restricted localities. Occasionally
surprises are encountered as in late July 1994 in the deep valley of
Skidmore Fork that divides the Shenandoah Range. Here
we were assailed by clouds of tiny biting yellow insects that
appeared to be thrips rather than the expected flies. Could
it be that they mistook us for vegetation and the biting was random?
Thrips almost invariably suck plant juices.
Complementing these terrestrial arthropods are
numerous aquatic species that inhabit the mountain streams, ponds and
other wetlands. These include but are
not limited to amphipods, isopods, mayflies, dragonflies and
stoneflies.</p>
<p>	Perhaps
the vertebrates most closely tied to the forest environment are the
amphibians, the toads, frogs and salamanders that inhabit the forest
floor and forested and open wetlands.
Around a dozen species of toads and frogs
(anurans) and 20 salamanders occur in the region (Smith, 1978).
Given the apparent worldwide decline in
amphibian numbers and little available baseline data, it is difficult
to say with confidence what the health of our amphibian populations
is. We do have evidence that many
species suffered serious declines and probably some extinctions due
to past and ongoing settlement, logging and development stresses.
I have frequently been struck by the absence in
the Central Appalachians of the swarms of frogs (northern Leopard in
this case) that I remember from my Wisconsin childhood. Yet
there are selected areas in these forests where frogs are abundant.
This is especially apparent along the seeps,
streams and sinkholes at the western base of the Blue Ridge.
In this relatively acid environment the species
are mostly tiny Cricket and other Tree Frogs. But
larger species are also present. Other
species frequently noted are the Mountain Chorus Frog (<i>Pseudacris
brachyphona</i>), as in the high elevation pond on Potts Mountain,
and the Pickerel Frog (<i>Rana palustris</i>) in mainly acid seeps.
The most frequently
encountered species in dry upland forests far removed from water is
the Wood Frog (<i>Rana sylvatica</i>). In
circumneutral waters of limestone valleys the Bullfrog (<i>Rana
catesbyrania</i>) and the Green Frog (<i>Rana clamitans</i>), which
are more demanding of habitat, are usually present if not abundant.
Thankfully almost everywhere, where there is
standing water, we can still hear the melodic piping of the Peeper
Tree Frog (<i>Hyla crucifex</i>) soon after ice breaks in spring.</p>
<p>	Salamanders
have a unique place in the food chain since they are by life habit,
adapted to feeding upon the abundant soil fauna such as springtails
as well as other animals of the forest floor. They
are in turn fed upon by birds and larger animals who bring nutrients
to the top of the chain. Salamanders
fall into a number of family groupings. Among
the mole salamanders the Tiger Salamander (<i>Ambystoma tirgrinum</i>),
the largest terrestrial salamander,
occurs as a disjunct population, again
in the unusual aquatic habitat of sinkholes and seeps at the base of
the Blue Ridge. The most abundant
salamanders both as species and individuals are the lungless forms.
Some lungless salamanders are, like mole
salamanders, dependent on water bodies. However
the largest lungless group, the Woodland Salamanders, are liberated
from this requirement and lay their eggs in nests on the forest floor
or under rocks or debris. Of this group
the genus <i>Plethodon</i> is the most widespread and the Red-backed
Salamander (<i>Plethodon cinereus</i>) is probably the most common
salamander in the region. <i>Plethodons</i>
are known for their restricted mobility and many are confined to a
few square meters all their lives. Their
numbers may exceed 5000 per hectare (Burger, 1935) and it has been
estimated that salamanders represent the greatest concentration of
vertebrate biomass in these forests.</p>
<p>	Four
<i>Plethodons</i> in the Central Appalachians have some of the most
restricted ranges of any salamanders. They
are the Cheat Mountain (<i>Plethodon netlingi</i>), the Cowknob (<i>P.
punctatus</i>), the Shenandoah (<i>P. shenandoah</i>) and the Peaks
of Otter (<i>P. hubrichti</i>) Salamanders. Of
these the first three occur at the highest elevations but their
original ranges may once have extended lower. The
Shenandoah Salamander is the rarest of the four and is listed as
Endangered under the ESA. It is confined
to north and northwest facing talus slopes of Stony Man, The Pinnacle
and Hawksbill Mountains in a small area of Shenandoah National Park
and is a severe competition with the Red-backed Salamander.
The Cheat Mountain Salamander is confined to
scattered populations in high elevation spruce and northern hardwood
forests of the Allegheny spruce belt. It
is listed as Threatened under the ESA and like the Shenandoah
Salamander is in competition with the Red-backed
and other common salamanders. Both the
Cowknob and Peaks of Otter Salamanders are Category 2 under the ESA
but possess larger ranges than the other two salamanders. They
occur in deciduous forests, and in the case of the Cow Knob
Salamander, mostly in the high elevation Northern Red Oak zone
However the Cow Knob is also found as
low as 735 meters (2410 feet) asl and may have occupied a much larger
range before the mountains were logged at lower elevations.
Pauley (1993) has studied the Cheat Mountain
Salamander extensively and summarized the results. Summaries
of studies of the Shenandoah Salamander (Wynn,
1991), the Cowknob Salamander (Pague, Buhlmann, and Mitchell, 1991)
and the Peaks of Otter Salamander (Pague and Mitchell, 1991) are
contained in the book <i>Virginia&rsquo;s Endangered Species</i>.</p>
<p>	There
are three interesting salamanders without which our discussion would
be incomplete. The giant aquatic
Hellbender (<i>Cryptobranchus alleganiensis</i>) inhabits clear,
rocky headwaters of the Ohio and Tennessee drainage and reaches 740
mm (29 inches) in length. The Green
Salamander (<i>Aneides aeneus</i>) is the only salamander north of
Mexico with extensive green coloring and is the only climbing
salamander in the eastern U.S. and Canada. Perhaps
the most familiar of all salamanders in the region is the Eastern
Newt (<i>Notophthalmus viridescens</i>). Although
it breeds in water this salamander has an &ldquo;eft&rdquo; stage
which spends one to three years on land. Efts
are brilliant orange-red in color as a warning to birds of their
toxicity and thus stand out clearly on the forest floor. They
are also quite mobile and resistant to drying and are frequently
encountered particularly in rich woods, throughout the summer and
into fall.</p>
<p>	In
Central Appalachian forests reptiles are chiefly snakes and turtles
since the cool, humid climate does not favor lizards. Snakes
number perhaps a dozen non-poisonous species and two poisonous.
Among the former perhaps the most frequently
seen, at least at lower elevations, is the Rat or &ldquo;Black&rdquo;
Snake (<i>Elaphe obsoleta</i>), a large (up to 250 cm) constrictor
capable of killing large birds and an excellent climber.
Around streams the Northern Watersnake (<i>Nerodia
sipedon</i>) is frequently encountered. Among
smaller snakes the Garter Snake is most common but two elegant little
green snakes stand out. They are the
rough Green Snake (<i>Opheodrys &aelig;stivus</i>), of low to
moderate elevations, and the Smooth Green Snake (<i>Opheodrys
vernalis</i>) found in high elevation glades. Poisonous
snakes are represented by the Forest Rattler (<i>Crotalus horridus</i>)
a beautiful snake in either brilliant yellow or almost black color
phases that can lend excitement to a mountain hike when suddenly
encountered. Less flamboyant and more
secretive is the Copperhead (<i>Ag</i><i>kistrodon
contortrix</i>). Care
should be taken to avoid either species.</p>
<p>	Among
turtles the Eastern Box Turtle (<i>Terrapene carolina</i>) is by far
the most commonly encountered species in upland forests and is
present in fens and other wetlands as well. More closely
dependent on water as semi-aquatic species are
the Wood Turtle (<i>Clemmys insculpta</i>) and the Bog Turtle (<i>C.
muhlenbergi</i>). Both have suffered
greatly from loss of habitat and collecting. The
Bog Turtle in particular is very rare and is Category 2 under the
ESA. In productive wetlands and streams
the large aquatic Snapping Turtle (<i>Chelydra serpentina</i>) may be
abundant. Although closely tied to
swamps or marshes most of the year it seeks nearby uplands to lay its
eggs and undertakes extensive migrations between watersheds.
It does this during rainy periods when it may
sometimes be seen excavating temporary mud wallows on high ridges as
it pauses in its wanderings. 	Only a few
lizards find suitable habitat in the Central Appalachians. One
is the small, inconspicuous Coal Skink (<i>Eumeces anthracinus</i>),
an occupant of the forest floor at lower and moderate elevations.
Far more impressive is the Broadhead Skink (<i>E.
laticeps</i>) which favors wooded wetlands. I
was startled by one of these large lizards in late May as I
approached the shore of one of the sinkhole ponds at the base of the
Blue Ridge. A male with a bright red
head &mdash; the breeding coloration&mdash; emerged from the water
with a splash and dashed up a dead snag &mdash; &shy;certainly
a fitting complement to a day of botanizing. However
the species as well as suitable habitat is rare in these mountains
and confined to a few low elevation water-rich sites.</p>
<p>	Some
of our largest and wide-ranging mammals were extirpated since
Europeans overran the region. These
included the Gray Wolf, Bison and Elk or Wapiti. In
addition some smaller wilderness carnivores such as the Fisher
(<i>Martes pennanti</i>) and the Pine Martin (<i>Martes americana</i>)
disappeared with the virgin forests. The
status of the Eastern Cougar (<i>Felis concolor couguar</i>) is still
regarded as uncertain despite numerous reports of sightings of
cougars of some kind. The Porcupine
(<i>Erethizon dorsatum</i>) once ranged the spruce belt and northern
hardwoods of the Allegheny Plateau and undoubtedly into the valley
and ridge as well. Although regarded as
extirpated, &ldquo;vagrant&rdquo; Porcupines still turn up in the
region (Handley, 1991) and the species may be recovering as suitable
habitat regenerates. The animal&rsquo;s
only predator and nemesis is the Fisher, which has recently been
reintroduced, already awaits its return.</p>
<p>	Although
many of the larger animals native to the Central Appalachians
suffered extinction or extirpation during the last 15,000 years, a
number of smaller species which are really holdovers from the ice age
still survive. Examples are the Varying
or Snowshoe Hare (<i>Lepus americanus</i>), the Northern Flying
Squirrel (<i>Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus</i>), the Rock Vole (<i>Micr</i><i>otus
chrotorrhinus carolinensis</i>) and the
Water Shrew (<i>Sorex palustris</i>). The
Varying Hare is closely associated with Red Spruce forests as is the
Northern Flying Squirrel, while the Rock Vole and Water Shrew live
along high elevation rock slides and streams respectively.
More widespread but in similar habitat as the
Rock Vole is the Eastern Woodrat (<i>Ne</i><i>otoma
floridana</i>). Some
students of these two animals in Pleistocene deposits (e.g. Graham
and Lundelius, 1984) regard their association &ldquo;disharmonious&rdquo;
since the Rock Vole is northern species whereas the Wood Rat has a
decidedly southern distribution.</p>
<p>	Large
mammals that still occur in all Central Appalachian forest types are
species that have wide ranges in latitude and longitude. They
include the Black Bear (<i>Ursus americanus</i>), the White-tailed
Deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>), the Bobcat (<i>Lynx rufus</i>),
the Coyote (<i>Canis latrans</i>) and the Beaver (<i>Castor
canadensis</i>). The Beaver is of course
dependent on the presence of bodies of water and suitable food
plants. The Black Bear depends on
abundant food- usually nuts and berries- to fatten for winter.
It also requires mud wallows, so that the
isolated and scattered wetlands of these mountains form an important
part of habitat for this animal. It is
widely recognized now that in most part of the Central Appalachians
White-tailed Deer populations exceed carrying capacity. This
is shown particularly in overbrowsing of
certain plants &mdash; such as the Canada Yew for example&mdash; to
the extent that they are being extirpated over large areas. Another
emerging consequence of this overpopulation is the spread of Chronic
Wasting Disease  (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy)  in
White-tailed Deer  (information widely available on the internet). 
This disease, which is similar to Mad Cow Disease, is rampant in the
West and Midwest and will likely spread to the East, given the
continuum of overpopulated Deer herds linking the areas. 
</p>
<p>Bobcats
are always secretive but are powerful predators in their own right.
They may weigh 40 lbs. in these mountains and
are able to prey on small deer. The
Coyote appears to be a late arrival from
the West and has been increasing in numbers. This
small wolf preys on small animals including deer fawns. The
Beaver has a special role in that it diversified habitat through its
pond construction and tree felling. Since
the Beaver has only recently been making a comeback,
after virtual extirpation, it has not yet built up a full complement
of its successional habitat types in the region. In
the future this succession will result in many new wetland and grassy
openings as well as new stands of moisture loving forest types.</p>
<p>	A
group of wide-ranging and very adaptable small mammals today play a
more important role in forest ecology than in the past. They
are the Opossum (<i>Didelphis virginiana</i>), the Raccoon (<i>Procyon
lotor</i>), the Striped Skunk (<i>Mephetis mephetis</i>) and the Gray
Fox (<i>Urocyon cinereoargenteus</i>) All
have benefited from the activities of
humans and are adapted to forest edges and openings. Although
technically carnivores all are really omnivores. Humans
have favored these animals first by eliminating the large carnivores,
the wolves and Cougars, that once preyed upon them. Secondly
they benefit from the bountiful food, animal and vegetable, available
from agricultural activities in the mountain valleys. It
is a benefit they share with the local crows and Jays, and the
numerous grackles and blackbirds. The
result is an increase in numbers of both animal and bird predators,
numbers that then fan out into the surrounding mountains to prey on
increasingly vulnerable forest interior birds, amphibians and
reptiles. The creation of openings in
the mountain forests only exacerbates this situation as do the
&ldquo;wildlife&rdquo; management activities of the public
agencies.</p>
<p>	Two
groups of mammals that are more a part of the forest than most are
the squirrels and bats. The Northern
Flying Squirrel previously discussed has a more widespread low
elevation counterpart, the Southern Flying Squirrel (<i>Glaucomys
volans</i>). Far more conspicuous than
these small nocturnal animals however is the Eastern Gray Squirrel
(<i>Sciurus carolinensis</i>) and the more robust Eastern Fox
Squirrel (<i>Sciurus niger</i>). These
squirrels show great variation in local populations as a function of
soil fertility since they depend primarily on nut crops. They
are most abundant &mdash;as shown by nest frequencies&mdash;
in hickory forests of the limestone regions
where there may be several nests per acre. By
contrast, dry oak forests may show few signs of squirrels even when
acorns are abundant.</p>
<p>	Less
common at low elevations than Gray and Fox Squirrels but increasing
in numbers with elevation is the small but aggressive Red Squirrel
(<i>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</i>). Like
the Northern Flying Squirrel it is well adapted to spruce forests.</p>
<p>	More
than a dozen bat species are summer residents of the Central
Appalachians. All are closely tied to
forests, a fact unfortunately not appreciated by forest managers.
There is much concern for the preservation of
cave habitat for bats, a habitat some utilize year round and others
only for hibernation. In the Central
Appalachians, all caves are inextricably linked to forests.
Only forest cover in the cave vicinity can
reliably provide the steadiness of air flow, moisture content and
quality for optimum cave conditions. Similarly
only isolation or protection from vandals can prevent the destruction
of cave habitat that has become an epidemic. However
bats do not live by caves alone. They
spend much of their time foraging, mostly in forests, although this
includes forest openings particularly in wetlands
and along streams. Some bats also rear
their young in the forest. The rare
Indiana Bat (<i>Myotis sodalis</i>) forms maternity colonies of up to
90 females under the lose bark of large Shagbark Hickories, White
Oaks and other trees (Dalton and Handley, 1991). The
benefit of old growth forest to this species, which is listed as
Endangered under the ESA, is thus clear.</p>
<p>	Many
of the forest animals discussed here suffer from forest
fragmentation. Among all species the
need to move to seek new habitat to exchange genetic material between
metapopulations and particularly as a response to disturbances,
should be clear to every one. As
mentioned earlier, even highly aquatic species such as Snapping
Turtles and frogs need to move between aquatic habitats.
Although some species such as woodland
salamanders may be virtually confined to a few square meters of
forest floor throughout their lives they still must move to
re-colonize adjacent disturbed areas. These
salamanders are thwarted in this by even relatively narrow woods
roads if these have beds of dry soil or rock. Even
such mobile small mammals as squirrels need to migrate when nut crops
fail locally. Wide paved roads hinder
such movements and expose them to increased mortality in a number of
ways.</p>
