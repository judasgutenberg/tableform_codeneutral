<p><b>Garden Mountain</b>

<br><b>Source Walk: 7-2-99</b>
 
 

<p> Garden Mountain forms the southeast bound of the
Burkes Garden Valley in a region of complex geologic structure  (see our
section &quot;<a href=bowed.htm>Land of Bowed Mountains</a>&quot;) . Although not clearly
differentiated on the Geologic Map of Virginia  (Rader and Evans, 1993),  it is
likely that the Silurian age rocks, which comprise its crest, are composed
dominantly of erosion-resistant sandstones. In any case, such rocks are exposed
at the highest elevations attained on our traverse.
<p> Our traverse, which began at 9:00 AM, originated at
the State Route 623 crossing of the Appalachian Trail at an elevation of 3880
feet  (1183 m)  asl and extended southwest along the crest for approximately
1/3 mile  (0.5 km) . The weather was markedly cooler than at our Laurel Creek
camp 1300 feet  (396 m)  below  (see our section on <a href=littlewolf.htm>Little Wolf  and Laurel
Creeks</a>),  and it was overcast with a light drizzle. Veeries (<i>Catharus 
fuscesens</i>) called and warblers, among them Chestnut-sided (<i>Dendroica 
pensylvanica</i>),  as well as numerous other unidentified birds were
much in evidence foraging in both low and high foliage.
<p> The mature but young canopy at the road crossing
included Sugar and Red Maples, Northern Red Oak, Black Birch, the pignut
hickory <i>Carya glabra</i> and American
Basswood. A single 8 inch  (20 cm)  dbh Yellow Birch - the only member of the
species seen all day - was also noted. Striped Maple formed a sparse understory
and Allegheny Blackberry (<i>Rubus allegheniesis</i>) was the only shrub seen.
<p> This mesic canopy, perhaps reflecting in part the
relatively low local relief, was accompanied by a corresponding community of
herbs. This included abundant and vigorous Mountain Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia</i> <i>compressa</i>),  very
abundant Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia perfoliata</i>),  Common Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum 
biflorum</i>),  Broad-leaved Panic Grass (<i>Panicum latifolium</i>),  a
little May Apple (<i>Podophyllum peltatum</i>
), Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>),  Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum 
lanuginosum</i>),  Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax
 herbacea</i>
), a little each of the aliens Sweet Vernal Grass (<i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i>) and
Velvet Grass (<i>Holcus lanatus</i>),  common, but thinly
distributed Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>),  Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda 
cinnamomea</i>),  Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia quadrifolia</i>),  a
Clintonia  (likely <i>Clintonia borealis</i>),  the sedges <i>Carex 
appalachica</i> and <i>C 
vulpinoides,</i> and on rocks,
Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>) and species of <i>Dicranum</i> and <i>Hypnum</i>. 
<p> This mesic flora accompanied us for a distance along
the trail, where we saw Revolute Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum revolutum</i>), 
Horse Balm (<i>Collinsonia canadensis</i>),  Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago 
curtisii</i>),  Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana</i>),  White
Avens (<i>Geum canadense
</i>) in bloom, White Snakeroot (<i>
Eupatorium rugosum</i>),  abundant
Sugar Maple seedlings, Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa
 bracteata</i>
), the mosses <i>Hedwigia ciliata 
</i>and a <i>Dicranum </i>together on rocks, Early Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum 
dioicum</i>),  Virginia Knotweed (<i>Polygonum virginianum</i>) and American Lovage (<i>Ligusticum canadense</i>) .
<p> Now beginning to climb, we encountered our first and
abundant Southern Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium erythrocarpum</i>),  American Chestnut (<i>Castanea 
dentata</i>) sprouts, a vine, likely Climbing False Buckwheat (<i>Polygonum 
scandens</i>),  the sedge <i>Carex digitalis</i>, Cucumbertree, White Ash, Wood Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>),  the
first Wild Lily of the Valley (<i>Convallaria
 montana</i>), Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium virginianum</i>) on sandstone and Canada
Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>) in bloom. Also seen here, as
well as earlier along the trail, was Fire Pink (<i>Silene virginica</i>) in full bloom. Some fungi noted on this section of the Trail
were <i>Collybia dryophylla</i>, <i>Tricholomopsis platyphylla 
</i>and the edible Honey Mushroom (<i>Armillariella mellea</i>) .
<p> Still climbing, we saw in turn Hairy Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza</i> <i>claytoni</i>),  Wild
Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>),  Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria 
pubera</i>),  Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>),  Saw Brier (<i>Smilax 
glauca</i>),  Smooth Rockcress (<i>Arabis laevigata</i>),  Enchanter's Nightshade (<i>Circaea 
quadrisulcata</i>),  Boott's Goldenrod (<i>Solidago boottii</i>),  Galax (<i>Galax 
aphylla</i>),  Bowman's Root (<i>Gillenia</i> <i>trifoliata</i>
), an American Robin (<i>Turdus migratorius</i>),  Starry Campion (<i>Silene 
stellata</i>),  the Split-gill Mushroom (<i>Schizophyllum commune</i>),  the dewberry <i>Rubus 
flagellaris</i>, Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex</i>), 
abundant Striped Maple, Bracken Fern (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>),  Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga 
racemosa</i>) and abundant Bloodroot (<i>Sanguinaria canadensis</i>) .
During this climb we heard frequent calls of Veeries, although this bird was
never sighted. The alternation in this section between acidiphile and more
alkaline-ranging plants likely reflects the inability of the coarse grain of
our inventory to adequately assess microhabitats.
<p> Continuing, we saw a lone seedling of Yellow Buckeye
(<i>Aesculus octandra</i>) and the only representative of the species see all
day; then the fungi <i>Mycena leaiana</i> 
and an unidentified <i>Mycena</i>,
more Fire Pink, an unidentified Azalea (<i>Rhododendron
</i> sp),  a <i>Paronychia</i>, Virginia Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum</i>), 
Black Cherry, Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>),  seedlings of Bitternut
Hickory (<i>Carya cordiformis</i>),  Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda claytoniana</i>) and
Native Yarrow (<i>Achillea millifolium </i> var <i>lanulosa</i>) . Here we again became aware of the sandy character of
the soil, a product of weathering of the sandstone.
<p> We now observed an unusual occurrence of Hairy
Heuchera (<i>Heuchera villosa</i>) on a tree stump; then an
unusual association consisting of a few plants of Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria 
procumbens</i>) and Mealy Bellwort, and following these, abundant
Southern Mountain Cranberry, the first-noted Fire Cherry (<i>Prunus pensylvanica</i>),  a
haircap moss (<i>Polytrichum </i> sp)  on rock, then Mountain Bellwort (<i>Uvularia 
pudica</i>) with Upland Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>) and
very abundant Wild Lily of the Valley. Also seen here was the first Highbush
Blueberry (<i>V. corymbosum</i>) with heavy clusters of berries, some of which
were of a dark blue ripeness. It is possible that this blueberry is a hybrid,
with Southern Mountain Cranberry as a participant.
<p> Moving again along the Trail we at first saw abundant
Wild Sarsaparilla under a canopy of Northern Red Oak with American
Chestnut sprouts and, a little farther
on, Chestnut Oak. Then,under blackberry bushes, we were surprised to see a
large, beautifully patterned American Toad (<i>Bufo americanus</i>),  which,
on our return we were to again see still at precisely the same location.
<p> We now began to climb more steeply under rainy skies,
noting in succession Dotted St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum punctatum</i>),  Rock
Fern, More Native Yarrow, Serviceberry of unidentified species (<i>Amelanchier</i> sp),  the first observed White Oak, Wavy-leaf Aster (<i>Aster 
undulatus</i>),  Mountain Laurel, Wild Crabapple (<i>Malus coronaria</i>),  Sugar Maple, Bracken Fern and Pale-leaved Sunflower (<i>Helianthus 
strumosus</i>).

<p>

<p> Presently we reached a local summit at 4052  (1236 m
) asl on a prominent outcrop of sandstone. A low scattered canopy of Red Maple,
Downy Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier arborea</i>),  Black Birch, Fire Cherry and
Mountain Ash (<i>Sorbus americana</i>) was accompanied by a shrub
layer of Black Chokeberry (<i>Aronia melanocarpa</i>
), Highbush Blueberry with green fruit, Mountain Laurel, Pennsylvania
Blackberry (<i>Rubus pensilvanicus</i>) and Black Huckleberry (<i>Gaylussacia 
baccata</i>) . Of particular interest among herbs was the biennial Pink
Corydalis (<i>Corydalis sempervirens</i>),  a boreal plant then in
bloom. Other species noted in this climatically severe location were Saw Brier,
very luxuriant Mountain Bellwort with copious fruit, abundant Wild Lily of the
Valley, Rock and Intermediate Shield Ferns and Mountain Oat Grass. Birds heard
and/ or seen here were Turkey Vulture (<i>Cathartes aura</i>),  Cardinal (<i>Cardinalis cardinalis</i>) and
Towhee (<i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus</i>) .
<p> As we again moved downslope through a forest with
trees generally stunted and distorted by the elements, we successively
encountered the pignut <i>Carya glabra</i>, a very vocal pair of Carolina
Wrens (<i>Thyrothorus ludvicianus</i>) and, reflecting this xeric
southwest slope, Smooth Yellow Foxglove (<i>Aureolaria flava</i>),  Scarlet and Chestnut Oaks, both
stunted, a <i>Xerula</i> fungus, Deer Berry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i>), 
Mountain Laurel, Bracken Fern, Cow Wheat (<i>Melampyrum lineare</i>) and more Chestnut Oak. We then
began to see abundant and very luxuriant Hairy Heuchera in an unfamiliar
habitat for this plant, namely flat areas of ground, but usually on rocks. Also
seen here were Variable Panic Grass (<i>Panicum
 commutatum</i>
), Bushy Panic Grass (<i>P. dichotomum</i>),  Pasture Rose (<i>Rosa 
carolina</i>),  Wild Sarsaparilla and abundant macrolichens, including
species of <i>Usnea</i>, on tree trunks.
Additional fungi identified were <i>Crepidotus mollis</i>, <i>C. applantus </i>and an unidentified &quot;wolf's
milk&quot; slime mold.
<p> A species that had been observed earlier along the
Trail, and which attracted our attention here, was the grass Nimblewill (<i>Muhlenbergia schreberi</i>),  and perhaps indicating a more than usual fertile
patch of soil, there was stunted Poke (<i>Phytolacca americana</i>),  the alien Orchard Grass (<i>Dactylis 
glomerata</i>),  Squaw Root (<i>Conopholis americana</i>),  Bitternut Hickory, Sugar
Maple, the hawthorn<i>Crataegus flabellata</i>, Black Raspberry (<i>Rubus 
occidentalis</i>) and the fungus <i>Mycena pura</i>.
<p> We soon arrived at another conspicuous but somewhat
lower sandstone outcrop which bore a community comprised of Pink Corydalis,
with abundant Hairy Heuchera, Canada Mayflower and cushions of unidentified
species of <i>Dicranum </i>and <i>Leucobryum</i> mosses. Seen at the edge of this outcrop
were unidentified Muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia</i>
) and <i>Andropogon</i> grasses, Purple Bedstraw (<i>Galium 
latifolium</i>),  Mountain Maple (<i>Acer spicatum</i>) and Alternate-leaf Dogwood (<i>Cornus 
alternifolia</i>) .
<p> We ended our traverse amidst abundant Nodding Fescue,
a little Asiatic Water Pepper (<i>Polygonum caespitosum</i>) and a single
healthy-appearing Canada Hemlock.
<p> Some species missed during our traverse but seen on
our return to the road were Golden Alexander (<i>Zizia trifoliata</i>), 
Entire-leaved Yellow Foxglove (<i>Aureolaria laevigata</i>),  Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster 
macrophyllus</i>) and the fungi <i>Stereum ostrea</i> 
and <i>Trichaptum</i> <i>biforme</i>.
<p> The plant communities on the Garden Mountain summit
form a mosaic of nesic, quite rich soil types and acid- mesic and acid-xeric
oligotropic types. Given that such high exposed ridges are almost invariably
composed of erosion- resistant sandstone or quartzite, the presence of any
mesic, rich soil communities may at first seem contradictory. To resolve this
conundrum we must consider likely conditions for mass wasting on such ridges.
First, it seens reasonable that for every unit lowering in elevation of the
summit an enormous quantity of rock must be removed from the supporting slopes
by slumping, sliding and water erosion. However, on the summit such processes
are very limited since only weak gradients for them exist. Reduction in
elevation must therefore result largely from <i>in situ</i> weathering through chemical dissolution, frost heaving
etc., although wind erosion may play a role even in humid climates.
<p> Although the solubility of silica in the quartz of
sandstone is only of the order of 6 parts per million  (Anderson,1972),  its
much lower concentration in rainwater insures that dissolution of sandstone
will occur on these exposed ridges. By contrast, some impurities in the sandstone,
such as the mineral apatite,which contain important soil nutrients such as
phosphorus and calcium, have even lower solubilities than silica  (Fuller, 1972
). Consequently such nutrients may tend to accumulate in catchment areas of the
summit as the sandstone weathers. These catchment areas may then favor mesic
communities while more exposed areas would tend to be occupied by acid-xeric
types.

<p><b>Lick Creek/ Hunting Camp Creek Valley
Divide<i></i></b>

<br><b>Source Walk: 7-2-99</b>
<ul>
<p>On our return from Garden Mountain we stopped briefly
at the divide that separates the Lick and Hunting Creek Valleys. Elevation here
is a little above 2700 feet  (824 m)  asl. The forest on the lower slope is an
ericaceous oak type with a canopy dominated by White, Black, Scarlet and
Chestnut Oaks, with subordinate Red Maple, Black Gum, the pignut <i>Carya glabra</i> and Fraser Magnolia. Striped Maple,  Sourwood (<i>Oxydendrum 
arboreum</i>) . Chinquapin (<i>Castanea pumila</i>),  Upland Low Blueberry and an
unidentified Azalea (<i>Rhododendron </i> sp)  formed 
understory and shrub layers. Identified in the ground cover were
Teaberry, Round -leaf Pyrola (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia</i>),  Gay Wings (<i>Polygalla 
paucifolia</i>),  Cow Wheat, Galax, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera 
pubescens</i>),  the woodrush <i>Luzula acuminata</i>, Bushy Panic Grass, Mountain
Oat Grass, <i>Carex digitalis</i> and the orchid Whorled Pogonia (<i>Isotria verticillata</i>) . A
species of <i>Hypnum </i>moss was common on
rocks.
