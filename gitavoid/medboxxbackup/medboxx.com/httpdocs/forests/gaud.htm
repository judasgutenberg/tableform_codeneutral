<h1>Gaudineer Scenic Area and Vicinity</h1>
<ul>
<blockquote>


<p><b>November 2000</b>














<ul>



<p><h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<p>The Gaudineer Scenic Area
lies near the crest of Shavers Mountain immediately north of Gaudineer Knob, a
4309 ft  (1314 m)  asl prominence on this range. The Scenic Area elevation is a
little below 4050 ft  (1235 m)  and was the site of several of our inventories
as well as that of Adams and Stephenson  (1989) , who studied the possible
decline of the old growth Red Spruce.
<p>Bedrock in the area is
highly variable, particularly with respect to elevation. It includes erosion
resistant Pennsylvanian Pottsville Group rocks  (Kanawha, New River and
Pocahontas Formations) , which occupy the high ridges in the form of coarse and
frequently conglomeratic sandstones. The lower-lying Mississippian Bluestone and
Hinton Formations are dominated by weaker &quot;red, green and medium gray
shales and sandstones&quot;  (Cardwell <i>et al</i>, 1968).  In the case of the
Hinton, thin beds of limestone may occur as well. Aspects in the Scenic Area are generally east and southeast, with
some southwest also.
<p>Although our investigations in the area were brief,
they revealed several important features bearing on the floristics and
stability relations of species. The Scenic Area is notable as one of the few
remnants of old growth Red Spruce in the Central Appalachians  (Braun, 1950;
Core, 1966).  The Scenic Area is generally regarded as a unit in terms of soils
and flora. However, we find that both may vary widely within its extent, which,
according to Adams and Stephenson, covers about 50 ha  (124 acres).  This
variation is clearly to a large degree a consequence of the geology. For
example, much of the southern part is dominated by coarse conglomeratic
sandstone, presumably Pottsville. These rocks yield stony, sandy and very acid
soils capped by mor-like unincorporated organic matter, especially under the
Spruce which is concentrated on them.
Also according to Adams and Stephenson, the finer mineral component of these
soils has of the order of 60% sand. By
contrast, the northern part of the Scenic Area appears to be underlain by far
weaker rocks that are seldom exposed, and which yield deep clay and silt loams
that in places have well developed A horizons in which organic matter is
incorporated. It is possible that some of the conglomeratic sandstone, which is
in the form of large flat-topped, angular blocks lying on the surface, has
arrived at its location by motion down-slope, and the same may be true of the
stony and sandy soils derived from it.
<p>North of the Scenic Area, at least along a trail
that leads northeast down-slope  (here referred to as the &quot;Camp
Trail&quot;) , there is a continuation of the weak bedrock and well-developed
soils. It is possible that this material represents the Bluestone or even the
Hinton Formation, although the latter is unlikely at the elevations traversed
by us. In any case, the area contrasts greatly with the conglomeratic sandstone
area in forest type represented. The
canopy is dominated by mesic deciduous species consisting of nutrient-demanding
trees such as White Ash and Basswood with only scattered Spruce saplings, and
there is a corresponding diverse mesic herb flora
<p>Gaudineer 
Knob exhibits extremes in both topography and flora. According to
Cardwell <i>et al</i>  (1968) , the summit is divided by the contact of the
Kanawha and New River Formations, and the most conspicuous exposed rock is a
coarse sandstone with very angular grains. The canopy consists of virtually
pure Red Spruce and there is a depauperate herb flora.
<p>Of considerable interest also is the extensive wetland
along Glade Run, which lies a few miles north of the Gaudineer Scenic Area.
Additionally, the area presents opportunities to study the simultaneous effects
of variations in rock type and elevation on the flora of the adjacent scarp
that overlooks the Greenbrier Valley.
<p>The Gaudineer Scenic Area vicinity may also be
compared informatively with forests along Blister Run and slopes adjacent to
the Run and Shaver's Fork</a>  (see <a href=blisterer.htm>our section on these areas</a>).  Although these
areas lie at 300 feet  (122 m)  or more lower in elevation than the Scenic
Area, their floras possess a more boreal character. Generally also soils appear
considerably less fertile than the most fertile ones of the Scenic Area.
Similarly the dominance of Spruce on Gaudineer Knob may be as much a
consequence of aspect and the
relatively sterile sandstones and derived soils as the small additional
increment of elevation.
<p>Here we present the results of six inventories,
including four in the Gaudineer Scenic Area, one along the Camp Trail and a
brief foray to the Gaudineer Knob summit. Our inventories previous to that of
6-29-00 were conducted in the absence of a knowledge of the different terrain
and soil types in the Scenic area and along the Camp Trail. Consequently, certain species listed are not
specifically related to substrate. This
problem is for the most part resolved by our inventories of 6-29-00.

<b>Source walk: 8-10-97 and 8-3-97</b>

<ul>
 The following
is a report of a brief inventory initiated on the sunny late morning of 8-10-97
in the upper part of the Scenic Area just east of forest road 27.Also included
are some independent observations of species made by R. Hunsucker on 8-3-97.As is conventional in this work, only common
names are given for familiar woody species, while both common and scientific
names of less familiar species are 
given on first mention, but, with some exceptions, only common names
thereafter.
<p> Our traverse extended directly down slope from the
parking lot, ignoring foot paths After
perhaps one fifth mile  (0.32 km) we
turned north and then returned via a forest path. Large Red Spruce, many in
excess of two feet (60 cm)dbh, dominate the canopy but Yellow Birch, Beech and
Red Maple, in that order of abundance, occupy most of the area.Scattered
large White Ash, smaller Cucumber and
Fraser Magnolias and a few small Black
Cherry and Sugar Maple saplings were also seen. Striped Maple is the most common understory species, but Mountain
Maple (<i>Acer spicatum</i>) and Smooth Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier laevis</i>) are also present. Devils's Walking Stick (<i>Aralia
spinosa</i>) , a southern species, was
seen at the parking lot. Shrubs,include Mountain Holly(<i>Ilex montana</i>) , Hobblebush (<i>Viburnum</i>
<i>alnifolium</i>) ,Alternate-leaf Dogwood (<i>Cornus alternifoli</i>a) a little Southern
Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium
erythrocarpum</i>) ,Red Elderberry (<i>Sambucus
pubens</i>) and Thornless Blackberry (<i>Rubus
canadensis</i>), and are, for the most part, northern or high elevation
species. Some trees, especially the largest, showed fire scars.
<p> Successively noted as we moved down slope were Red
Fescue (<i>Festuca rubra) </i> at the
parking lot, numerous Red Spruce saplings in tree fall gaps, dark organic soil
clinging to rootwads and exposed white
sand subsoil at the upooted trees,the general dominance of Intermediate Shield
Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>), the abundance of White Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis montana</i>) at tree bases ,
Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia</i> <i>punctilobula</i>) in more open areas,
scattered deer-browsed Blackberries (possibly <i>Rubus canadensis</i>), <i>Xerula
furfuracea</i>, an edible fungus of northern distribution, Mountain Holly, <i>Dicranum</i> and <i>Hypnum</i> mosses and the
liverwort <i>Bazzania trilobata</i>. We then
reached a strong seep or spring in and around which grew the following: an
abundant large-leaved <i>Mnium</i> 
moss, likely <i>Mnium punctatum</i>
(based on charcteristics and habitat), also abundant Shining Clubmosss (<i>Lycopodium
lucidulum</i>), Alpine Enchanters Nightshade (<i>Circaea alpina</i>) in full bloom, Drooping Wood Reed Grass (<i>Cinna latifolia</i>) , Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>) much browsed by
deer, Foam Flower (<i>Tiarella cordfolia</i>) , a beggar tick (<i>Bidens </i>sp.), Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>) , Northern White Violet (<i>Viola pallens</i>), Intermediate Shield Fern , Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>) Downy Wood Violet (<i>V iola sororia</i>) , Selfheal (<i>Prunella
vulgaris var vulgaris</i>) , Hispid
Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus</i> <i>hispidus var hispidus</i>) , Crooked-stem
Aster (<i>Aster prenanthoides</i>) Partridge
Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>) , the alien
Coltsfoot(<i>Tussilago farfara</i>),
Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>) ,
the sedges <i>Carex intumescens</i>, <i>C. debilis</i> and <i>C</i>. <i>brunnescens,</i> with the
last-named characteristically on rocks.
Leaving the seep area, we noted in order White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium rugosum</i>) , Hobblebush, the fungus <i>Rickenella fibula</i> in moss, Hay-scented Fern, Striped Maple, Autumn
Bent Grass (<i>Agrostis</i> <i>perennans</i>) , <i>Carex baileyi</i>, Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium virginianum</i>) on rocks, 
Semi-rounded conglomeratic flags, <i>Carex
crinita</i> in a moist spot, Upright
Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis stricta</i>
), stunted and unhealthy-looking Wood
Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>) , the
alien variety of Woodland Strawberry (<i>Fragaria
vesca</i>) on a foot path crossing, Two-leaved Tooth-wort (<i>Dentaria diphylla</i>) , Alternate-leaved
Dogwood ,Roundleaf Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia</i>)and
a trace of Broadleaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago
flexicaulis</i>), which is generallay confined to good soils. Here we were struck again by the general
abundance of White Wood Sorrel at tree bases, frequently with Canada Mayflower
(<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>) , then noted
the conifer root parasitic fungus <i>Phaeolus
schweinitzii</i> and nearby a species of <i>Lactarius</i>.
At this point we encountered a large uprooted tree with a large rootwad to
which adhered a layer of black organic soil with embedded rocks and exposing a
white sandy subsoil. Within and at base of this rootwad we observed the only
Red Elderberry plants of the traverse. Not far down slope these were followed
by Purple-leaved Willowherb (<i>Epilobium</i>
<i>coloratum</i>) and a Fraser Magnolia (<i>Magnolia fraseri</i>)  sapling.
Here also we examined a very rotted down bole perhaps 16 inches (40 cm) in
diameter. This bole was found to be a veritable sponge with the same
consistancy and as much water could be squeesed out. Thus the water stored in
such dead wood must indeed be great in quantity and serve as a continuous source of air and soil
humidity. Continuing down slope we noted abundant False Haircap Moss (<i>Atrichum </i>sp) , White Ash, Cucumber
Magnolia, the liverwort <i>Nowellia
curvifolia</i> on a down bole, and on a
dead spruce, another liverwort <i>Neckera
pennata</i>, a northern species not common farther south. Here also we noted
the familiar wood staining fungus <i>Chlorociboria
aeruginascen</i>s that on the exterior of the wood is black and in the interior
green.These were followed by <i>Amanita
fulva </i>and the white Cheese Polypore (<i>Tyromyces</i>
<i>chioneus</i>).  Here also, as at Blister
Run Swamp, we encountered a swarm of the Housefly-like fly that landed on one
but that didn't bite and was only mildly annoying.
<p> Our traverse then reached another small seep, which
was marked by <i>Carex</i> <i>scabrata. </i>Nearby were Mountain Maple,
Mountain Aster (<i>Aster acuminatus</i>),
abundant Intermediate Shield Fern, a little Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa uniflora</i>) and the bracket fungus <i>Fomintopsis pinicola</i>. Moving on, we heard distant
calls of the Hermit Thrush (<i>Catharus
guttatus</i>) noted the fungus <i>Paxillus
atrotomentosus, ch</i>aracteristically for this northern species, on a Red
Spruce stump, and conspicuous fire scars on a number of the largest trees.
<p> Our attention was next attracted by many small Indian
Turnip (<i>Aresaema</i> <i>triphyllum</i>) seedlings, but not a plant over several inches in
height was seen here- or indeed anywhere, on our traverse. It is possible that
seeds were delivered to this inhospitable spot in the scat of an animal,
encouraged to sprout by the abundant moisture, but could not cope with the high
acidity.
<p> We now reached a foot path which was subsequently
followed up slope on our return. At this juncture we became aware of several
small Beech trees which showed leaf curl and accompanying scale insects on
their bark. However this was unusual, since Beech in this forest appeared
generally healthy. Moving along the
path, we noted growing by its side Riparian Wild Rye (<i>Elymus riparius)</i> and we again heard the distant song of the Hermit
Thrush. Subsequently, quite near the trail, we passed a tall straight White Ash
near 30 inches (76 cm) dbh and not far beyond a near 40 inch  (1 meter)  dbh
Yellow Birch with a prominent basal fire scar. Continuing onward, we saw our
sole plant of Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>) as well as our first
Indian Cucumberroot (<i>Medeola virginiana</i>).
These were followed by Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax
rotundifolia</i>) in virtually the only display of a woody vines in this
forest, and shortly by Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca
obtusa</i>). The latter faithfully registered the elevation by the retarded
development of its seeds, which corresponded to those seen more than a month
earlier in the Shenandoah Valley. Also favored by conditions along the path was
a lush stand of White Grass (<i>Leersia
virginica</i>), while the fungus <i>Polyporus
elegans</i> caught our eyes on nearby dead wood. Momentarily we were also
fortunate enough to see a very large, perhaps 3 inch (7.6 cm), ichneuman.  This spectacular insect had a
black abdomen and thorax , yellow legs and a white, centimeter- broad muscle at
the end of its abdomen, with which it was driving its ovipositer into a tree at
eye level. While a photograph was made, time did not permit further
observation, and unfortunately, through oversight , neither the species nor the
condition of the tree was determined. 
However, an identification from the photograph was hazarded by Dr.
Richard Hoffman of The Virginia Museum of Natural History and revealed the
insect to be <i>Megarhyssa atrata</i>. 
 
<p> Approaching the parking lot, our final observations
included Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii</i>) , Mountain Oatgrass 
 (<i>D</i><i>anthonia compressa</i>), , the fungus <i>Gloeophyllum seprarium</i> on the base of a Red Spruce and a fresh pile
of Blue Jay (<i>Cyanocitta</i> <i>cristata</i>) feathers, presumably plucked
by a hawk or owl.

<p> Our inventory of 6-29-00 in
the Scenic Area's old growth was conducted chiefly to clarify questions
regarding certain mesic species such as White Ash and the nature of soil types
in the vicinity of the loop trail as encountered on 8-10-97. Our traverse of
6-29-00 was begun after awakening to the calls of Veeries (<i>Catharus fuscescens</i>) and Hermit Thrushes. Although the sun was
intermittently visible at first, the sky soon cleared; however it remained
cool.

<p> Our traverse began at the
parking lot and initially followed the southeast section of the loop trail,
then completed the circuit to the north. As previously noted, the southeast
section is characterized by large blocks of conglomeratic sandstone and soils
derived from it. Although a mor type soil is developed in places, it is largely
confined to the vicinity of Spruce, since leaves of deciduous trees such as Yellow Birch decay rapidly and do not
accumulate in organic layers. This presumably is the type of terrain on which
Adams and Stephenson (1989)  conducted their investigation, and, while austere,
according to these authors had a substantial number of Spruce that exceeded 2
ft  (0.6 m)  dbh. Our own investigations along this traverse disclosed these
soils to be very hard and difficult to penetrate beneath the mor layer.
Although we did not determine pH for this soil type, Adams and Stephenson
report values well below 4.0.

<p>



<p> After these general
observations, we successively encountered the following: White Woodland
Strawberry (<i>Fragaria vesca</i> var <i> alba</i>) with characteristic white but flavorful fruit,
Yellow-rumped and Magnolia
Warblers  (<i>Dendroica coronata</i>
and <i>D. magnolia</i>) <i>,</i> an eft
of the Eastern Newt (<i>Notophthalmus 
viridescens</i>) , the frequent occurrence of small  (one to five cm) 
Red Spruce seedlings on rotting down boles and on large rock surfaces, but
their scarcity elsewhere; then a Winter Wren (<i>Troglodytes troglodytes</i>) , a Slate-colored Junco (<i>Junco hyemalis</i>) , followed by seedlings of
Mountain Maple and a dead millipede that resembled the common <i>Sigmoria 
aberrans,</i> which emits a burnt almond odor. After noting the poison
puffball <i>Scleroderma citrinum</i>
and Rock Fern, we came to an overturned tree the rootwad of which exposed
typical gray sandy soil of the conglomeratic sandstone terrain type.
<p> As the trail bore more toward
the north, we entered terrain with fewer and far different exposed rocks than
the conglomeratic sandstones. Detached fragments of these rocks included
&quot;rotten&quot; sandstone with a black  (Manganese oxide ?)  patina surface
and , on breaking, a rusty interior. The associated soil was a deep clay and /
or silt loam, tan in color at depth but, as exposed in a tree fall pit, with an
A horizon about a foot  (0.3 m)  in depth and almost black in color. This
indication of well – incorporated organic matter was coupled with a virtual
absence of a leaf mat, a characteristic of rich mesic forests. Consistent with
these features was the presence of a far different forest type from the typical
Spruce – dominated forest. It was here that we encountered the 30 inch  (0.76 m
) dbh White Ash reported for our 1997 visit. However, in the interim it had
suffered a lightning stroke that stripped perhaps a lethal amount of bark from
its down-slope side. This large tree occupied a shallow gully that extended
directly down slope both above and below. A soil sample  (no 3)  taken just
upslope from this tree had an initial pH value of 4.7 and the same 19 hours
later. A sample  (no 4)  taken downslope had an initial value of 5.8 and a 5.6
value 19 hours later. It is likely that gully reflects weaker rocks than those
adjacent to it as well as rich soils at this location. Associated plants of this
White Ash included Wild Ginger, Seedlings of Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>) , stunted Wood Nettle, Hairy
Sweet Cicely in seed, seedlings of Sugar Maple, Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium purpureum</i>) , the usual small Indian
Turnip, the sedge<i>Carex laxiflora</i>,
Two-leaved Toothwort, stunted and totally 
vegetative Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum 
lanuginosum</i>) , Sweet-scented Bedstraw, two seedlings of White Ash
and a single seedling of Northern Red Oak  (the only oak of any kind seen by us
in the entire region of Shaver's Mountain!).  A ¾ inch  (2 cm)  living coiled
gastropod was also seen here.
<p> Upslope, above the trail, this
rich mesic community continued to occupy the gully and here included a grove of
small Sugar Maple ranging up to a foot  (o.3 m)  dbh; then farther up, a 38
inch  (one m)  veteran of the species encrusted with the lichen<i>Lobaria pulmonaria</i>, while the edible fungus<i>
Boletus badius</i> grew in the
vicinity. Also seen here were Ramps in flower and an Eastern Garter Snake (<i>Thamnophis sirtalis 
sirtalis</i>).  This community included a little blooming White Wood
Sorrel, which was however far less abundant than in the Spruce forest. Also
present were patches of Partridge Berry, but these were confined to the gully's
upper edge, where they likely benefited from acid leaching.

<p> Continuing along the trail
toward the north, we noted very conspicuous fruiting of an unidentified species
of <i>Hypnum</i> moss on a down bole and a number of inch-long golden slugs of
a type  (species ?)  that appears to be common throughout the Central
Appalachians. As we neared the trail terminus 
we discovered a quite different slug, one inch  (2.5 cm)  in length,
with a striking color pattern of dark brown stripes and blotches on a cream
background. Here also, on the previous day, we had taken a soil sample  (no 1) 
from a 2-3 inch depth on a trailside bank among Spruce saplings and an
acidiphile ground flora. A pH value of 4.5 was found for this sample.
<p> Additional fungi collected and
identified by R. Hunsucker on this traverse were the following:
<p>
<br><i>Amanita ceciliae</i> – on soil.
<br><i>Amanita frostiana</i> – on soil.
<br><i>Amanita porphyria</i> – on soil.
<br><i>Amanita sinicoflava</i> – on soil.
<br><i>Amanita vaginata</i> – on soil
<br><i>Calocera cornea</i> – on decaying wood.
<br><i>Claricorona pyxidata </i>– on decaying wood.
<br><i>Entoloma
</i> sp – on soil.
<br><i>Leccinum scabrum</i> – on soil.
<br><i>Pholiota
</i> sp – on decaying wood.
<br><i>Stropharia
</i> sp. – on wood.

<h2>Camp and Camp Trail</h2>

<p><b>Source Walks: 6-28-00 and
6-29-00</b>
<ul>
<p>Our
camp was established at the trailhead on Forest Road 27. This trail, referred
to as the &quot;Camp Trail&quot;, extends northeast approximately along the
Randolph – Pocahontas County line. The trailhead lies about 100 m northeast of
the Scenic Area parking lot. The weather, on our arrival , was characterized by
intermittent rain and cool temperatures.
<p>An interesting observation made on our way along FR
27 was of Mountain Laurel (<i>
Kalmia latifolia</i>) in a state of
full flower at an elevation similar to that at camp, whereas this plant's
blooms had already been faded weeks earlier at a higher elevation on Shenandoah
Mountain in the Valley and Ridge to the east.
<p> The
terrain in the vicinity of our camp appeared to consist of two types ,
conglomeratic sandstone to the west and weak, likely shale-dominated rock to
the east on a flat spur top. The canopy on both terrain types near our camp
appeared to be dominated by Red Spruce as well as the same deciduous species as
are present in the Scenic Area. Red Spruce saplings and large seedlings were
abundant and vigorous appearing, but small seedlings that reflect current
reproduction, were hard to find and 
virtually confined to down bole &quot;nurse trees&quot;. An attempt was
also made to find White Ash and/or its seedlings, but without success.
Extraordinarily abundant here was Shining Clubmoss as well as blooming
Partridge Berry and very vigorous appearing Sweet-scented Bedstraw. Leaders of
Red Spruce in the open showed new growth increments of up to a foot  (0.3 m) 
or more, but those in the understory exhibited much less.
<p> A
sample was taken immediately east of Camp from a depth of 2-3 inches in tan,
clay – rich soil beneath a two inch mor layer. This sample  (no 2)  had pH=
4.5, a value consistent with the generally acidiphile flora. It is likely that
acid leaching was effective enough on this flat spur top to yield a flora not
much different from that which developed on conglomeratic sandstone
terrain.Fauna noted on our arrival and frequently thereafter included Veery,
Hermit Thrush, Red-eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo 
olivaceus</i>) and Black-throated Blue Warbler (<i>Dendroica caerulescens</i>).  An additional
feature of the entire vicinity was the paucity of lepidoptera , which are such a conspicuous part of the fauna
of forests at lower elevations  (One fritillary butterfly was seen.).  The same
may in fact be said of insects in general to the point that we had mixed
emotions regarding even the virtual absence of biting flies and mosquitoes!
<p> In the evening, under partial
clearing, we walked down FR 27 toward the north and noted the large size and
generally superior form of the bordering Red Spruce as well as its abundant and
vigorous-appearing saplings. Accompanying 
it were large Black Cherry of equally superior form. It appeared that
Yellow Birch, Red Maple and Beech also did very well on the roadside, which appeared
to be in conglomeratic sandstone terrain. In one place there was a large patch
of blooming Pearly Everlasting (<i>Anaphalis 
margaritacea</i>) and , not far beyond, a Smooth Serviceberry with
almost ripe fruit. Additionally, in many places on the open road bank there
were patches of the same White Woodland Strawberry we were to see in the Scenic
Area, but here with much larger fruit
<p>Not far down the road from our camp there was a
substantial but temporary springbrook
with its flow swollen by the rain. A sample of its water yielded a pH of 4.6. 
It is difficult to attribute the acidity of this sample to the rocks from which
it flowed however, since, through oversight, we failed to sample the rainwater
as well!.
<p>During the afternoon of 6-29-00 we traversed a
section of the 'Camp Trail' beginning at camp. Certain features near camp,
on the flat spur top, such as the most conspicuous vegetation and soil pH, have already been discussed. Now we
noted a number of large fallen trees with rootwads exposed in a blowdown ,
which offered a greater opportunity to observe the subsoil. This proved to be a
tan clay-rich material, possibly mudstone, with a few layers of what appeared
to be siltstone.
<p>Moving along the trail, the following species and
terrain features were successively observed: <i>Medeola</i>, abundant Shining
Clubmoss, an isolated patch of Tree Clubmoss ; then four Slate-colored Juncos,
much disturbed and flying at us and our dog, who chased them through the low
growth. These were followed by a Black-capped Chickadee, the same patterned
slug we had seen in the Scenic Area, the acidiphile and moisture-loving sedge <i>Carex intumescens</i>, a chocolate-colored soil or
mudstone, the fungus <i>Ustulina deusta</i>
and the liverwor<i>t Nowellia 
curvifolia</i> on a foot-diameter down bole.
<p>At about 1/5 mile  (0,3 km)  east of camp the trail turns northeast on a gentle
slope with a northwest aspect. Not far beyond this turn, near the remains of an
old building, we saw a number of curious, hitherto unobserved by us, almost perfect &quot;fairy rings&quot;
of Shining Clubmoss. Thse circles, which could not be related to any definite
feature, were of the order of a meter in diameter.
<p>We soon began to notice large isolated trees,
particularly of Red Spruce and Black Cherry, of excellent form, indicating
their attainment of maturity in a closed canopy setting. However, these old
growth giants stood in a matrix of largely Striped Maple up to six inches (
0.15 m)  dbh, which formed a sub-canopy.
<p>Not far beyond the foregoing there was a marked
change in forest type heralded by a large multistemmed Basswood. Soil near the
trunk of this tree appeared very rich in organic matter and a sample  (no 5) 
taken from a 2-3 inch depth had an initial pH of 5.8, but 28 hours later 6.6.
Here also were particularly impressive but widely spaced Black Cherry, very large
White Ash bearing the mosses<i>Neckera 
pennata</i> and <i>Anomodon 
attenuatus</i>, abundant Sugar Maple and very abundant seedlings of the
same, but only a few saplings of Red Spruce. Among herbs, blooming White Wood
Sorrel was widely distributed but not as abundant as in the Spruce forest.
Other herbs included stunted Blue Cohosh 
(<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i>
), a very little Virginia Waterleaf, also stunted , Intermediate Shield Fern,
Miterwort (<i>Mitella diphylla</i>) 
and White Hellebore (<i>Veratrum 
viride</i>) in moist areas. We then also identified at least some of
the basswood as American (<i>Tilia 
americana</i>) and noted the continued common occurrence of Beech, the
many small Indian Turnip, the fungus <i>Xylaria hypoxylon</i> and Nodding Fescue.
<p>At this point we took another soil sample  (no 6) 
from an upturned tree mound. This soil proved to be surprisingly acidic with an
initial pH of 4.5 and 28 hours later it had essentially the same value of 4.6.
The exposed position of this sample several feet above the forest floor may
have subjected it to intense acid leaching.
<p>Continuing along the trail, we saw Downy Many Knees
 (<i>Polygonatum pubescens</i>) , the forest bluegrass<i>Poa</i> <i>alsodes</i>; then Drooping Wood
Reedgrass, New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris 
noveboracensis</i>) , very abundant seedlings of Sugar Maple  (a feature
of this species characteristic of the northern forest) , more White Wood
Sorrel, the manna grass <i>Glyceria 
melicaria</i>, the forest grass<i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, abundant Beech and very common<i>
Tricholomopsis</i> <i>platyphylla</i>,
with this fungus frequently lined up on such objects as rotting down boles.
<p>Also apparent in this forest was the virtual absence
of mosses of the genus<i>Polytrichum</i> and other acidiphiles, and the common
occurrence of <i>Mnium affine</i>, <i>Thuidium delicatulum</i> and species of <i>Atrichum</i>
– all on soil – and unidentified species of <i>Hypnum</i> on down boles.
<p>Above a 
seepy swale occupied by White Hellebore and <i>Glyceria melicaria</i>, a slope bore Millet Grass (<i>Milium
 effusum</i>) and Ramps , both
in flower, Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria 
pubera</i>) , prominent White Ash, Oyster Mushroom (<i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>) on a Black Cherry down bole,
Beechdrops, a little Canada Mayflower and a single May Apple (<i>Podophyllum peltatum</i>) so stunted as to be hardly
recognizable and the only plant of its species seen by us in the entire region.
These were followed by the tiny fungus<i>Rickenella fibula</i> , characteristically in a bed of mosses , here
consisting of <i>Dicranum viride</i>
and <i>Mnium affine</i>; then Wood
Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>) , the root-bearing and
edible fungus <i>Xerula furfuracea</i>,
Mountain Oatgrass, the sedge <i>Carex 
debilis</i>, a ¾ inch  (2 cm)  coiled gastropod, and, as we terminated
our traverse, a toppled tree whose rootwad revealed a brown silt loam.
<p>Additional fungi collected on this traverse and
identified by R. Hunsucker are as
follows:
<p>
<i>Agrocybe 
acericola</i> – on rotting hardwoods.
<br><i>Amanita 
ceciliae</i>–
on soil.
<br><i>Amanita 
flavoconia</i> ––on mossy hardwood boles.
<br><i>Mycena 
haematopus</i> – on rotting hardwood.
<br><i>Pluteus 
flavofuligineus</i> – on rotting hardwoods.
<br><i>Polyporus 
radicatus</i> – on soil. n soil
<br><i>Collybia confluens</i> – on rotting hardwoods.
<br><i>Lactarius 
gerardii</i>
– on soil.
<br><i>Marasmius 
rotula </i>–
on dead Beech.
<br><i>Margenella subincarnata</i>- on mossy hardwood boles.
<br><i>Psatherella</i> sp. – on
rotting hardwoods.
<br><i>Ramaria </i> sp. – on
rotting hardwoods.
<br><i>Russula 
xerampelina </i> – on soil.

<h2>Gaudineer Knob</h2>
<br>
<b>Source
Walk: 5-24-97</b>
<ul>
<p>At 4309 ft  (1314 m)  asl,
Gaudineer Knob is the highest point in the vicinity. Bedrock consists of
Pennsylvanian New River and Kanawha Formations. The New River, which is mostly
sandstone, probably forms the summit. In any case, rocks exposed there are
coarse grained, almost coglomeratic, light gray sandstone. The grains in this
sanstone are very angular and brightly reflect sunlight, indicating little
reworking or recrystallization. The forest canopy from the base of the Knob to
and including the summit, particularly on the north slope, is almost pure Red
Spruce, although of immature age. An impression gained from the summit however,
is one of a greater deciduous component on other slopes.
<p> Our brief foray here consisted
of a circuit through the summit forest near the picnic area during late morning
and early afternoon under sunny, cool and pleasant conditions. The canopy
appeared to consist of more than 95 % Red Spruce in the the range of ten inches
 (25 cm)  dbh or less. Reproduction of Spruce seemed to be vigorous, with
mainly healthy-appearing seedlings and saplings visible even in dense shade,
although no attempt was made to determine the abundance of seedlings in the
size range of I-5 cm, which would have represented the current reproduction.
Canopy trees also appeared healthy. Observed understory consisted of Mountain
Holly and Mountain Ash (<i>Pyrus 
Americana</i>) , while shrubs such as Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifoia</i>) and Great Rhododendron (<i>
Rhododendron maximum</i>) appeared to
be confined to treefall gaps and areas of thin canopy. A single plant of
Southern Mountain Cranberry was observed growing on a large sandstone block.
<p> Ground cover under Spruce
consisted largely of a continuous 
bryopyte carpet, which also ascended tree bases. Dominant in many parts
of this carpet was the liverwort <i>Bazzania 
trilobata</i>, but species of <i>Hypnum, Polytrichum, Leucobryum</i> and
other mosses were also common. Intermediate Shield Fern was by far the most
common herb, but patches of Mountai Oatgrass, Canada Mayflower and yellow
Clintonia were also seen. Common Speedwell (<i>Veronica</i> <i>officinalis</i>) and Virginia Strawberry
 (Fragaria virginiana)  occurred along
paths. 
<p> It was noted that buds of
Cranberry and Mountain Holly had barely begun to swell and those of other woody
species appeared to be generally more retarded than even those on the Allegheny
Mountain summit at almost the same or slightly higher elevations.
<p> Although time did not permit
much observation of the Knob's fauna, we were offered a treat in the form of a
Hermit Thrush perched not 25 feet  (7.6 meters)  from us on a low bough and
characteristically cocking its tail and uttering its alarm clucks. Other animal
signs included calls of Red-eyed Vireos, a distant glimpse of a Tiger
Swallowtail Butterfly (<i>Papilio 
glaucus</i>) and a ten foot square area where bryophytes had been
grubbed up by some forager, perhaps a Black Bear (<i>Ursus americanus</i>). 
<p>

<p><h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<p>Throughout the area studied by us soils and
vegetation reflect bedrock and point to the necessity of considering geology in
the interpretation of the flora. This is as true for old growth forest as for
all younger stands  (Mueller and Mueller, 1997 ; Mueller, 1998).  Our
experience here is that, in ecological terms, remnant stands of old growth, as
those of forests in general, cannot be treated as units, and averaging
parameters such as pH, chemical element concentrations, soil sample
characteristics and species abundances from different microhabitats can lead to
gross errors in interpretation, particularly with respect to stability
relations and the occurrence of species and communities.
<p>Of some interest here is the apparent stunting and
failure to flower of a number of herbs. This effect appears to be confined to
the more nutrient demanding species that are characteristic of rich mesic
forests , while acidiphile species appear to be normal. R. Hunsucker has
suggested that these effects may be a consequence of the high precipitation in
the area, which is known to bring in pollutants. If so, the effect appears to
be largely confined to the vegetation itself rather than the soils, as these
show signs of only local acidification,as in the case of sample 6 , and otherwise
appear normal as to color, texture and organic matter content and in at least
two cases  (samples 4 and 5)  have pH
values compatible with a rich mesic flora. The deleterious effects of acid
precipitation and high ozone concentrations on vegetative parts of plants are
well known. Unfortunately time did not permit us to investigate such
possibilities in more detail.
<p>During our inventories we constantly bore in mind
the results and conclusions of Adams and Stephenson  (1989)  regarding the
decline of Red Spruce in the Central Appalachians. Since their growth ring data
indicate at least a recent decline, we sought other evidence for comparison. If
a decline is occurring at present we should find a diminution in the numbers of
small  (1 – 5 cm)  seedlings. While we have no base line data to compare ours
to, we found quite generally but few of such seedlings except at certain
locations as the tops of down boles and large exposed rock surfaces. While
larger seedlings and saplings were abundant, and this may have acted to
suppress seed germination in their vicinity, small seedlings were also
generally sparse on open mineral or duff-covered soil. Consequently we conclude
that Spruce decline might well be occurring at present and may result from some
of the same factors that lie behind the evident lack of vigor of certain herbs.
