<b>Source Walks: 9-19-97,9-20-97,9-21-97,9-22-97 and 10-9-97</b><p>
<b>Introduction</b><p><ul>
Most scenic of large rivers, the New, with its far-flung
tributaries and spectacular gorge, exerts its influence in all three
physiographic provinces of the Appalachians. Said to be the oldest river in
North America, it rises in North Carolina's Blue Ridge and cuts across the
entire Valley and Ridge and most of the Allegheny Plateau. Thus its waters
derive their nutrients from a wide variety of sources, including igneous,
metamorphic and sedimentary rocks,a feature, when combined with the great
diversity of aquatic and terrestrial habitats along its course, confers a
cosmopolitan character not possessed by lesser streams of the Central
Appalachians.<p>
	Rocks in the area inventoried are all sedimentary, near horizontal in the
attitude of their beds and consist of Mississippian Hinton Formation. While
this formation contains carbonate ( limestone and/or dolomite ) members, no
example of this rock type was seen in exposed bedrock. However some limestone
boulders were found in the River's bedload.<p>
	The inventories reported on here were almost entirely confined to the
confluence area of the New River and Glade Creek, a minor tributary that enters
the deep Gorge near Beckley West Virginia and within the New River Gorge
National River. Although the flora within the Gorge is southern Appalachian,
higher elevations ( 2500 feet/763 meters and over) along Glade Creek were once
covered by one of the largest White Pine forests in the State (Brooks 1910).<p>
	Our detailed inventories at the Glade Creek confluence consisted of the
following parts: (1) the campground area on a low sloping terrace,(2) a
traverse west of the campground along the base and lower part of a colluvial
slope and thence to the New River,(3) the wooded edge and strand along the
River west of the boat landing, (4) a traverse to the east of camp, crossing
the mouth of Glade Creek, through the boulder field along the River, then south
across the floodplain east of Glade Creek and (5) a traverse along the west
side of Glade Creek.<p></ul>
<b>Camp Terrace</b><p><ul>
	The camp terrace, which is elevated slightly in the center and slopes
toward Glade Creek and the River, has a very sandy surface soil. Several
measurements of this soil yielded pH values in the range of 5 to 5.5. The
terrace canopy is dominated by fairly large ( 2 ft/0.6 m dbh) Sycamore and
Tuliptree and smaller Black Locust, Sugar Maple, Yellow Buckeye,Black Walnut,
American Elm, Black Cherry of poor form, Northern Red and Black Oaks. A few
Beech also occur on the highest part of the terrace. Two Black Maple ( <i>Acer
nigrum </i>) near ten inches ( 25 cm ) dbh were noted in a parking space, where
they may have been related to the presence of limestone gravel. A similar
influence may also explain the presence of seedlings of Chinquapin Oak (
<i>Quercus muehlenbergii </i>) and several larger Boxelder ( <i>Acer negundo
</i>) seen along the campground road.<p>
	Spice Bush (<i> Lindera benzoin </i>) dominates the shrub layer in the
campground and Paw Paw (<i> Asimina triloba </i>) is abundant along its edges.
Ground cover under trees on the terrace was sparce, but included scattered
Plume Lily ( <i>Smilacina racemosa </i>), Sessile-leaved Bellwort ( <i>Uvularia
sessilifolia </i>), Bloodroot (<i> Sanguinaria canadensis </i>) and Big-leaf
Aster ( <i>Aster macrophyllus </i>). The alien cress<i> Cardamine impatiens
</i>was common along the campground road, while tall, vigorous White Snakeroot
(<i> Eupatorium rugosum </i>), Wingstem (<i> Verbesina alternifolia </i>) and
Virginia Knotweed ( <i>Polygonum virginianum</i> ) occupied openings.<p>
</ul>
<b>East-facing Colluvial Slope</b><p><ul>
	On our traverse along the base of the colluvial slope immediately to
the west of the campground, the following species and terrain features were
successively noted: Clearweed (<i> Pilea pumila </i>), Hispid Greenbrier (<i>
Smilax hispida </i>), Smooth Sweet Cicely ( <i>Osmorhiza longistylis </i>) as
identified by style, root and odor, abundant Paw Paw with green fruit, and
Spice Bush. Here also we identified a Spice Bush Swallowtail Butterfly (
<i>Papilio troilus </i>) feeding in White Snakeroot blossoms. Next recorded was
common, if not abundant Intermediate Shield fern ( Dryopteris intermedia ), a
species of Sanicle (<i> Sanicula  </i>sp ), Hooked Crowfoot ( <i>Ranunculus
recurvatis </i>), Summer Grape ( <i>Vitis aestivalis </i>), Nodding Fescue (
<i>Festuca obtusa </i>), abundant Christmas Fern ( <i>Polystichum
acrostichoides </i>), Wood Nettle ( <i>Laportea canadensis </i>), Delicate Fern
Moss ( <i>Thuidium delicatulum </i>) on sandstone, a small Silverbell tree (
<i>Halesia carolina </i>) with associated saplings, then by a two inch ( 5 cm )
long caterpillar with long, bright yellow hair punctuated by six pairs of tufts
of longer dark hairs. It was followed by that accepted indicator of rich soil
<i>Carex plantaginea</i>, then by Bitternut Hickory (<i> Carya cordiformis</i>
), Honewort ( <i>Cryptotaenia canadensis</i> ), Foam Flower ( <i>Tiarella
cordifolia </i>) and patches of bright green Tree Moss ( <i>Climacium
americanum </i>) with an associated species of <i>Atrichum</i>. The pH of soil
immediately beneath this patch of moss was 5.4. Next seen were Wild Stonecrop
(<i> Sedum ternatum </i>), Muscletree (<i> Carpinus caroliniana </i>),
Dutchman's Pipe vine ( <i>Aristolochia macrophylla)</i>, Northern Red Oak,
Broad-leaf Goldenrod ( <i>Solidago flexicaulis </i>) and Heart-leaved Skullcap
(<i> Scutellaria ovata </i>).<p>
	Now, at the base of a steep, west-trending slope northeast in aspect,we saw a
single Marginal Shield Fern (<i> Dryopteris marginalis </i>) plant, then
Maidenhair fern ( <i>Adiatum pedatum </i>), American Strawberry Bush (<i>
Euonymus americanus </i>), Black Cohosh (<i> Cimicifuga racemosa </i>), Great
Chickweed (<i> Stellaria pubera </i>), Sweet-scented Bedstraw ( <i>Galium
triflorum </i>) and a species of <i>Hypnum</i> moss. These species occurred on
or near a steep colluvial bank composed of rich-appearing reddish soil with a
measured surface pH of 5.4.<p>
	As we gradually ascended the colluvial slope, we noted an Avens (<i> Geum
</i>sp ), Yellow Buckeye, a large American Elm, White Ash, the first small
Beech, a Shagbark Hickory with thick-husked nuts and White Basswood. We also
noted that the soil beneath the Beech was light-colored and sandy. On
descending the rocky sandstone slope to the River, we encountered our first and
only Smooth Azalea (<i> Rhododendron arborescens </i>) accompanied by a little
Striped Maple (<i> Acer pensylvanicum </i>), Red Maple seedlings and finally on
the shore, River Birch (<i> Betula nigra </i>).<p></ul>
<b>New River Strand</b><p><ul>
	West of the boat landing the New River shore for some distance
consists of a fairly wide strand of sand that grades into the rocky forest
edge. Trees on this strand particularily include River Birch, Black Willow (<i>
Salix nigra </i>), Sycamore and Silver Maple (<i> Acer saccharinum</i> ), but
also such upland species as Sassafras, Black Gum, Persimmon (<i> Diospyros
virginiana </i>) and Redbud ( <i>Circis canadensis </i>) among others. Shrubs
too are well represented by Smooth Alder ( <i>Alnus serrulata </i>), Buttonbush
( <i>Cephalanthus occidentalis </i>), Glade St. Johns-wort (<i> Hypericum
densiflorum </i>), Winterberry Holly (<i> Ilex verticillata </i>), Black Haw
Viburnum (<i> Viburnum prunifolium </i>), Silky Dogwood (<i> Cornus amomum</i>
) and Ward's Willow (<i> Salix caroliniana </i>), with the latter most common
among large rocks of boulder strand however.<p>
	In places close to and merging with the forest edge were large patches of tall
grasses such as Big Bluestem ( <i>Andropogon gerardi </i>), <i>Chasmanthium
latifolium</i>, Yellow Indian Grass ( <i>Sorghastrum nutans </i>), Riparian
Wild Rye ( <i>Elymus riparius </i>), Switch grass ( <i>Panicum virgatum</i> )
and Deer-tongue Grass (<i> P. clandestinum </i>). Autumn Bent grass (<i>
Agrostis perennans </i>) was everywhere common, as to a lesser degree was
Spreading Witch Grass ( <i>Panicum dichotomiflorum </i>), Bush Panic Grass (
<i>P. dichotomum </i>), Slender-flowered Muhly (<i> Muhlenbergia tenuiflora
</i>), Wirestem Muhly (<i> M. frondosa </i>) and White Grass ( <i>Leersia
virginica )</i>.<p>
	Near the waters edge, on the strand, many small mat-like plants covered the
sand. These included Tooth Cup (<i> Rotala ramosior </i>),<i> Fimbristylis
autumnalis</i>, <i>Cyperus rivularis</i>, Creeping Lovegrass ( <i>Eragrostis
hypnoides </i>), the spikerush<i> Eleocharis obtusa</i>,  <i>Cyperus
inflexus</i>, Small-flowered St. Johns-wort (<i> Hypericum mutilum </i>), Marsh
Purslane (<i> Ludwigia palustris </i>) and Mud Plantain ( <i>Hederanthera dubia
</i>) in bloom. The first six of these are annuals.<p>
	The list of other plants growing on the strand is extensive. Identified
were:<p>

	<i> Rorippa </i>sp ( a cress )<br>
<i>Saponaria officinalis </i>( alien Soapwort )<br>
	<i>Ludwigia alternifolia </i>( Seedbox )<br>
	<i>Helianthus strumosus </i>( Pale-leaved Sunflower )<br>
<i>Acalypha rhomboidea </i>( Common Three-seeded Mercury )<br>
<i>Xanthium strumarium </i>( Hairybody Cocklebur )<br>
	<i>Epilobium coloratum</i> ( Purple-leaved Willowherb )<br>
<i>Solanum americanum </i>( Black Nightshade )<br>
<i>Echinochloa crusgali </i>( Barnyard Grass )<br>
	<i>Eleusine indica </i>( alien Goose Grass )<br>
<i>Commelina communis</i> ( Asiatic Dayflower )<br>
	<i>Chenopodium ambrosioides </i>(Mexican Tea )<br>
<i>Ranunculus hispidus </i>( Hispid Buttercup )<br>
	<i>Thalictrum</i> sp ( a Meadowrue )<br>
<i>Saururus cernus </i>( Lizards Tail )<br>
<i>Scutellaria lateriflora </i>( Mad-dog Skullcap )<br>
	<i>Onoclea sensibilis </i>( Sensitive Fern )<br>
<i>Eupatorium perfoliatum </i>( Boneset )<br>
<i>Hypnum</i> sp ( moss under tall sedges )<br>
<i>Lysimachia ciliata</i> ( fringed Loosestrife )<br>
	<i>Cardamine </i>sp ( very sharp-tasting species )<br>
<i>Helenium autumnale</i> ( Yellow Sneezeweed )<br>
<i>Apios americana </i>( Ground Nut )<br>
<i>Coreopsis tripteris </i>( Tall Coreopsis )<br>
<i>Solidago gigantea </i>( Late Goldenrod )<br>
<i>S.  canadensis </i>( Canada Goldenrod )<br>
<i>S.  rugosa </i>( Wrinkled-leaf Goldenrod )<br>
<i>Senecio aureus </i>( Golden Ragwort )<br>
	<i>Rudbeckia laciniata </i>( Tall coneflower ) and<br>
	<i>Boehmeria cylindrica </i>( False Nettle )<p>
	Aquatic species in the River itself were Large Water Starwort (<i> Callitriche
heterophylla </i>), Water Willow (<i> Justicia americana</i> ), Canada
Waterweed ( <i>Elodea canadensis </i>), the alien Curly Pondweed (<i>
Potamogeton crispus </i>) and Eel Grass ( <i>Vallisneria americana </i>) in
part pulled up by Muskrats (<i> Ondatra zibethica </i>). Mud Plantain occurred
here as well.<p>
	Where the sandy strand is pinched out by the rocky slope, mosses and leafy
liverworts hold sway on rocks and tree trunks. In particular, a species of the
liverwort <i>Porella  </i>ascends in thick encrustations up tree trunks to the
height of frequent flooding, perhaps six feet ( 2 m ) above the strand. Also
it, as well as <i>Anomodon</i> and <i>Mnium</i> mosses cover nearby rocks.<p>
	Many small fish, some apparently shiner minnows, were visible in the River,
and a fisherman exhibited two large ( 20 inch/0.5 m ) Channel Catfish (
<i>Ictalurus</i> <i>punctatus</i> ). Rafts of whirligig beetles ( <i>Gyrinidae
</i>) swirrled on the water surface, four inch ( 10 cm ) long, dark brown
Hellgramites (<i> Corydalis  </i>sp ) concealed themselves under rocks and
Belted Kingfishers (<i> Megaceryle alcyon </i>) chattered from the far shore.
The abundant and diverse aquatic life, which also included signs of Mink (<i>
Mustela vison</i> ), Osprey (<i>Pandion haliaetus </i>), Canada Geese (
<i>Branta canadensis </i>) and various ducks seemed to argue for near
circumneutral water. However a measurement taken just downstream from Glade
Creek yielded a pH of 6.0, a value that, if correct, may have been influenced
by the contribution from this tributary.<p>
	Special mention should be made of a plant characteristic of the the forest
edge east of the boat landing, where the sandy beech also pinches out and is
replaced by a boulder strand that extends eastward across the mouth of Glade
Creek and beyond. This plant is False Indigo (<i> Baptisia australis </i>),
which formed tall, conspicuous, dark green clumps and, at this season, bore
mature fruit pods. Other plants in the vicinity, but usually a little farther
from the water, were Pasture Rose ( <i>Rosa Carolina </i>), Coralberry (
<i>Symphoricarpos orbiculatus </i>), the dewberry <i>Rubus enslenii</i>,
Virginia Bushclover ( <i>Lespedeza virginica </i>), the alien Bushclover<i> l.
cuneata,</i> Crooked-stem Aster ( <i>Aster prenanthoides </i>), Common Evening
Primrose (<i> Oenothera biennis </i>), the Beggar Tick<i> Bidens cernua
</i>and New York ironweed ( <i>Vernonia noveboracensis </i>). A dead American
Elm bore the fungus <i>Poronidulus conchifer</i>  and nearby grew Winter
Mushroom ( <i>Flammulina velutipes </i>).<p></ul>
<b>East of Glade Creek</b><p><ul>
	On the morning of 9-20-97 the traverse was made from the campground
across Glade Creek toward the New River, with a return across the latter's
floodplain. Initially encountered on the approach to Glade Creek were a four
inch ( 8 cm ) dbh Silverbell Tree, Virginia Creeper (<i> Parthenocissus
quinquefolia </i>), Ebony Spleenwort ( <i>Asplenium</i> <i>platyneuron</i> ),
Alternate-leaf dogwood ( <i>Cornus alternifolia </i>), Blackhaw Viburnum,
Leatherwood (<i>Dirca palustris</i> ), a<i> Grimmia  </i>moss, the forest
grass<i> Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, Trailing Bushclover (<i> Lespedeza
procumbens </i>), Smooth Aster (<i> Aster laevis </i>) and Calico Aster (<i>
Aster lateriflorus </i>). Entering a very bouldery but forested area beyond
Glade Creek, we saw Fringe Tree (<i> Chionanthus virginica </i>), Wreath
Goldenrod (<i>Solidago caesia </i>), Arrowwood Viburnum (<i> Viburnum dentatum
</i>) and a small patch of Wild Stonecrop among moss in the shade of a large
rock. Then,at the edge of the boulder strand along the New River, there was
Indian Hemp (<i> Apocynum cannabinum </i>), low shrubs of Wards Willow,
Calingale (<i> Cyperus strigosus </i>), False Nettle, White Vervain (
<i>Verbena urticifolia </i>), Riverbank Goldenrod (<i> Solidago racemosa </i>)
and a species of the liverwort <i>Porella </i>on a rock. Now turning south
across the floodplain, we saw Wood Reed Grass (<i> Cinna arundinacea </i>) at
the forest edge,then under a canopy similar to that described earlier,a single
mature Chinquapin Oak, and nearby, a mature Hackberry ( <i>Celtis occidentalis
</i>). Particularly common here were American Elm and Spice Bush, with a
complement of tall herbs that included White snakeroot, Cup Plant
<i>(Silphium</i> <i>connatum </i>), Cardinal Flower (<i> Lobelia cardinalis
</i>) and Wrinkled-leaf Goldenrod. Because of its almost invariable association
with carbonate rock, the occurrence here of Chinquapin Oak is of interest, as
is the presence of Hackberry for the same reason. The elevation at the location
of these trees was of the order of ten feet ( 3 m ) above the River water level
and the root zone could be almost as far above the water table. The surface
soil under the Hackberry had a measured pH of 5.5, which, if accurate,
indicates considerable surface leaching here as well. However carbonate may be
present at depth. Our traverse ended a little beyond this point as light rain
began to fall.<p></ul>
<b>West Side of Glade Creek</b><p><ul>
	The morning of 9-21-97 was cool, but sunny, then became partly cloudy
as we began our traverse along the west side of Glade Creek. Our starting point
was near the occurrence of Blue False Indigo encountered on the previous
traverse. A spot inventory of the forest here at the edge of the New River
boulder strand, yielded the following: Sycamore, River Birch, White Ash,
Persmmon, Muscletree, Flowering Dogwood with abundant fruits, heavily consumed,
presumably by birds, Fringe Tree, Blackhaw Viburnum with unripe fruit,
Winterberry Holly, Buttonbush, Silky Dogwood, Nodding Onion ( <i>Allium cernuum
</i>), Golden Alexanders (<i> Zizia aptera </i>), the alien Annual Wormwood (
<i>Artemesia annua </i>), Autumn Bent grass and Delicate Fern Moss on
sandstone. <p>
	Then entering the rocky woods, we successively encountered Red Maple, the
first and only White Oak of our trip, Black gum, Muscletree, Persimmon,
Cucumbertree, a small patch of Spring Bluets, the alien Common Mugwort (<i>
Artemesia vulgaris </i>), Northern Red Oak and the medicinal Split-gill
Mushroom (<i> Schizophyllum commune </i>). Moving upstream, we saw Prostrate
Spurge ( <i>Euphorbia supina </i>), followed by several colonies of Shrub
Yellowroot (<i> Xanthorhiza simplicissima </i>). Associated with this
interesting medicinal plant were Persimmon, Muscletree, Winterberry Holly,
Golden Ragwort, Autumn Bent grass and the moss <i>Climacium americanum</i>.
Farther on we noted the fungus<i> Crepidotus applanatus</i>, a species of
<i>Dicranum</i> on a rock and an<i> Atrichum</i> on soil. Beaver sign was very
common, as it was also along the River.<p>
	We had been moving along the terrace edge, which had rock face exposures. Both
Tuliptree and Muscletree were abundant here and were accompanied by Spice
Bush,<i> Brachyelytrum</i> grass, Christmas Fern and<i> Carex plantaginea,</i>
indicating quite rich soil. Continuing onward along the base of the terrace and
rock faces, we saw the wood rush <i>Luzula acuminata</i>, the mosses
<i>Hedwigia ciliata</i>, <i>Aulacomnium heterostichum</i> and Apple
Moss(<i>Bartramia pomiformis</i> ),which with Red Maple, were all compatible
with acid soils. This acid trend was continued in an adjacent community of
Black Gum, Sassafras, Red Maple, Beech, Striped Maple, the first and only Great
Rhododendron(<i>Rhododendron maximum </i>) seen on our visit, Maple-leaf
Viburnum ( <i>Viburnum acerifolium </i>), Paw Paw, Partridge Berry (
<i>Mitchella repens </i>), also in its lone appearance, Smooth Rockcress (
<i>Arabis laevigata </i>) and Downy Solomons Seal or "Many Knees" (<i>
Polygonatum pubescens</i> )- all of which, excluding Paw Paw, are
characteristic of acid soils.<p>
	Only a little farther along the terrace base there was a community that
contrasted markedly with the above, it consisted of Yellow Buckeye, Sycamore,
Hackberry, Black Locust, saplings of Sugar Maple, Spice Bush, Paw Paw, Virginia
Waterleaf (<i> Hydrophyllum virginianum</i> ), Christmas Fern, Cut-leaf Grape
Fern ( <i>Botrychium dissectum</i> ), the mint<i> Meehania cordata</i> and the western species, Twin Grass (<i>Diarrhena americana</i>).
 Only a matter of 50 feet (15 m ) or so upstream we added Lady Fern (<i>
Athyrium filix- femina </i>), Foam Flower and Marginal Shield Fern to our tally
here.<p>
	<i>Meehania</i> is, with <i>Carex plantaginea</i>, regarded as generally
indicative of the richest ( eutrophic ) forest soils based on many inventories
( Rawinski, 1992 ). Twin Grass is rare in these mountains, but was
found previously by us at the Three Forks of the Williams River in the
Cranberry wilderness.<p></ul>

<b>Conclusions</b><p><ul>
	Of the 244 species of vascular plants identified near or upstream
from the New River/Glade Creek confluence, 19 were trees and 22 shrubs. Ferns
were neither diverse nor abundant in the area. Among mosses,no Haircap (<i>
Polytrichum </i>) species were observed, perhaps in keeping with the only
modest acid levels in the soil. Also attributable to this characteristic is the
absence of <i>ericaceae</i>, the only exceptions being Great Rhododendron and
Smooth Azalea. Perhaps equally significant is the virtual absence, except for
scattered Chinquapin Oak and Hackberry and the one suspect occurrence of Black
Maple, of markedly calciphile species. Perhaps these characteristics are
attribuable to the strong moderating effect of this great river in areas
subject to its flooding. Because of expected vertical rainwater leaching, it
might be  thought that the measured pH values in the range of 5.5 for surface
soils would give way to higher values at depth. Indeed the presence of such
species as Black Walnut, Chinquapin Oak. Hackberry and other woody species
seems to argue for this conclusion. Although no exposures of carbonate rocks or
related soils were found in the areas inventoried, it is possible and even
likely that such rocks occur elsewhere in the Gorge. What appeared to be Black
Maple was seen at several places along the road to the campground and R.
Hunsucker reported Yellow-flowered Leafcup ( <i>Polymnia uvedalia</i>), a
calciphile, and Kentucky Coffeetree (<i>Gymnocladus dioica </i>) along the same
road.<p></ul>
