<p><h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<p> Hidden
Valley is a local segment of the Valley of the Jackson River, a bold Virginia
stream that for most of its course follows the strike of the folded
Appalachians, then curves east across the ranges to become the James at Clifton
Forge. Although scenic in a conventional sense, the Valley is a degraded
landscape. Part of the George Washington National Forest, the U S Forest
Service, in characteristic mismanagement, has prevented the Valley from
reverting to the rich alluvial ecosystem that is so rare on public lands.
Instead it has maintained much of it as hay fields, encouraged the invasion of
alien species and even allowed its desecration by a commercial bed and
breakfast – all land type uses already common on adjacent private lands.
<p> The Valley
is flanked on the northwest by Back Creek Mountain, which rises to 3708 feet (1141 m) asl and much smaller Little Mountain, while Cobbler and Warwick
Mountains frame it on the southeast. Elevations near the River range between
1700 and 1800 feet (519 and 550 m) asl.
<p> The oldest
rocks in the area are Upper Silurian and Lower Devonian limestones, sandstones
and shales. Somewhat younger is the Millboro Shale, also of Devonian age (Rader and Evans, 1993). For our purposes
the landforms may be divided into four
types:
 <li>Mountain slopes dominated by colluvial processes</li>
 <li>Incised
 tributary stream valleys under the influence of both colluvial and
 alluvial processes</li>
 <li>Gently-sloping
 terraces with old surfaces dominated by acid leaching modified by
 upwelling ground water</li>
 <li>Major
 flood plains and low terraces along the Jackson River which are dominated
 by alluvial processes</li>
<p>Each of these land forms has its characteristic floras and a number of
these are 
<p>confined to specific landforms.
<p> Quite
generally deep-seated ground water and large streams fed by this ground water
have the highest pH and nutrient values and these are expressed in the rich
floras of the flood plains and colluvial slopes where these waters find ready
egress. Quite different conditions prevail on the high, relatively undissected
terraces which have prevailingly leached and acid soils but which in the spring
also experience limited groundwater upwelling.
<p> The
Virginia Natural Heritage Program  (Fleming, 1999)  has established several
test plots on rich limestone colluvial slopes of the River bluffs near the
right  (northwest)  bank of the Jackson River. Reported on are dry, dry-mesic
and rich cove/ mesic slope forests. Here we report on inventories of some of
these as well as other types. An unfortunate feature of some of these forest
types is the presence of dense populations of alien species.

<h2>Jackson River Flood Plain / Upland Forest Ecotone</h2>
<p>
<b>Source Walk: 5-3-00</b>
<ul>
<p>Beginning about 10:30 A M on 5-3-00, under almost
clear skies and warm temperatures, we traversed upstream along the right (
northwest)  bank of the Jackson River. Our traverse extended from the bridge
area for perhaps a mile  (1.6 km)  to where the River impinges on the base of
Little Mountain. Much of the traverse passed through the ecotone of the flood
plain and the upland forest. Species and terrain features are discussed here in
the order in which they were encountered.
<p> We
were immediately struck by the overwhelming abundance of the alien Multiflora
Rose (<i>Rosa multiflora</i>) and the
common occurrence of Black Walnut. The sighting of Goldfinch (<i>Spinus tristis</i>) and the calls of Red-eyed
Vireo (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>) and
Spring Peepers (<i>Hyla crucifer</i>) 
were soon joined by the song of the American Toad (<i>Bufo americanus</i>).  Besides Black Walnut other common species were Northern Red and
Black Oaks and the alien shrub Autumn Olive (<i>Elaeagnus umbellata</i>). These were soon followed by
our sighting a Blue –gray Gnatcatcher (<i>Polioptila caerulea</i>) and the calls of the Rufus-sided Towhee (<i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus</i>) and White-eyed Vireo
(<i>Vireo griseus</i>),  then by the
appearance of Bitternut Hickory (<i>Carya 
cordiformis</i>),  a lover of
rich soils. Joining it was Black Cherry of the usual poor form, Black Haw
Viburnum (<i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>) 
in full bloom and American Hazelnut (<i>Corylus americana</i>). 
<p> We
now arrived at a small springbrook which crossed the trail and from which a
water sample was collected. While the determination was somewhat uncertain, a
pH value of approximately 6 was obtained for this water. Not far beyond the
springbrook we encountered a small outcrop of black fissile shale, likely
Millboro. Also seen here were a Silver-spotted Skipper (<i>Epargyreus clarus</i>),  the alien plant Motherwort (<i>Leonurus cardiaca</i>),  an unidentified Wild Rye (<i>Elymus
</i> sp)  and possible Oswego Tea (<i>Monarda didyma</i>). 
<p> The next
rock seen was an outcrop of recrystallized chert, followed by one of sandstone.
Decorating the site was Small-flowered Phacelia (<i>Phacelia dubia</i>) in bloom and nearby, Shagbark
Hickory. On the adjacent River bank was a large Hackberry (<i>Celtis</i> <i>occidentalis</i>) and small American
Elm, while the trail-side bore the aliens Garlic Mustard (<i>Alliaria officinalis</i>),  Ground Ivy (<i>Glechoma hederacea</i>) and Self-heal (
Prunella vulgaris)  and the forested
slope, <i>Carex laxiflora</i>.
<p> We
soon came to a conspicuous terrain feature in the form of a large chert ledge
which eventually formed a 20 foot  (6 m)  – high overhang. Here were the alien
bittersweet <i>Celastrus orbiculatus</i>,
Starry Campion (<i>Silene stellata</i>
), Bladdernut (<i>Staphylea trifolia</i>) 
in full bloom, a little Catnip (<i>Nepeta 
cataria</i>),  Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>),  <i>Carex 
oligocarpa</i> and more American Elm. Conspicuous in the fine dust
beneath the overhang were numerous pits of antlions  (Myrmeleontidae). 
Following next were Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea arborescens</i>) and on chert, Short-leaved Bluegrass (<i>Poa cuspidata</i>) and Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum acerifolium</i>).  Here also, as along our
route in general, we had been seeing abundant blooming Striped Violet (<i>Viola striata</i>) and less frequent Downy Wood
Violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>).  Also
seen here were Tall Coneflower (<i>Rudbecia 
laciniata</i>),  Wild Ginger (<i>Asarum canadense</i>) and Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>).  An additional feature of
interest at the rock overhang, at a height of about eight feet, was an
accumulation of leaves and other debris that may have been a sign of the
Eastern Wood rat (<i>Neotoma floridana</i>
).
<p> Next
noted were May Apple (<i>Podophyllum 
peltatum</i>),  Prickly Gooseberry (<i>Ribes cynosbati</i>),  Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus radicans</i>) and what, from partly unfolded leaves, appeared to
be seedlings of Black Maple (<i>Acer 
nigrum</i>),  which hinted at the presence of carbonate in the vicinity.
These were followed by Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>),  a Red-spotted Purple Butterfly (<i>Limenitis arthemis 
astyanax</i>),  a Tiger Swallowtail (<i>Papilio glaucus</i>),  Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>),  Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>) and, on a rich slope,
blooming Large-flowered Trillium (<i>Trillium</i> <i>grandiflorum</i>) and Wild Geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>). 
<p> Continuing,
we saw Variable Panic Grass (<i>Panicum 
commutatum</i>),  Bloodroot (<i>Sanguinaria canadensis</i>),  Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>) and, on the open River
bank, the alien Dame's Rocket (<i>Hesperis 
matronalis</i>) in bloom. On the adjacent slope were Muscletree (<i>Carpinus caroliniana</i>) and a shaggy pignut,
likely <i>Carya ovalis</i>.
<p>Here, as quite
generally, the River bank was heavily overgrown by Multiflora Rose, but was
also populated by Black Walnut and Bitternut Hickory,  and also quite generally
by Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus 
florida</i>) in bloom. Also noted were the calls of Indigo Bunting (<i>Passerina cyanea</i>) and Scarlet Tanager (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>). 
<p> The mountain slope some distance
above the trail bore scattered quite large White Pine, and the trailside, Wild
stonecrop (<i>Sedum ternatum</i>), 
Boott's Goldenrod (<i>Solidago boottii</i>
) and Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla 
simplex</i>).  Additional species seen here were the wood rush <i>Luzula multiflora,</i> Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria
 pubera</i>),  Canada Brome Grass
(<i>Bromus pubescens</i>) and a
soaring Turkey Vulture (<i>Cathartes 
aura</i>). 
<p> A little farther on we came upon a
chert outcrop that bore an unusual community for this part of the traverse,
namely the acidiphiles Upland Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>) and Rattlesnake Weed (<i>Hieracium venosum</i>).  Following there were saplings
of Sassafras, the sedge <i>Carex 
communis</i>, Field Pussytoes (<i>Antennaria</i> <i>neglecta</i>),  Arrow-leaf Aster (<i>Aster sagittifolius</i>) and, on sandstone, a
lichen of the genus <i>Sticta</i>.
<p> On the adjacent stream bank there
was Ninebark (<i>Physocarpus opulifolius</i>
) and on the nearby slope, a large Basswood (<i>Tilia </i> sp),  Virginia Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum</i>),  Wreath Goldenrod (<i>Solidago caesia</i>) and Early Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum dioicum</i>). 
<p>Near another
ledge of sandstone we came upon an extended bed of Large-flowered Trillium and
a little Wild Hydrangea and were saluted by numerous calls of the Scarlet
Tanager. Then in continued revelation of soil fertility, we saw Hispid
Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus hispidis</i>),  a small patch of the
calciphile Twinleaf (<i>Jeffersonia 
diphylla</i>) already forming seeds, more of the bittersweet<i>
Celastrus orbiculatus</i>, Canada
Bluegrass (<i>Poa compressa</i>) and
either Sugar or Black Maple.
<p>These were soon
followed by our first American Redstart (<i>Setophaga ruticilla</i>),  its bright flashes of
plumage and song emanating from characteristically heavy cover, here provided
by Multiflora Rose of the River bank.
<p>Continuing our
progress through this rich habitat, we came upon Broadleaf Goldenrod (<i>
Solidago flexicaulis</i>),  Northern
Red Oak and Sugar Maple and heard again numerous calls of the Scarlet Tanager.
<p>We now came to
where the River made a sharp bend to the right, while the trail retained its
proximity to the edge of the terrace. On the bordering upland we saw Ebony
Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium platyneuron</i>
) and on the terrace Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio</i> <i>aureus</i>) and both Dotted Thorn (<i>Crataegus punctata</i>) and Large-seeded Thorn (<i>C</i>. <i>macrosperma</i>).  Also seen here, as on
earlier occasions along the traverse, was an unidentified Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza</i> sp). 
<p>A soil sample (
no 4)  was taken here from a 2 – 3 inch  (5 – 7.6 cm)  depth. This sample was
surprisingly acidic, with an initial pH of 4.7 and 15 hours later still only
5.0. It may be that acid leaching is active on this terrace, unless overcome by
alluvial processes.
<p>As we crossed
the terrace here we heard American Toads singing with increasing volume ahead
.Then, approaching the foot of the mountain slope again, we explored the mouth
of a small shallow ravine, which was dominated by what, from its unfolding
leaves, appeared to be a single large Black Maple with numerous seedlings of
the same. In association with the Maple were Black Walnut of canopy size, a
sapling of Tuliptree, a Wild Crabapple (<i>Malus coronaria</i>) with rose-colored buds unfolding, Deer-tongue
Grass (<i>Panicum clandestinum</i>), 
American Trout Lily (<i>Erythronium 
americanum</i>),  tall Agrimony (<i>Agrimonia gryposepala</i>),  Wood Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>),  Sweet-scented Bedstraw (
<i>Galium triflorum</i>),  Black Haw
Viburnum, <i>Carex hirtifolia</i>, Wild
Stonecrop, Cutleaf Toothwort (<i>Dentaria laciniata</i>),  May Apple, Robin's Plantain
(<i>Erigeron pulchellus</i>) in
bloom, Allegheny Crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus 
allegheniensis</i>),  Allegheny Blackberry (<i> Rubus 
allegheniensis</i>) and Spice Bush. Several species on this list –
which is far from exhaustive – are calciphile indicators. Of added interest was
a Spice Bush Swallowtail Butterfly (<i>Papilio troilus</i>),  which apparently was depositing eggs on the Spice
Bush, although we found none. A Towhee was also heard here.
<p>A soil sample
 (no 1)  was taken from a depth of 2-3
inches  (5 – 7.6 cm)  near the trunk of the large Black Maple. This soil was
very dark, rich in organic matter and of low density. Values of pH obtained
initially for this sample fell in the range of 5.8 to 6.5 and 20 hours later
6.0 to 6.8. It is possible that this uncertainty is attributable to complex
organic reactions. It is also possible that some acid leaching occurred here,
although the higher values approach those expected for Black Maple.
<p>Continuing to
skirt the upland forest edge, we saw Wild Sage (<i>Salvia lyrata</i>),  a sapling of American Elm, the
alien Sweet Vernal Grass (<i>Anthoxanthum 
odoratum</i>),  Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium virginianum</i>),  numerous Black Maple and
Shagbark Hickory, some White Oak and White Ash. Heard here were Tufted Titmouse
(<i>Parus bicolor</i>) and
Red-eyed Vireo, followed by the observation of <i>Carex digitalis</i>, Sugar Maple,  Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i>),  Hairy Bedstraw (<i>Galium pilosum</i>),  the forest bluegrass <i>Poa alsodes</i>, Allegheny Blackberry and Horse
Gentian (<i>Triosteum</i> <i>perfoliatum</i>
). Small unidentified birds were common in the shrubbery, and the only Wood
Thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustelina</i>) 
of the day was heard.
<p>We now crossed a
small stream, Lime Kiln Run, rich in cobbles but with no visible water. Then on
the terrace once more, we noted Bitternut Hickory and several Cockspur Hawthorn
(<i>Crataegus crus-galli</i>) with
leaves just unfolding; then Wild Pansy (<i>Viola rafinesquii</i>) in bloom, Virginia Bluebells (<i>Mertensia virginica</i>) long past blooming, Shrubby
St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum 
spathulatum</i>) and Pale Indian Plantain (<i>Cacalia atriplicifolia</i>). 
<p>At this point we
arrived at the place where the mountain spur impinges on the River and the
terrace vanishes. Also the latter had become very sandy and bore a flora quite
different from that which had prevailed thus far. Species noted were Spring
Bluets (<i>Houstonia caerulea</i>), 
the wood rush <i>Luzula echinata</i>,
Wood Betony (<i>Pedicularis canadensis</i>
), Wild Vetch (<i>Vicia caroliniana</i>), 
Upland Low Blueberry, Deer Berry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i>),  Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>),  Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>),  Mockernut Hickory (<i>Carya tomentosa</i>) and Canada Hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>) apparently free of the
Adelgid. Rough-winged Swallows (<i>Stelgidopteryx ruficollis</i>) foraged above the River and a Belted Kingfisher
(<i>Megaceryle alcyon</i>) and
Magnolia Warblers (<i>Dendroica 
magnolia</i>) were also seen.
<p>A soil sample (
no 2)  taken from a depth of 2 – 3 inches initially yielded pH= 4.6 and 20
hours later pH= 4.8. It is likely that these low values, as also reflected in
the flora, are a consequence at least in part of the siliceous substrate
provided by the sandy soil.
<p>Beyond the terrace
remnant we left the River's edge and followed a woods road / trail up a gentle
slope into the upland forest. The bedrock here appeared to consist at least in
part of a dense quartzite which formed a ledge bordering the trail. It is
likely that this rock contributed some of the sand of the terrace remnant.
<p>The canopy here
was mature but young and consisted of Red and Sugar Maples, Chestnut Oak,
Shagbark and Pignut Hickories, Tuliptree, Black Birch and Basswood. Blooming
Flowering Dogwood formed an understory and azalea,  likely Flame (<i>Rhododendron calendulaceum</i>) was present. Herbs
included Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia 
perfoliata</i>),  Christmas Fern, Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>),  Roundlobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica americana</i>),  Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>),  White Clintonia (<i>Clintonia umbellulata</i>),  Great Chickweed in bloom,
Blue Cohosh, Wild Stonecrop. Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>),  Cutleaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago arguta</i>) and Ox-eye (<i>Heliopsis helianthoides</i>).  Soil was
yellowish-brown and was capped by a semi-mor. A determination of its pH yielded
an initial value of 5.0 and 15 hours later one of 5.1..
<p>The Virginia Natural Heritage Program has
established a test plot  (Fleming, 1999)  not far from our site discussed above
and just upslope. Ninety-one species of vascular plants were recorded for their
400 sq meter plot. Although our inventory was far less complete than theirs,
the species composition found by us is quite similar, given its limitations.
However they did not find Tuliptree, Basswood, Wild Stonecrop, Blue Cohosh or
Ox-eye,  which may be a consequence the higher slope position of their plot. Of
particular interest however, is the single Black Maple found in their plot, 
since it seems to imply the near proximity of carbonate in some form. An
identical pH value of 5.1 was obtained for a composite soil sample in their
plot.
<p>As we reached
the end of our traverse our dog attracted our attention by chasing a Wood Duck
(<i>Aix sponsa</i>),  which attempted
to lead him across the River from her ducklings, which had scattered on our
side. All was resolved by our calling him off. 
<p>Species noted on
our return were Black-throated Green warbler (<i>Dendroica</i> <i>virens</i>),  Catbird (<i>Dumetella carolinensis</i>),  more 
Redstart, a Red Admiral Butterfly (<i>Venessa atalanta</i>).  Spreading Chervil (<i>Chaerophyllum procumbens</i>) and Hooked Crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus recurvatus</i>). 
<p>Additional birds
seen in open areas along the River included the following:
<p>
Redwing
Blackbird (<i>Agelalus phoeniceus</i>) 
<br>Mourning Dove (<i>Zenoidura macroura</i>) 
<br>Tree Swallow (<i>
Iridoprocne bicolor</i>)

<h3>Jackson River Flood Plain</h3>
<p>
<h4>Source Walk: 5-30-00</h4>
<p><b> </b>Our
5-30-00 inventory of the Jackson River flood plain was a brief foray under
sunny skies and pleasant temperatures. Our first observations were made in the
vicinity of a Beaver pond not far above the bridge on the right bank. Here we
noted Silky Willow (<i>Salix sericea</i>
),  sedges dominated by <i>Carex 
gynandra,</i> <i>C. lurida</i> and <i>Scirpus validus</i>, Cow Lily (<i>Nuphar advena</i>), the rush <i>Juncus effusus, </i>
Brown Thrasher, Catbird, Yellow-billed Cuckoo (<i>Coccyzus americanus</i>),  Black-throated Blue
Warbler (<i>Dendroica caerulescens</i>), 
Spring Peepers and boisterous Green Frogs (<i>Rana clamitans</i>),  with American Toads suddenly chiming in.
<p> A
relatively dry part of the flood plain was dominated by Wingstem (<i>Verbesina
 alternifolia</i>) with abundant
meadow Garlic (<i>Allium canadense</i>
), Fowl Manna Grass (<i>Glyceria 
striata</i>),  Late Goldenrod (<i>Solidago gigantea</i>),  Coral Berry (<i>Symphoricarpos orbiculatus</i>),  Dame's Rocket, Green
Dragon (<i>Arisaema dracontium</i>) 
and numerous widely spaced young Black Walnut. A 1.25 inch  (3 cm) 
&quot;Dobson Fly&quot; (<i>Corydalus </i> sp)  with wings dark brown, strongly-veined, a band of white spots
on the forewing near the middle and smaller white spots near the tip; antennae
well developed; chewing mouth parts and weak flight, was also common.

<h2>High Terrace</h2>
<p>
<b>Source Walks: 5-29-00</b>
<ul>
<p> Where the
Jackson River swings west for close to 1.5 miles  (2.4 km), it has left a high
bordering terrace to the south. This terrace appears to be developed on
Millboro Shale, but its alluvial component is not clear from our studies. As a
land surface, including its soils, the terrace should be the oldest in the
area, since it has, from its formation perhaps hundreds of thousands or
millions of years ago, been subject to neither extensive erosion nor
deposition. It is however subject to vertical leaching from rainwater and
limited upwelling of groundwater that reaches the surface in seeps and
originates in more elevated areas to the south. These waters likely engage
carbonate strata and thus moderate the effect of acid leaching. Additionally,
there has also been some overland wash, especially during the period of
euroamerican settler deforestation and attempts at agriculture. A campground
has been established by the U S Forest Service on this terrace and much of our
inventory was conducted in its vicinity. Weather during our stay was dominated
by cool and cloudy conditions
<p> Although
mature, the terrace forest canopy is young. It appears to be of uneven age, but
few trees exceed 2 feet  (0.6 m)  dbh. Perhaps pointing to catastrophic land
use, the canopy contains abundant Scarlet Oak (<i>Quercus coccinea</i>).  However, White Oak appears
to be dominant. Black and Northern Red Oaks are not common except as seedlings.
Red Maple is common, but mostly as seedlings and small trees. White Pine is
scattered throughout and is among the largest trees, but it is also common as
seedlings. Other species are Black Cherry of the usual poor form, a little
Black Gum, very little Tuliptree, A few Black Birch, Sassafras, Sugar Maple and
Virginia Pine. The only hickory seen was Shagbark and its seedlings and small
saplings were widespread. White Ash, an important soil character indicator, was
almost confined to seedlings, and only a single seedling of American Basswood
was seen. A species of particular interest in the seep areas was Swamp White
Oak (<i>Quercus bicolor</i>), and it
attains a large size.
<p> Minor and
understory trees included healthy-appearing as well as more common diseased and
dead Flowering Dogwood, small hawthorn,  likely <i>Crataegus flabellata</i>, Muscletree, Alternate-leaf
Dogwood (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i>) 
and a single small Wild Crabapple at the roadside. Both Upland Low Blueberry
and Deerberry, the latter in bloom, were common shrubs, as was Black Haw
Viburnum. Other shrubs were Maple-leaf Viburnum, Pasture Rose (<i>Rosa carolina</i>),  Shrubby St. Johns-wort,
American Hazelnut, Maleberry (<i>Lyonia 
ligustrina</i>),  the alien Japanese Barberry (<i>Berberis thunbergii</i>) and Flame Azalea in bloom.
Both Poison Ivy and Virginia Creeper were common vines as well as ground cover.
Other vines included Common Greenbrier, Saw Brier (<i>Smilax glauca</i>) in dry areas and Hispid
Greenbrier (<i>Smilax hispida</i>) in
seep areas.
<p> Herbs found
in the upland forest near camp included the acidiphile tick-trefoil <i>Desmodium</i> <i> nudiflorum</i>, Wreath Goldenrod, Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>),  New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis</i>),  Christmas Fern,
Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>), 
usually under White Pine, isolated patches of Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens</i> sp)  with Nodding Fescue, Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa</i> <i>bracteata</i>),  Wild Geranium, May Apple
and Sensitive Fern (<i>Onoclea 
sensibilis</i>) in concavities, Carex 
blanda, Cut-leaf Grapefern (<i>Botrychium dissectum</i>),  Downy Yellow Foxglove (<i>Aureolaria virginica</i>),  Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila maculata</i>),  Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>),  Rattlesnake Weed in bloom,
Hairy Hawkweed (<i>Hieracium gronovii</i>), 
Mountain Bellwort (<i>Uvularia pudica</i>), 
Mealy Bellwort, White Wood Aster (<i>Aster 
divaricatus</i>), Poverty Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia spicata</i>),  Tall Coneflower, Leather-leaf
Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum coriacium</i>
), Hairy Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza 
claytoni</i>) and an unidentified milkweed(<i>Asclepias</i> sp). 
<p> Mosses seen
were Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium 
delicatulum</i>), <i>Mnium 
affine</i>, <i>Dicranum 
scoparium</i>, <i>Bryoandersonia 
illecebra</i>, <i>Atrichum 
crispum</i>, unidentified species of <i>Polytrichum</i> and <i>Dicranum</i>-all
on soil; <i>Rhynchostegium serrulatum</i>
on the base of a White Pine, <i>Ulota 
crispa</i> on Northern Red Oak, <i>Anomodon rostratus</i> on the base of a White Oak, and several
unidentified species of <i>Hypnum</i>. Few fungi but <i>Collybia dryophylla</i> were noted.
<p> A soil
sample  (no 5)  from a 2-3 inch depth under a thin mor was taken in the upland
forest. This soil proved to be rich in light gray silt with the appearance of
ash and did not form lumps on drying. Beneath the mor layer it was virtually
devoid of organic matter. A pH value of 4.5 was obtained both initially and 28
hours later. Associated plants were Teaberry, Rattlesnake Weed, <i>Potentilla simplex,</i> Partridge Berry, the moss <i>Dicranum
scoparium</i> and seedlings of Red Maple.
<p> Immediately
south of the campground there is a substantial seep or springbrook with a very
shallow channel. Soil from this seep was high in organic matter and had an initial
pH of 4.7 and the same value 28 hours later. On drying this soil divided into
two components. The minor component consisted of a light gray ash-like silt and
the major component consisted of hard dark lumps that could not be broken with
the fingers. It is likely that this is a mixture of clay and organic matter
that was originally in colloidal form. By contrast the seep water had a pH of
5.5, perhaps indicating that this water had been in contact with more alkaline
material at depth and beneath the zone of acid leaching. It is possible that
nearby limestones were involved.
<p> The flora
in the seep vicinity was dominated by large and small Swamp White Oak, White
Oak and Red Maple. A few small Sugar Maple were also seen, Shrubs noted were
Winterberry Holly (<i>Ilex 
verticillata</i>),  Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>),  Black Haw Viburnum,
American Hazelnut, Pasture Rose and the
hawthorn <i>Crataegus</i> <i>flabellata</i>,
Associated vines were Virginia Creeper, Poison Ivy, Summer Grape, Virgin's
Bower (<i>Clematis virginiana</i>), 
the dewberry <i>Rubus flagellaris</i>
and possibly <i>R. enslenii</i> as
well. Although Maleberry was not seen at the seep, it was present in the nearby
forest, perhaps reflecting a generally high water table.
<p> A feature
of the springbrook bank was the abundance of Tree Moss (<i>Climacium</i> <i>americanum</i>),  frequently in close
association with the moss <i>Bryoandersonia illecebra</i>. Also abundant were Stiff Marsh Bedstraw (<i>Galium obtusum</i>),  Northern Swamp Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus septentrionalis</i>),  and Wood Anemone.
Other common species were Cowbane (<i>Oxypolis rigidior</i>),  Riddell's Hedge 
Nettle (<i>Stachys cordata</i>
), the manna grass <i>Glyceria 
melicaria</i>, Crooked-stem Aster (<i>Aster prenanthoides</i>),  Water Speedwell (<i>Veronica anagalis-aquatica</i>),  Hog Peanut, <i>Carex typhina</i>, Riparian Wild Rye (<i>Elymus riparius</i>),  Wild Liquorice (<i>Galium circaezans</i>),  Enchanter's Nightshade, a
jewelweed (<i>Impatiens </i> sp), 
Downy Wood Violet, Indian Cucumberroot (<i>Medeola virginiana</i>),  a Sneezeweed (<i>Helenium
</i> sp),  Virginia Snakeroot (<i>Aristolochia
 serpentaria</i>),  <i>Potentilla simplex</i>, an unidentified <i>Habenaria</i>
orchis, Squaw Weed (<i>Senecio 
obovatus</i>) and May Apple. A little Virginia Knotweed (<i>Polygonum virginianum</i>) was seen at the edge of
the community. There were also several patches of unidentified <i>Sphagnum</i>
moss in wetter areas and several species of <i>Hypnum</i> were present as well.
The moss <i>Anomodon attenuatus</i>
occurred on trunks of Swamp White Oak.
<p> Also seen
in the general vicinity were Common Speedwell (<i>Veronica officinalis</i>),  Bushy Panic Grass  (<i>Panicum 
dichotomum</i>, Wild Lettuce (<i>Lactuca canadensis</i>),  Yarrow (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>),  the moss<i>
Dicranum scoparium</i> and the fungi <i>Trichaptum biforme</i> and Devil's Urn (<i>Urnula craterium</i>). 
<p> A loop
traverse was now made from the seep area toward the east and return, bearing
left. Species successively noted were common mature White Pine, Spotted
Wintergreen, Cut-leaf Goldenrod, quite common and very glaucus <i>Carex laxiculmis</i>  (said by Strausbaugh and
Core  (1977)  to characterize &quot;rich woods&quot;),  Poverty Oat Grass,
Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia 
quadrifolia</i>),  Pume Lily,
Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed, Canada Bluegrass, Variable Panic Grass (<i>Panicum commutatum </i> var <i> barbulatum</i>), 
Plantain-leaf Pussytoes (<i>Antennaria 
plantaginifolia</i>),  generally quite abundant May Apple and White Oak,
<i>Carex gracilescens</i>  (also,
according to S and C, a product of 
&quot;rich woods&quot;),  Deer Berry, Yellow Star Grass (<i>Hypoxis hirsuta</i> 
) in bloom, Rattlesnake Weed, also in bloom, Downy Serviceberry, New
York Fern, the moss <i>Mnium cuspidatum</i>,
Mealy Bellwort, Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel, a &quot;gall-of –the Earth&quot; (<i>Prenanthes
</i> sp),  Teaberry, abundant seedlings
of Red Maple, more <i>Carex laxiculmis</i>,
Panicled Hawkweed (<i>Hieracium 
paniculatum</i>),  Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, an unidentified <i>Mycena</i>
fungus, the moss <i>Dicranum fulvum</i>
on sandstone, Four-leaved Yam, <i>Carex gracillima</i>, a single Tuliptree, then a multistemmed Sugar
Maple sapling with etiolated leaves, followed by Multiflora Rose, <i>Carex amphibola</i>, Sensitive Fern, the fungus <i>Psathyrella delineata</i> on hardwood debris, the moss <i>Leucobryum albidum</i>, White Grass (<i>Leersia virginica</i>) and Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus</i>),  both in a moist spot, the
wood rush <i>Luzula multiflora </i>and
the mint <i>Stachys cordata</i>. Other
sedges collected on the traverse and identified by R. Hunsucker were <i>Carex complanata</i>, <i>C</i>. <i>wildenowii</i>, <i>C. rosea, C. 
radiata, C</i>. <i> blanda </i>and
<i>C. cephalophora</i>.
<p> Although it
remained overcast all day, the calls of Ovenbirds (<i> Seiurus aurocapillus</i>) were incessant in this forest. In general
ground cover was quite heavy throughout, particularly by Virginia Creeper,
Poison Ivy and May Apple, in concavities and moist areas.  Shrubs were less
conspicuous but omnipresent. No Chestnut Oak was recorded, which may be a
consequence of low relief and a high water table as indicated by the presence
of seeps and Swamp White Oak. White Ash appeared to be virtually confined to
seedlings, perhaps as a consequence of generally high acidity of the soils.
Also Tuliptree has only a scattered occurrence, which is more difficult to
explain. There is an interesting contrast between this forest and that along
Potts Creek at the Steel Bridge Campground of the Jefferson National Forest (see
<a href=potts.htm>our section on Potts Mountain</a>), The latter appears to be less acidiphile,
with less Teaberry and common White Ash, but exhibits a sparse ground cover,
perhaps as a result of access to rich fluvial deposits but more dissected
terrain.
<p> During the
evening of 5-29-00 numerous small birds, some of which were unidentified
warblers, were seen foraging in the crowns of Scarlet Oak at Camp. Heard after
7:00 PM were the calls of Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Ovenbird, Spring Peeper and
Gray Tree Frog (<i>Hyla versicolor /
chrysocelis</i>).  A Ruby-throat Hummingbird (<i>Archilochus</i> <i>colubris</i>) was also seen. Other birds
seen and/or heard throughout the day were Great Crested Flycatcher (<i>
Myiarchus crinitus</i>),  Pileated
Woodpecker (<i>Dryocopus pileatus</i>
), Wood Thrush, Catbird, American Robin, Mourning Dove and Turkey Vulture.

<h2>Ravine Traverse</h2>
<p>
<b>Source Walk: 5-30-00</b>
<ul>
<p><b> </b>On
the morning of 5-30-00, sunny, bright and cool, we conducted an inventory of
the small stream valley immediately east of the Campground. This stream
originates in a hilly area to the south. The valley in in the vicinity of our
inventory is a steep-sided ravine, but the rapidly-flowing stream is flanked by
a number of small terraces. A black fissile shale, likely Millboro, is exposed
in the stream bed. The lower course of the stream is through open fields on the
sloping terrace, but that above the campground road, in the vicinity of our
inventory, is forested.
<p> On entering
this forest, just above the road, one is struck by a number of tall mature, but
quite young White ash. Associated with the Ash were a few quite large  (~ 23
inch / 0.58 m)  dbh Black Walnut, Black Cherry of poor form and small American
Elm.
<p>Shrubs noted were Spice Bush, Blach Haw Viburnum, Witch
Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i>) 
and Wild Plum (<i>Prunus Americana</i>
). Poison Ivy, Virginia Creeper, Common and Hispid Greenbriers were vines
recorded.
<p> Testifying
to soil fertility was a diverse herb flora, which here included Wingstem, Tall
Agrimony, May Apple, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Nodding Fescue, Canada Brome
Grass, Honewort, Striped Violet in bloom, Variable Panic Grass, Late Goldenrod
(<i>Solidago gigantea</i>),  abundant
Wild Stonecrop, Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium virginianum</i>) and a wild rye (<i>Elymus </i> sp).  The only fungus noted here was <i>Ustulina deusta</i>, which is common on the decaying
roots of Beech maple and ash, and Catbird was the only bird identified
<p>Continuing up-ravine we saw in
succession the first of the forest bluegrass<i>Poa alsodes</i>, Black Cohosh, Northern Red and White Oaks,
Thimbleweed, (<i>Anemone virginiana</i>
), <i>Carex hirtifolia</i>, Virginia
Knotweed, Hog Peanut, Cockspur Hawthorn, <i>Carex </i> g<i>racillima</i>, Squaw Weed, Virgin's
Bower, Indian Turnip, <i>Carex 
digitalis</i>, Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel; then Crooked-stem Aster, the
alien bittersweet <i>Celastrus orbiculatus</i>,
the ineptly-named natve 'Greek Valerian&quot; (<i>Polemonium reptans</i>) and Enchanter's Nightshade.
<p> We
now encountered a small patch of the State-listed Great Indian Plantain (<i>
Cacalia muehlenbergii</i>),  followed
by Lance-leaf Wild Liquorice (<i>Galium</i> <i>lanceolatum</i>),  Great Chickweed, the forest grass<i>
Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, Stiff Marsh
Bedstraw, some mating crane flies, Downy Serviceberry, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (
<i>Solidago rugosa</i>),  Bottlebrush
Grass, Wild Geranium, Slippery Elm, Virginia Strawberry and some dying
Flowering Dogwood. In a moister area near the stream, were Skunk Cabbage (<i>Symplocarpus foetidus</i>),  Silvery Glade Fern (<i>Athyrium
 thelypterioides</i>),  Sensitive
Fern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>) and
White Grass. Nearby was a Sugar Maple sapling with its underleaf resembling
that of Black Maple; then False Nettle (<i>Boehmeria cylindrica</i>),  Allegheny Crowfoot and small Red Maple
seedlings. 
<p> Next
seen was White Pine, followed by<i>Carex 
prasina</i>  (according to S and C, characteristic &quot;of wet woods
and thickets&quot;),  then a beautiful tall Shagbark Hickory,  greater than a
foot in diameter, and a single plant of Spotted Wintergreen. Attesting also to
the merging of habitats were Arrowleaf Tearthumb (<i>Polygonum sagittatum</i>),  Common Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum biflorum</i>),  the fungus <i>Collybia dryophylla</i>  (oak-loving <i>Collybia</i>) 
and,  again, Multiflora Rose.
<p> These
were followed by Wild Liquorice, <i>Carex 
cephalophora</i>, Robins Plantain, another Catbird, Winter Grape(<i>Vitis vulpina</i>),  an unidentified milkweed (<i>Asclepias
</i> sp),  Bitternut Hickory, Common
Speedwell, <i>Carex laxiculmis</i>,
Hophornbeam, a Red Maple sapling, Smooth Rockcress (<i>Arabis laevigata</i>),  Mealy Bellwort and, on the
stream bank,  Smooth Alder (<i>Alnus 
serrulata</i>) and a sapling of Sycamore.
<p> At
this point we saw numerous seedlings of White Ash, noting also the presence of
insect galls on their leaves. Present as well were an isolated Sugar Maple,
White Wood Aster and Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>).  A soil sample  (no 7)  taken here next to Mealy
Bellwort, was moderately rich in organic matter, and had a clay component as
indicated by hard lumps formed on drying, but also contained some sand and silt
as well. Initially obtained from this sample was a pH of 5.6, followed by the
same value 28 hours later.
<p>Recorded as we continued up-ravine
were Hairy Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza claytoni</i>),  Clustered Snakeroot (<i>Sanicula gregaria</i>),  another sapling of Sugar
Maple, the fungus <i>Mycena pura</i>
with a small slug attached; then an American Basswood sapling, followed by a
disporum, likely Hairy (<i>Disporum 
lanuginosum</i>),  American Hazelnut, <i>Carex</i> <i>pensylvanica,</i> Squaw Root (<i>Conopholus Americana</i>),  the fungus <i>Stereum ostrea</i>  (False Turkeytail),  Turtlehead
(<i>Chelone glabra</i>),  Hooked
Crowfoot, Daisy Fleabane (<i>Erigeron 
annuus</i>),  Deertongue Grass,<i>Carex amphibola</i> and Hairy Woodmint (<i>Blephilia hirsuta</i>). 
<p>On reaching the up-ravine
limit of our traverse we returned to
our origin by following the stream bed. A feature of this stream that was quite
apparent was the deposit of algae and other organisms on rocks in the bed. Also
apparent was the preponderance of sandstone in the bed load cobbles and larger
rocks, while no limestone was found among them. Water in the stream was found
to have pH=6.0. A soil sample  (no 8)  was taken from the bottom of the
vertical stream bank immediately above an exposure in the stream bed of black
fissile shale. This sample yielded pH= 5.3 initially and the same value 28
hours later. It appeared to be almost devoid of organic matter, and was notable
for its content of sand, although silt appeared to be a major component.
<p>Of some interest was the absence of
calls of the Ovenbird in this ravine forest, given their frequency in that of
the adjacent terrace.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
The
Hidden Valley Area offers outstanding examples of the relation between forest
types, bedrock geology, topography and hydrologic regimes.  It is rare that
high water tables are associated with otherwise dry, acidic forests in the
mountains. The Swamp White Oak community is unusual in this respect.
Contrasting with this community are the rich colluvial slope and ravine forests
associated with carbonate rocks. As concluded by the Virginia Natural Heritage
Program  (Fleming, 1999),  these too are rare on public lands. The present
condition of the flood plain and low terraces of the Jackson River is a
particularly sore point. In ecological terms it is an example of land abuse.
These bottomland habitats are also all too rare on public lands and play a
critical role in the regional ecologic mosaic. Region-wide ecosystems with a
complement of flora and fauna approaching that of the original system cannot be
established without them. This is particularly true of large mammals, birds and
certain aquatic forms. In terms of biologic productivity each acre of
bottomland is equivalent to a number of acres of upland forest. Consequently,
keeping the land in its present state for agricultural and cultural reasons
cannot be justified. It is too much of a premium as floral and faunal preserve.
At worst these lands should be allowed to revert to native vegetation that
would shade out most of the alien species, at best again to wilderness.
