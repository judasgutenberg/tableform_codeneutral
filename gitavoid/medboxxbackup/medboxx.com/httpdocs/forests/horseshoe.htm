<h1>Horseshoe Run / Dorman Ridge</h1>
<blockquote>




<br><b>November, 1999</b>
<br> 
<b>Source Walks: 7-12-96 and 7-13-96</b>
<ul>
<p> Horseshoe
Run, a tributary of the Cheat River, lies within the Allegheny Mountain
subprovince in Tucker and Preston Counties, West Virginia. The subject area of this report is located
at about 39 deg.10’ N along the Run a few miles southwest of the community of
Lead Mine. The watershed of Horseshoe
Run is almost entirely underlain by Devonian Chemung Group rocks consisting of
siltstones, sandstones and shales. 
However, the upper reaches of some tributaries also access other rocks
such as the Hampshire Formation, Mauch Chunk Group and most significantly, the
Greenbrier Limestone.
<p> The
forest in the study area consists dominantly of Allegheny hardwoods that can be
classified as mixed mesophytic, albeit in degraded form. However Lead Mine is known for what was
probably one of the largest trees ever cut in West Virginia, a more than 13 ft
(4.0 meter) dbh White Oak (Clarkson, 1964). 
Our initial and most thorough inventory was conducted at the Monongahela
National Forest Campground which is situated on the Horseshoe Run floodplain
just south of Bonifield Run. Although
the terrain here is almost flat, certain parts are elevated a few feet above
the average level. Of particular interest
is the base of the steep northwest-facing talus slope that borders the
floodplain on the southeast.
<p> The
canopy of the floodplain forest at the campground<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> is dominated by large White Pine
and Hemlock. Coring of these conifers,
some of which exceed 3ft (0.9 meters) dbh, revealed them to be 80 to 100 years
of age with Hemlock perhaps the oldest. 
Co-dominant deciduous species here are Tuliptree, Yellow and Black
Birches, Sugar and Red Maples, White Ash, Shagbark Hickory, Northern Red and
White Oaks, Beech and Sycamore, with the last-named concentrated along the
stream. Only one small Black Gum was
seen. Muscletree is the most common
understory species although Hawthorn (<i>Cratægus</i>
sp.) is also abundant and there is a little Striped Maple as well. The most common shrub in the vicinity of the
conifers is Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron
maximum</i>), but Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis
virginiana</i>) and Spice Bush (<i>Lindera
benzoin</i>) are abundant in association with deciduous canopy. Some Elderberry (probably <i>Sambucus canadensis</i>) also occurs in
moist areas.
<p> Underneath the large
pines and hemlocks that occupy the slightly elevated areas, Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>) and Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>) and a little
Palmate-leaved Violet (<i>Viola palmata</i>)
constitute virtually the only ground cover, reflecting the leached and
acidified soil there.
<p> The
concentration of herbaceous plants at the base of the northwest-facing talus
slope indicates a far more favorable and less acid environment than under the
conifers. It is characterized by
abundant Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>),
Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata</i>),
Smooth Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza
longistylis</i>), Wild Stonecrop (<i>Sedum
ternatum</i>), Clearweed (<i>Pilea pumila</i>),
Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i>),White
Baneberry (<i>Actea pachypoda</i>),
Enchanters Nightshade (<i>Circæa
quadrisulata</i>), Creeping Phlox (<i>Phlox
stolonifera</i>), Indian Turnip (<i>Arisæma
triphyllum</i>), Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria
pubera</i>), the sedge <i>Carex laxiflora</i>,
May Apple (<i>Podophyllum peltatum</i>),
Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>),
Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>),
Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens</i> sp.), White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium rugosum</i>), White Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis montana</i>), a managrass (<i>Glyeria</i> sp.), Viriginia Knotweed (<i>Polygonum virginianum</i>), Wild Ginger (<i>Asarum canadense</i>), Bottlebrush Grass (<i>Hystrix patula</i>), Deer-tongue Grass (<i>Panicum clandestinum</i>) and Meehania (<i>Meehania cordata</i>). Ferns include luxuriant stands of Silvery
Athyrium (<i>Athyrium thelypteroides</i>),
abundant New York (<i>Thelyptris
noveberacensis</i>) and Hay-scented (<i>Dennstædtia
punctilobula</i>) as well as Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>) and Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>). Sugar Maple seedlings are abundant and
Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus
quinquifolia</i>) is a common vine.
<p> An
equally rich if somewhat different flora occurs at other places on the flood
plain. Especially notable in more open
areas are rich stands of Crooked-stem Aster (<i>Aster prenanthoides</i>), Wingstem (<i>Verbesena
alternifolia</i>), Pale Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens
pallida</i>), Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel(<i>Oxalis
stricta</i>), Broad-leaved Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum
canadense )</i> and the sedges <i>Carex
plantaginea</i> and <i>C. scabrata</i>. Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus radicans</i>)
is abundant everywhere.
<p> The
presence here of several species such as<i>Meehania</i> and<i>Carex
plantaginea</i> -which are<i></i>usually
associated with rich soils- as well as the general character of the flora, hint
at nutrient sources other than those in the Chemung Group rocks. The diversity revealed by this cursory
inventory indicates that a much greater tally would result from a complete
growing season study. Also the
occurrence of such northern/high elevation species as Yellow Birch, Striped
Maple, Canada Mayflower and White Wood Sorrel point to the influence of cold
air drainage/accumulation along the valley flat.
<p> On
7-13-96 a climbing traverse was made up up a spur of Dorman Ridge along the
Losh Trail, beginning at the Trail stream crossing immediately north of the
YMCA Camp. The first part of theTrail
lies along the floor of the ravine of Losh Run, then ascends the northeast side of the ravine .The total elevation
change on this traverse was about 600 ft (180 meters). Passage is through a dominantly young to
mature acid-mesic forest but ends on a somewhat dryer ericaceous spur
crest. Soils are generally of the mull
type but not particularly rich-appearing. 
However no mor soils were seen.
<p> Diminution
of diversity and luxuriance of plant life is immediately apparent along the
ravine bottom as compared with the Horseshoe Run flood plain. The canopy here consists of Black Birch,
Hemlock, White Pine, Shagbark Hickory and Beech with abundant Northern Red Oak
seedlings. A single large (10 inch/25
cm dbh) Sourwood (<i>Oxydendrum arboreum</i>)
was also seen here. Witch Hazel is the
prevailing shrub and Ground Berry (<i>Rubus
hispidus</i>) shares moist areas with Northern Bugelweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus</i>), Sensitive Fern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>) and Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>). 
The only identified grass was Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>). A White
Pine remnant of an older forest with a 40 inch (1 meter) dbh yielded a minimum
age of 120 years on coring. A large grape vine (probably Summer Grape ) festooned a tree in the area.
<p> In
what follows new species for the area or those of particular interest or
significance, are listed in the order in which they were encountered on the
climb up the spur, Scientific names are given only for species not previously
listed. Thus not far above the ravine
bottom we noted that moist acid-soil familiar Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana</i>) followed by New York
Fern, American Chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>)
sprouts, Great Rhododendron, White and Scarlet Oaks, <i>Leucobryum</i> cushion moss at
tree bases, abundant Hemlock, Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>), Black Birch, Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>), Moccasin Flower (<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>) and, at perhaps 1900
ft (580 meters) asl, the first Striped Maple since those seen on the
floodplain. Above this we noted
Virginia Creeper, Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium
virginianum</i>) and Round- lobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica
americana</i>). In this first section
of the ascent the rather dry acidic forest, as reflected in the flora, resulted
in a rather thick leaf mat. Now
however, at perhaps 2000 ft (610 meters), there was apparently a transition to
somewhat more mesic conditions with the appearance of American Basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>), Round-leaf Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia</i>), Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum lanuginosum</i>), White Wood Aster
(<i>Aster divericatus</i>), Horse Balm (<i>Collinsonia canadensis</i>), Four-leaved Yam
(<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>), Wild
Liquorice (<i>Galium circæzans</i>), Wild
Stonecrop, White Snakeroot and Summer Grape (Vitis æstivalis). A little beyond this transition a spot
inventory of the canopy included White Oak, Beech, Red Maple, Black Birch,
Cucumbertree, Scarlet Oak and Tuliptree. 
Not far above this a cored 30 inch (76 cm) dbh Northern Red Oak was
estimated to be 85 years old. No doubt
this exceeds the average stand age for this slope forest.
<p> Then
on approaching the upper ravine floor and the crossing of Losh Run, with
associated springy ground at perhaps 2000 ft (610 meters) asl, there was an
observed increase in Hemlock, Black Birch, Beech, Great Rhododendron and the
incidence particularly of Round-leaved Violet. 
Here also we noted the sedge <i>Carex
laxiflora</i>, Broad Beech Fern (<i>Phegopteris
hexagonoptera</i>) and in a spring, <i>Carex
scabrata</i>.
<p> Few
birds attracted our attention on this climb except the ever-present Red-eyed
Vireos (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>) and, at this height, Scarlet Tanagers (<i>Piranga 
olivacea</i>) as well.
<p> The
trail, after crossing the ravine, turned south along the steep east-facing
slope through forest as mesic as any encountered on the climb. The canopy was dominated by Black Birch,
Beech and Hemlock and there was at least one Serviceberry a foot (30 cm) dbh
and of canopy height. Round-leaf Violet
also continued abundant and fungi of the genus <i>Russula</i> were common.
<p> Shortly
the trail turned 180 degrees and ascended the south facing slope of the steep
spur. Here we saw our first
blueberries, either Upland Low (<i>Vaccinium
pallidum</i>) or Late Low (<i>V. vacillans</i>),
but accompanied by Great Rhododendron and Hemlock under a canopy of White and
Northern Red Oaks, Beech and White Pine. 
However all Round-leaved Violets had vanished here. A little higher we encountered our first
Chestnut Oak in the area with a little Black Gum, but again accompanied by
Northern Red Oak, Black Oak, Beech, Hemlock, Striped Maple and Witch
Hazel. However a dryer, more abundant
acidic environment than below was indicated by Mountain Laurel, more Low
Blueberries and a little Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria
procumbens</i>). Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>) as well as a few
Sassafras seedlings were also present at the highest elevation attained. 
<p>&nbsp;
</ul>
<p><b>Summary</b>
<ul>

<p> It
is likely that the comparatively luxuriant vegetation of the Horseshoe Run
floodplain owes its origin at least in part to the influx of water and sediment
from the carbonate rocks of upstream Mauch Chunk Group and Greenbrier
Limestone. Since the area falls in the
region of the Appalachian cloudy day maximum, the observed weak effect of
aspect is to be expected. The fairly
pronounced effect of cold air drainage/accumulation on the Horseshoe Run flood
plain, as indicated by certain species there, follows readily from the
surrounding topography. Cold air
accumulated on the northwest slope of nearby Backbone Mountain, which rises to
3600 ft (1100 meters), can find access to Horseshoe Run along Laurel Run or
other concavities. In contrast the weak
or nonexistent effect of the lapse rate cooling on plant distribution along the
Losh Trail is to be expected given the limited elevation change along our
traverse. However the ecological role
of Black Birch is illustrated here in that it occupies high gradient ravine
bottoms and moist slopes where cold air accumulation is insufficient for Yellow
Birch to occur.
<p> While
the character of vegetation on Dorman Ridge is representative of the Allegheny
Mountains at low to moderate elevations, it is quite different from that of the
Valley and Ridge at similar elevations and on similar topography. This is shown by sparseness of certain oaks,
Black Gum, Sassafras and a number of ericaceae coupled with the abundance of
Beech, Hemlock and Great Rhododendron. 
It is likely that this difference is largely attributable to the
increase of air and soil moisture and cool temperatures that result form the
greater degree of cloud cover as compared to the Valley and Ridge.

<p><b>Return to Horseshoe Run / Dorman Ridge</b>
<br> 
<b>Source Walks: 9-21-98 and 9-23-98</b>
<ul>
<p><b> </b>We arrived at the Horseshoe Run
campground on the afternoon of 9-21-98 after noting that the Red Maple at
higher elevations on Canaan Mountain had already turned a brilliant crimson.
Our inventories here should be considered in conjunction with those done in
July, 1996.
<p> Our
first inventory, on the afternoon of 9-21-98 was more thorough for the flood
plain than that of 1996. It began about 1/6 mile ( 0. 27 km ) southwest of the
grove of large White Pine and Hemlock described on our 1996 visit and extended
to the vicinity of the Losh Trail crossing of the Run.
<p> Noted
at the start was an abundance of unidentified warblers and other small birds,
including Goldfinch (<i>Spinus tristis</i>) 
in both low shrubery and in the treetops. Sycamore appeared to be the dominant
canopy species, with many trees in excess of two feet ( 0.6 m ) dbh. Next in
frequency, but smaller in size, appeared to be Yellow and Black Birches taken
together, followed by Beech, Red and Sugar Maples, Tuliptree, Shagbark Hickory,
Hemlock, White Pine and a little American Basswood. Seedlings of Bitternut
Hickory were quite common. It is likely that a number of other species such as
White Ash, seen on our earlier visit, were also present, if not noted.
Muscletree was a common understory species,as was the hawthorn <i>Crataegus 
flbellata</i>. Dominant shrubs appeared to be Spice Bush and Great
Rhododendron, while a little Leatherwood (<i>Dirca
 palustris</i>
) was seen near the stream. Grape vines, at least in part Summer Grape were
common, as was Virginia Creeper. Also seen was Hispid Greenbrier (<i>Smilax 
hispida</i>) . As is true for trees, it is likely that other vines and
shrubs, such as Witch Hazel, which was noted on our 1996 visit , were present.
<p> Herbs
noted were New York, Silvery Athyrium and Christmas Ferns, Smooth Sweet Cicely,
Bottlebrush Grass, abundant Broad-leaf Waterleaf, Hog Peanut, Wingstem,
Virginia Knotweed, Wood Nettle, Clearweed, Crooked-stem Aster, White Wood
Aster, Broad-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago flexicaulis</i>) , White Snakeroot, Downy
Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum pubescens</i>) , White Vervain (<i>Verbena 
urticifolia</i>) , Great Blue Lobelia (<i>Lobelia siphilitica</i>) , <i>Carex 
plantaginea,</i> Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>) , Wirestem Muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia frondosa</i>) , Slender-flowered Muhly (<i>M. Tenuiflora</i>) and
Woodland Muhly (<i>M. sylvatica</i>) . Particularily noted were
the different modes of occurrence of the last two similar-appearing species,
with Slender-flowered Muhly occurring
as widely separated culms and Woodland Muhly in dense clumps.
<p> The
alien Ground Ivy (<i>Glechoma hederacea</i>) was common in a number of
places, particularily near the campground. Some observed fungi were <i>Bisporella 
citrina </i>and <i>Scutellinia 
scutellata</i> ( Eye-lash Cup ). A large down bole bore the mosses <i>Anomodon</i> <i>rostratus</i> and species of <i>Hypnum </i>and <i>Entodon</i>. Beech seen on the flood plain
appeared healthy and no evidence of the Scale / <i>Nectria </i>Complex was seen.
<p> The
diverse community of plants disclosed by our inventory of the flood plain
substantiates our previous conclusion regarding the likely influx of nutrients
from the varied rocks of the upstream watershed. The occurrence of Great
Rhododendron as virtually the only heath is cosistent with the relatively high
pH range of this species as revealed by its proximity to limestone in a number
of occurrences such as those in the Canaan Valley for example (see <a href=canaanv.htm>our Canaan
Valley section</a>). A measurement of the pH of the water of Horseshoe Run yielded
5.5, a value that might have reflected the recent rain.
<p> Our
inventory along the Losh Trail occurred on the almost clear, very cool morning
of 9-23-98. These cnditions followed the passage of a cold front and rain on
the previous day. As we crossed the bridge over Horseshoe Run we flushed a
Great Blue Heron (<i>Ardea herodias</i>) some distance down stream.
Crows (<i>Corvus brachyrhynchos</i>) and Blue Jays (<i>Cyanocitta cristata</i>) 
called as we started up the trail. A point of interest was the Yellow Birch on
the bank of Horseshoe Run here because it was the last we were to see on the
traverse.
<p> Beyond
the bridge the trail runs for a short distance along the ravine bottom which
marks the course of Losh Run. The reader may refer to our 7-13-96 description
of the ravine bottom flora. However we draw attention again to the abundance of
Ground Pine and particularly to the unusually long branches on this clubmoss
here. In what follows we describe in the sequence of their observation the
species and terrain features along the Losh Trail.
<p> As
we began our ascent above the ravine bottom we noted that Beech, albeit mostly
small in size, was common. Here also were American Chestnut Sprouts, quite
large White and Scarlet Oaks, with somewhat smaller Black Birch and Beech and
Hemlock saplings in the understory. Blue Jays again attracted our attention
with a great variety of calls, including imitations of other birds. Continuing
our climb, Great Rhododendron lay along a branch ravine slope. Observed here
were a number of fungi, including the edible and familiar Chicken of the Woods
(<i>Polyporus sulphureus</i>) on a dead oak,<i>Daedaliopsis confragosa</i> ,also
on wood, then <i>Collybia confluens 
</i>and <i>Marasmius rotula</i>,
both on dead leaf duff, and the medicinal <i>Piptoporus betulinus</i>. These were followed by
Broad-leaf Beech Fern (<i>Phegopteris hexagonoptera</i>) , Bootts Goldenrod (<i>Solidago 
boottii</i>) , numbers of small Beech under large oak and species of <i>Pogonatum 
</i>and <i>Leucobryum </i>mosses on soil with an unidentified
liverwort.
<p> Just
above, small Beech continued to be conspicuous under larger Northern Red and
White Oaks and a Pignut Hickory of unidentified species. Seen at the bases of
White Oak were mosses that included an unidentified <i>Anomodon</i> and <i>Campylium chrysophyllum </i>accompaied by a liverwort of the genus <i>Porella</i>. Here also, at the Trail edge, grew widely-separated culms
of Slender-flowered Muhly with Wreath Goldenrod (<i>Solidago caesia</i>) . Next
seen was the fungus <i>Cordiceps militaris</i>, parasitic on larvae and pupae
of lepidoptera, then Panicled Hawkweed (<i>Hieracium paniculatum</i>) in bloom. Again under
White Oak, there was Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex</i>) , Autumn Bent Grass (<i>Agrostis 
perennans</i>) and an unidentified species of the moss <i>Fissidens</i>, while off to the side, among
flag-sized talus, a little Teaberry. Here also we became aware that, although
we had been seeing abundant Red Maple, we had seen no Sugar Maple since we left
the flood plain.
<p> We
now came to a sturdy, healthy- looking White Oak whose lower trunk bark was
covered by a scattering of small ( one cm ) bracket-type fungus. This fungus appeared to be confined to the tops
of bark ridges and was accompanied by what appeared to be a cream-colored
crustose lichen. Not far beyond this curiosity we found ensconced in a bed of <i>Fissidens 
</i>and <i>Campylium </i>mosses, a tiny ( ~ 0.5 cm ) wonder of a
white slug with numerous black spots. The soil here was sandy, light in color
and with abundant organic surface matter- though not a true mor.
<p> Once
again we were impressed by the number of Hemlock saplings that now came into
view. Here were several fungi, including an unidentified <i>Mycena </i>and a <i>Strobilurus conigenioides</i>, with the
latter possibly occurring on the cones of Hemlock, although this association
does not appear in our notes. Also noted was a Red Maple sapling bearing <i>Broterella 
recurvans,</i> a moss with northern and montane distributions ( Crum and
Anderson, 1981 ).
<p> Scattered
among the other trees were hickories with shaggy bark, at least some of which
were identified as Shagbark on the basis of their nuts. Accompaning the
hickories were Beaked Hazelnut (<i>Corylus cornuta</i>) and an isolated Muscletree.
There were also small Beech and Hemlock under much larger Northern Red and
White Oaks and Tuliptree, as well as Black Birch of intermediate size. Here
too, as at other locations on this traverse, we saw evidense of heavy Deer
browsing on undergrowth such as Common Greenbrier and low trees and shrubs.
<p> Continuing
our climb, we noted Round-lobe Hepatica, possible Squaw Weed (<i>Senecio 
obovatus</i>) , Broad-leaf Goldenrod, Blue Wood Aster (<i>Aster 
cordifolius</i>) , Basil Balm (<i>Monarda clinopodia</i>) and small Beech and Red
Maple under larger Oak. Following these were the Pear-shaped Puffball (<i>Lycoperdon 
pyriforme</i>) , Canada Brome Grass (<i>Bromus purgans</i>) and the
panic grass <i>Panicum boscii</i>.
<p> At
this point there was a low, quite luxuriant vine of Summer Grape, but without
fruit, as well as a little Spice Bush, and under a large White Oak, the mosses <i>Anomodon rostratus</i> and species of <i>Fissidens</i> and <i>Mnium</i>.
These were followed by an <i>Entodon</i> moss and the fungi Dead Man's Fingers (<i>Xylaria 
polymorpha</i>) and <i>Lycoperdon perlatum</i> .It is likely that this general area is the same as that seen and
described as a transition to a more mesic forest on our 1996 traverse. 
<p> We
had now arrived at the crossing of Losh Run where we had seen <i>Carex</i> 
<i>scabrata</i> in 1996. As we approached the crossing we
again also noted Broad Beech Fern, and after the crossing, a single plant of
White Baneberry and the fungus <i>Amanita</i> <i>vaginata</i>.
<p> The stream crossing was followed by
a sharp left turn in the Trail that led to the east-facing steep mesic slope
also described from our 1996 traverse. Some fungi noted on this slope were <i>Stropharis 
throusta</i>, <i>Crepidotus applanatus</i> and <i>Clitocybe clavipes</i>.
<p> We soon reached the sharp right turn
in the Trail which led directly up the spur crest. As reported for our 1996
visit, the forest undergoes a transition here to a dryer, more ericaceous type.
Precisely at the turn in the Trail we noted a one foot ( 0.3 m ) diameter down
bole that was heavily-covered on its upper surface by one or more unidentified
species of Hypnum moss. As noted previously, the canopy on this spur included
Northern Red Oak, and on this day we were made explicitly aware of the bumper
crop of large acorns on these trees by their steady rain on our heads. As we
continued our ascent <i>Hypnum</i> was
further observed to be common on areas of flat ground, stones and larger down
wood, while at the base of a dead decapitated White Pine snag we identified the
moss <i>Rhodobryum roseum</i>. It should be mentioned that although the spur forest
is markedly more xeric and ericaceous than that we passed through below, small
Hemlock and Beech saplings are common here as well.
<p> Additional species were identified
by R. Hunsucker on a separate traverse along a terrace immediately above
Horseshoe Run. Included were Field Mint (<i>
Mentha arvensis</i>) and Tall White
Lettuce (<i>Prenanthes altissima</i>) and the following fungi:
<p>
<i> Inonotus radicans</i>
<br><i> Bjerkandera adusta</i>
<br><i> Ganoderma applanatum</i>
<br> <i>Hygrophorus marginatus</i> var <i>concolor</i>
<br> <i>Tylopilus felleus</i>
<br> <i>Pholiota </i> sp
<br> <i> Pluteus 
cervinus </i>
<br><i> Lactarius 
chrysorrheus</i>
<br> <i>L. volemus</i>
<br><i> L. 
piperatus</i>
<br> <i>L</i>. sp
<br> <i>Russula</i> sp
<br> <i>Amanita flavoconia</i>
<br><i> Tricholomopsis platyphylla</i>
<br><i> Clitocybe clavipes</i>
<br><i> C. maculata</i>
<br><i> Polyporus squamosus</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;</i>
<br> A comparison of this list with the
fungi observed along the Losh Trail finds only one species in common, namely <i>Clitocybe 
clavipes</i>. However the significance of this is unclear given the
small number of species involved.
<p> The salient characteristics of the
slope forest along the Losh Trail are 1) The prevalence of Black Birch to the
complete exclusion of Yellow Birch and 2) the pervasive occurrence of small
trees and saplings of Beech and Hemlock under large canopy species such as oak,
Tuliptree and to a lesser degree, Black Birch. An adequate explanation for the
occurence of the birches was provided earlier. However, it required this second
visit to make us aware of the mode of occurrence of Beech and Hemlock. It is
tempting to interpret the presence of these trees in the understory as part of
the on-going replacement of less tolerant and more fire resistant species of
the early succession in the logged forest. This trend toward a more mesic
forest in recent years may be in part a result of fire suppression, an idea
espoused by Abrams and Downs ( 1990 ) and others.
