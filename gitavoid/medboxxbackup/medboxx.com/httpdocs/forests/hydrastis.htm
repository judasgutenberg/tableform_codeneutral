<p><h1>Hydrastis canadensis L. - Two Appalachian
Occurrences</h1>
<b>May, 2001 updated Dec., 2004</b>

<blockquote>




<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<p>We here explore the occurrence of
<i>Hydrastis canadensis</i> (Goldenseal) on two very different geologic substrates in the Appalachian
Mountains. This herb, sought ever more intensively for its medicinal and herbal
properties, is under grave threat of extirpation wherever it occurs. For this
reason the location of one of these occurrences, first discovered in our
Project inventories, and by far the largest, is not revealed.
<p> Central to
our study are the broad settings of the occurrences of the species in terms
of geology, topography, soil and
microclimate. Special attention is given to proximity to various rock types,
other plants and to soil character, particularly with respect to pH. Also
included is the variation in type of the enveloping forest. This section is
also unashamedly opportunistic in its exposition on peripheral but interesting
details of the occurrence of other species.
<p> The first
occurrence discussed is in calcareous terrain, specifically on dolomitic
limestone with substantial inclusions of the siliceous rock chert. This
formation, the Ordovician Beekmantown, exhibits a low grade of metamorphism
dating to the Appalachian orogeny. Of the second occurrence we need only say
that it has developed on soils derived from rock of granitic composition in a
more mountainous terrain than the first occurrence. There is a difference
between our treatment here of the two occurrences. While inventories of the
calcareous area extended over years, those of the granitic area occurred during
several days, were of greater intensity and were executed on specific
traverses.
<p> As in other
sections of this work, both the
scientific and common names of species are given on first mention – assuming a
species has a well-known common name – but only the common name thereafter.
Exceptions are made for certain genra represented by only one American species
with a simple scientific name. Thus the genus name &quot;<i>Hydrastis</i>&quot;
rather than &quot;Goldenseal&quot; is frequently used here, as is &quot;<i>Medeola</i>&quot;
rather than &quot;Indian Cucumberroot&quot;.

<h2>Calcareous Substrate</h2>
<ul>

<p> This
occurrence of<i>Hydrastis </i>is on soils derived from dolomitic limestone
which also has conspicuous chert components (Rader, 1967) . Both limestone and
chert are highly fractured, in part as a consequence of proximity to the
Pulasky – Staunton Fault, a major structural feature of the Great Valley of Virginia.
Elevation of the occurrence is a little above 1600 feet (488 m) asl.
<p> <i>Hydrastis
</i>occurs in several small patches on the southeast facing slope of a small
ridge approximately ¼ mile (0.4 km) in length and which rises 120 feet (37 m) above the flood plain of Folly Mills Creek. This stream, a branch of the
South Fork of the Shenandoah River, is near the middle of the Shenandoah
Valley. An embayment of the flood Plain indents the ridge and is the site of a
large artesian spring that feeds a calcareous wetland which is the site of a
number of rare disjunct plants (Hunsucker and Mueller, 1998) .Both ridge and
wetland fall in a State natural area preserve. Several distinct forest types as
well as pasture land reverting to forest occupy the ridge. Forming the ridge's
backbone, as exposed on its crest, are massive beds of fractured chert.which
also extends down both northwest and southeast slopes as talus and scattered
outcrops. This chert dominates the northwest slope, which has only minor
outcrops of limestone. In contrast, the southeast slope is dominated by
calcareous colluvium with numerous limestone outcrops. However, there are minor
outcrops and substantial chert talus on this slope as well. Reverting
pastureland on the ridge's southwest end bears few rock outcrops and appears to
consist largely of calcareous but leached residual soils. This disposition of
rock types has resulted in an ericaceous oak forest on the ridge crest and the
northwest slope and a dry mesic calcareous forest on the southeast slope. Where
more abundant limestone outcrops occur on the latter, there is a Chinquapin Oak
(<i>Quercus muehlenbergii</i>) –
White Ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>) 
variant of the calcareous forest. The acid environment of most of the chert
areas is enhanced by vertical leaching. However, this leaching also occurs in
calcareous areas, and is even effective on outcrops of massive limestone. Where
colluvial processes dominate, as on steep southeast slopes, deeper soils
establish contact with and incorporate calcareous material, which is then
brought into the shallow feeder root zone by down slope earth movement.
Enhancing this effect is the lateral movement and bathing of the root zone by subsurface solutions that also
originate in the calcareous depths. The result is a down slope enrichment of
soils on these colluvial slopes. Soils here are of the mull type, brown and
rich in clay and with organic matter that is well incorporated into the mineral
matter to depths of a meter or more. Where 
organic matter is most abundant, they are a darker shade of brown.
<p> The closed
canopy forest of the ridge is a mature remnant of recent logging (~ 30 years
before the present) which took an older but probably still secondary
component. Consequently there is an un-equilibrated age distribution of trees, although the mix of trees and the
floras in general clearly reflect substrate and aspect with fidelity. Few trees
however exceed a foot (0.3 m) dbh or 70 years in age.
<p> The canopy
of the ericaceous oak forest of the ridge top and northwest slope is dominated
by White and Black Oaks (<i>Quercus 
alba</i> and <i>Q. velutina</i>), with less common Pignut Hickory (<i>Carya 
glabra</i>), Red Hickory (<i>C. 
ovalis</i>), Mockernut Hickory (<i>C. 
tomentosa</i>), Red Maple (<i>Acer 
rubrum</i>) and Black Cherry (<i>Prunus serotina</i>) . Minor canopy species are White Pine (<i>Pinus strobus</i>), Virginia Pine (<i>Pinus virginiana</i>), Pitch Pine (<i>Pinus rigida</i>), Scarlet Oak (<i>Quercus coccinea</i> ), Chestnut Oak (<i>Q. 
prinus</i>) (one), Sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>), Tuliptree (<i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i>) (one), Canada Hemlock (
<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>) , Black Gum (<i>Nyssa sylvatica</i>) (one) and one American
Chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>)
sapling. Small and understory trees are Downy Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier arborea</i>) and Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus florida</i>) . Shrubs in the most acidic,
rocky areas include Upland Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>), Deer Berry (<i>V. stamineum</i>), Pinxter Azalea (<i>Rhododendron
 nudiflorum</i> ), Black Huckleberry (<i>Gaylussacia baccata</i>), Corymbed Spiraea (<i>Spiraea</i> <i>corymbosa</i>) and St Andrew's Cross (<i>Hypericum hypericoides</i>) . Some Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>) may also have been present
at one time but was likely browsed away by goats. Shrubs that occur throughout
are Black Haw Viburnum (<i>Viburnum 
prunifolium</i>), Maple- leaf Viburnum (<i>V.</i> <i>acerifolium</i>) and Carolina Rose (<i>Rosa Carolina</i>) . Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus
 quinquefolia</i>), Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus radicans</i>), Summer Grape (<i>Vitis aestivalis</i>) and Northern Dewberry (<i>Rubus 
flagellaris</i>) are common vines except in the most acidic areas. A
heavy leaf mat is everywhere present in this forest, and soils tend to be of
the mor type <sup><a href=#1>(1)</a></sup>. Here, as in most areas of the mountains, many Flowering
Dogwood trees have been killed by Anthracnose (<i>Discula destructiva</i>).
<p> The status
of Coral Berry (<i>Symphoricarpos 
orbiculatus</i>), a somewhat calciphile shrub, in the acidic forest is
unclear. While it apparently is excluded from the interior of the most acidic
stands here, it occurs on their
periphery in soils with pH less than 5.0.
<p>However it appears to be excluded generally in the mountains
where acid soils are of wide extent. It is possible that this plant satisfies
its stability requirements through extended root contact with distant
calcareous elements in soils. Perry (1982) documented and illustrated the
enormous reach of tree roots and it has been postulated (Mueller, 2000) that
roots of a given plant might well seek out soil volumes compatible with its
nutrient requirements.
<p>Herbs most characteristic of the
most rocky and acidic areas are Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila maculata</i>), Pipsisewa (<i>C. umbellata</i>), Rattlesnake Weed (<i>Hieracium venosum</i>), Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>), Roundlobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica americana</i>), and Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla canadensis </i>and<i>P. simplex</i>) . Other species of wider
distribution are Plantain-leaf Pussytoes (<i>Antennaria</i> <i>plantaginifolia</i>), the alien
Mouse-ear Chickweed (<i>Cerastrum 
viscosum</i>), Alumroot (<i>Heuchera 
americana</i>), American Pennyroyal (<i>Hedeoma pulegioides</i>), Common Speedwell (<i>Veronica officinalis</i>), Hairy Bedstraw (<i>
Galium pilosum</i>), Great Chickweed (<i>
Stellaria pubera</i>), Hairy Hawkweed
(<i>Hieracium gronovii</i>), White
Wood Aster (<i>Aster divaricatus</i>), 
Wavy-leaf Aster (<i>A. undulatus</i>), 
Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii
</i>), Cut-leaf Goldenrod (<i>S. arguta</i>), Silverrod (S. bicolor), Venus Looking Glass (<i>Specularia perfoliata</i>), the tick trefoil <i>Desmodium nudiflorum</i>, Four-leaf Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>), Rue Anemone (<i>Anemonella thalictroides</i>), Hairy-jointed Meadow
Parsnip (<i>Thaspium barbinode</i>), 
Yellow Star Grass (<i>Hypoxis hirsuta</i>), 
Spiked Lobelia (<i>Lobelia spicata </i> var 
scaposa), Cutleaf Grapefern (<i>Botrychium</i> <i>dissectum</i>), Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>), Slender Gerardia (<i>Gerardia tenuifolia</i>), the sedges <i>Carex pensylvanica</i>, <i>C. wildenowii, C. digitalis, C.</i> <i>rosea </i> and the grasses Poverty Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia spicata</i>), Autumn Bent Grass (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>), Nimblewill (<i>Muhlenbergia schreberi</i>), Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>) and the alien Canada Bluegrass
(<i>Poa compressa</i>) .Additionally
Early Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga 
virginiensis</i>), Common Many Knees (<i>Polgonatum biflorum</i>) and unidentified violets (<i>Viola</i> sp) are usually confined to tree bases. It
is also interesting that neither Pipsisewa, a northern species, nor Roudlobe
Hepatica ever occur on any south or southeast 
slope, but are confined to the northwest slope, although Spotted
Wintergreen is common on acidic areas everywhere. Also, unlike Spotted
Wintergreen, Pipsisewa has never been observed to flower here.
<p> As might be expected, wherever 
limestone outcrops occur in the dominantly ericaceous oak forest, the
area in proximity to them bears a richer, more mesic flora characteristic of
calcareous, more alkaline soils. In one place, in the midst of an acidic area
with numerous Red Maple seedlings, a small limestone outcrop is surrounded by a meter wide zone from which all Red
Maple is excluded in a visual display of the stability relations of this
species (see Fig. 1, Mueller, 2000) .
<p>Although the relatively dry
character of this forest does not favor mosses, certain species are
concentrated at tree bases on rocks and small elevations. Most conspicuous is a
haircap moss, likely <i>Polytrichum 
ohioense</i> from its macroscopic features. Other common species on soil
are Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium 
delicatulum</i>) and false haircap, likely <i>Atrichum angustatum</i> in part, while <i>Hedwigia ciliata</i> is, as is usual, found on
siliceous rock, in this case chert. One or more species of <i>Mnium</i> also
occur.
<p>In the most acidic parts of the
ericaceous oak forest pH values range from about 4.4 to 5.5, and these values
are regularly obtained in close proximity to Hepatica, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, Spotted Wintergreen, Pipsisewa,
Rattlesnake Weed, the Blueberries, Black Huckleberry and Azalea. Among the
lowest are those obtained from soil immediately beneath<i>Polytrichum</i>
mats.
<p>A large open area (pasture) on the
ridge crest also has prevailingly acid soils. Common herbs there are
Long-leaved Bluets (<i>Houstonia 
longifolia</i>), Pinweed (<i>Lechea tenuifolia</i>), Creeping Bush Clover (<i>Lespedeza repens</i>), Whorled Milkwort (<i>Polygala</i> <i>verticillata</i>), Bird-foot Violet (<i>
Viola pedata</i>), Ovate-leaved Violet
(<i>V. fimbriatula</i>), Blue Curls (<i>
Trichostema dichotomum</i>), Six-week
Fescue (<i>Festuca octoflora</i>), 
Tarweed (<i>Cuphea petiolata</i>), Indian Tobacco (<i>Lobelia inflata</i>) and Poverty Oat Grass. Where
small elevations with a substantial chert component in the soil occur, there is
a dense intergrowth of mosses and lichens as well as some of the
aforementioned herbs. By far the most
common moss here is <i>Dicranum 
scoparium</i> and the most conspicuous lichen a fruticose <i>Cladina</i>,
likely<i>Cladina subtenuis</i>. Values
of pH in these patches tend to be low, and in soil immediately beneath <i>Dicranum</i>
is near 4.5.
<p> At
the southwestern edge of the ridge crest forest there is a stand of Virginia
Pine that is encroaching on pasture. Although the interior of this stand has
virtually no ground flora, the better lit edge has a cover of Poverty Oat Grass
and a somewhat uncommon fruticose lichen <i>Cetraria arenaria</i>. 
<p>On the ridge, as in many areas
inventoried by us, there appears to be a correlation between soil pH and the
abundance and diversity of fungi, with acid soils being favored. Consequently
mushrooms appear to be most abundant and in greater variety in the ericaceous
oak forest as compared to the forest on the calcareous slope.
<p>Although the canopy species of the
ericaceous oak forest are also to be found on the southeast slope, additional
species occur on the latter, particularly on calcareous colluvium. Especially
abundant on the colluvium are White Ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>), Bitternut Hickory (<i>Carya cordiformis</i>), Black Walnut (<i>Juglans nigra</i>), Hackberry (<i>Celtis occidentalis</i>) of stunted form, Slippery
Elm (<i>Ulmus rubra</i>), Northern
Red Oak (<i>Quercus rubrum</i>) and
Chinquapin Oak (<i>Q. muehlenbergii</i>). Of these Chinquapin Oak is closely associated with limestone outcrops and
where these are particularly abundant, this oak and White Ash dominate the
canopy. Other scattered canopy species are Red Mulberry (<i>Morus rubra</i>), Post Oak (<i>Quercus stellata</i>), Persimmon (<i>
Diospyros virginiana</i>), Black
Locust (<i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>), 
Sycamore (<i>Platanus occidentalis</i>) (one), Sugar Maple (<i>Acer 
saccharum</i>) (one) and Tuliptree (one) . Red Maple and Scarlet Oak
occur in a few locations of high acidity such as chert outcrops and talus slopes.
Virginia Juniper (<i>Juniperus 
virginiana</i>) is scattered throughout; there are a few White Pine and
the alien Tree- of –Heaven (<i>Ailanthus 
altissima</i>) occurs in a few openings. As in the ericaceous oak
forest, Flowering Dogwood is a common understory tree, but Downy Serviceberry
is much less common, and Redbud (<i>Cercis 
canadensis</i>) is an additional species here. Also, as previously
indicated, Hackberry is of stunted form
and really forms the most abundant understory in places. Other small trees and shrubs, mostly at the
edges of this forest, are Black Haw Viburnum, Wild Plum (<i>Prunus americana</i>), American Hazelnut (<i>Corylus americana</i>), Coral Berry, Black
Raspberry (<i>Rubus occidentalis</i>), Allegheny Blackberry (<i>R. 
allegheniensis</i>) and Lance-leaved Buckthorn (<i>Rhmnus lanceolata</i>) (one).
<p> Japanese
Honeysucle (<i>Lonicera japonica</i>) 
is the most common vine. Among natives Hispid Greenbrier (<i>Smilax hispida</i>), Virginia Creeper, Poison Ivy and Winter Grape (<i>Vitis vulpina</i>) dominate, but Summer Grape, Canada
Moonseed (<i>Menispermum canadense</i>), Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax 
rotundifolia</i>), Bittersweet (<i>Celastrus scandens</i>) and Northern Dewberry also occur..
<p>Common herbs on the calcareous
slopes are Lopseed (<i>Phryma 
leptostachya</i>), Honewort (<i>Cryptotaenia canadensis</i>), Starry Campion (<i>Silene stellata</i>), Plume Lily (<i>
Smilacina racemosa</i>), Nodding
Fescue, Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium 
virginianum</i>), the tick-trefoils <i>Desmodium glutinosum</i> and <i>D. paniculatum</i>, Bloodroot (<i>Sanguinaria canadensis</i>), Hispid Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus hispidus</i>), Allegheny Crowfoot (<i>R. allegheniensis</i>), Kidney-leaf Crowfoot (
<i>R. Abortivus</i>), Hooked Crowfoot
(<i>R. recurvatus</i>), the alien
Bulbous Buttercup (<i>R</i>. <i>bulbosa
</i>), Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata
</i>), Thimbleweed (<i>Anemone 
virginiana</i>), Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia perfoliata</i>), Three-lobed Violet (<i>Viola triloba</i>), Tall Agrimony (<i>
Agrimonia gryposepala</i>), Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>), Smooth Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza longistylis</i>), Wild Geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>), Wild Comfrey (<i>Cynoglossum virginianum</i>), Pale Indian Plantain (<i>Cacalia atriplicifolia</i>), Pilewort (<i>Erechtites hieracifolia</i>), Wild Liquorice (<i>Galium circaezans</i>), Cleavers (<i>Galium aperine</i>), Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>), Virginia Knotweed (<i>Polygonum virginianum</i>), Clearweed (<i>Pilea pumila</i>), Hairy Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria elliptica</i>), Wingstem (<i>Verbesina alternifolia</i>), May Apple (<i>Podophyllum</i> <i>peltatum</i>), Enchanter's Nightshade (<i>Circaea quadrisulcata</i>), Poverty Oat Grass, <i>Carex
 rosea, C. sparganioides, C. laxiflora</i>, Ebony Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium platyneuron</i>), Dotted St Johns Wort (<i>
Hypericum dentatum</i>), Upright
Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis stricta</i>), Adder's Tongue (<i>Ophioglossum 
vulgatum</i>), Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum</i> <i>acrostichoides</i>), Common Many Knees,
Stickweed (<i>Hackelia virginiana</i>), 
Cranefly Orchid (<i>Tipularia discolor</i>) and the panic grass <i>Panicum boscii</i>.
Under moist conditions Spotted Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens capensis</i>) seeds on the lower slope just
above the wetland where it always occurs. Additionally, Wild Pink (<i>Silene pensylvanica</i>) is widely distributed in
sunny exposures – also on limestone outcrops - 
on the southeast slope as well as in ericaceous oak forest of the ridge
crest, but appears to be absent on the northwest slope. Also Yellow Stargrass
and the tick-trefoil <i>Desmodium 
rotundifolium</i>, species usually found in acidic terrain, were found
in the Chinquapin Oak – White Ash forest. Soil in close proximity to the former
had pH=5.8., hinting that acid leaching may enable these species to grow here
at the margins of their stability fields. A single clump of Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium filix-femina</i>) was observed in a chert
talus area of the southeast slope.
<p>The northeast end of the ridge is
occupied by a dry mesic stand with a canopy little larger than sapling size, a
consequence of recent reversion from pasture. Aspect here is almost due south
and the slope gentle. Dominance is by the four species of hickories previously
listed, with less common Black and White Oaks, Black Walnut, Slippery Elm and
minor Chinquapin Oak and Red Mulberry. Black Haw Viburnum is common and a
single small Spice Bush (<i>Lindera 
benzoin</i>) was seen. Many of the mesic herbs already listed for the
calcareous slopes occur here, but some additions include the somewhat
calciphile sedges <i>Carex granularis,</i>
and <i>C. frankii</i>, Cutleaf
Toothwort (<i>Dentaria laciniata</i>), Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia
</i>), Tinker's Weed (<i>Triosteum 
perfoliatum</i>), Squaw Weed (<i>Senecio obovatus</i>), Virginia Avens (<i>Geum virginianum</i>), Four-leaved Milkweed (<i>Asclepias quadrifolia</i>), Riparian Wild Rye (<i>Elymus riparius</i>), White Grass (<i>
Leersia virginica</i>) and the Blue-eyed
Grass <i>Sisyrinchium angustifolium</i>.
The two sedges, which are common in the nearby wetland, may be metastable (
Mueller, 2000) here, since they could have been established in an unusually
wet year. Where this stand borders ericaceous oak forest and at certain leached
spots in the interior of the stand, one may also find Spotted Wintergreen,
Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa uniflora</i>) and Pinesap (<i>M. hypopithys</i>) .
Also locally, within the stand, are small, usually elevated areas, of
apparently more intense leaching, and in these areas one may find small patches
of <i>Polytrichum</i> moss.
<p>Down slope from this stand, where a
pasture opening with scattered Black Walnut is still reverting to forest, the
following were noted: Oldfield Goldenrod (<i>Solidago nemoralis</i>), Canada Goldenrod (<i>
S. canadensis</i>), Wild Bergamot (<i>
Monarda fistulosa</i>), abundant New
York Ironweed, Spanish Needles (<i>Bidens 
bipinnata</i>), Cudweed (<i>Gnaphalium obtusifolium</i>), Columbine (<i>Aquilegia canadensis</i>) and Purple Cliffbrake (<i>Pellaea ochropurpurea</i>) on limestone outcrops,
Purpletop (<i>Triodia flava</i>), 
Kentucky Bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>), Hairy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum 
lanuginosum</i>), Few-flowered Panic Grass (<i>Panicum oligosanthes</i>), Canada Bluegrass, Smooth
Ground Cherry (<i>Physalis subglaberata</i>) and Daisy Fleabane (<i>Erigeron 
annuus</i>).
<p>We now discuss the communities
which are located in closest proximity to or include<i>Hydrastis</i> as a
component. This herb is characterized by a fleshy rhizome and dense, almost
monocultural colonies. However, it is not clear that this mode of growth is a
result of propagation by rhizomes. The following species were recorded within
ten meters of the largest patch of<i>Hydrastis </i>on the calcareous
slope:Black Walnut, Slippery Elm, Hackberry, White Ash, Bitternut Hickory,
Mockernut Hickory, Red Hickory, Black Oak, White Oak, Black Cherry, Virginia

Bluegrass, Hedge Buckwheat (<i>Polgonum 
cristatum</i>), Brome Grass (<i>Bromus </i> sp), and Blunt-lobed Woodsia (<i>Woodsia obtusa</i>) .
<p> Associated
with the smaller patch of <i>Hydrastis</i> along the contour were the
following:Northern Red Oak, White Basswood, Slippery Elm, Bitternut Hickory,
Hackberry, Black Cherry, White Ash, Red Mulberry seedling, Red Maple seedling,
Virginia Juniper seedling, Flowering Dogwood, Black Haw Viburnum, Coral Berry,
Winter Grape, Japanese Honeysuckle,
Hispid Greenbrier, Virginia Creeper, Wild Rye (<i>Elymus</i> sp), Black Cohosh, Wild Geranium,

Canada Bluegrass, Enchanter's Nightshade, Black Snakeroot (<i>Sanicula canadensis</i>), Common Many Knees, Ebony
Spleenwort, Smooth Sweet Cicely, Wild Liquorice, Mealy Bellwort and Tall
Agrimony.
<p> The
southeast slope is prevailingly calcareous and many pH values, particularly in
the colluvial soils of the steeper slopes, fall in the range of 6.5 to 8.0.
However there are many places, even in close proximity to limestone outcrops,
where the soils are relatively acidic, likely as a result of vertical acid
leaching. Here pH may fall below 5.0.
In one – perhaps not unusual – case, a 6 inch (15 cm) – deep depression on a
massive limestone outcrop bore one plant each 
of the acidiphiles Spotted Wintergreen and Red Maple, with the latter
being a tiny, thick-stemmed and possibly old &quot;seedling&quot;. Soil within
the depression was rich in organic matter and, although in close contact with
both limestone and plant roots, had a pH of 5.0. Clearly, what is significant
here is the position of these acidiphiles on top of massive, slow- to-dissolve
limestone.
<p> During
September pH was determined for soil at a 2-3 inch (5-8 cm) depth within and
in the vicinity of the <i>Hydrastis</i> patches. A value of 5.8 was obtained
from within the largest patch. The same value was also determined in close
proximity to Blunt-lobed Woodsia a little upslope from this patch. However,
soil at the base of a Chinquapin Oak, also a little upslope, yielded an initial
value of pH= 6.2 and 24 hours later one of 7.0. Soil from within the second and
smaller patch had pH= 6.2 and again, after 24 hours this increased to 7.0.
<p> Values of
soil pH, again from depths of 2-3 inches in close proximity to plants of Ginseng (<i>Panax quinquefolius</i>) in the vicinity of the <i>Hydrastis</i>
patches, were also determined. A soil sample from the calcareous slope had an
initial value of 7.2, but 24 hours later this decreased to 6.3. A sample
obtained from chert talus and part of a mesic herb flora, yielded a pH of 6.6,
but 18 hours later one of 8.0. It seems likely that although the first sample
was from a calcareous soil it contained enough siliceous material to lower the
pH. Similarly, the second sample,
although from an apparently siliceous talus, may have incorporated some fine
calcareous material that reacted in this way. Of related interest was the
presence, also within the chert talus, and less than a meter from the second sample, of Spotted Wintergreen.
<p> The
southwest end of the ridge consists of a mostly gently southeast sloping
pasture that is reverting to forest. The primary woody pioneer species here is
Black Cherry, but Virginia Pine, Pitch Pine, a single Table Mountain Pine (<i>Pinus pungens</i>), Black Walnut, hawthorn,
including Cockspur Thorn (<i>Crataegus 
crus-galli</i>), Black Haw Viburnum, Coral Berry and the aliens Autumn
Olive (<i>Elaeagnus umbellata</i>), 
Morrow's Honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera 
morrowi</i>), abundant Japanese Honeysuckle and Multiflora Rose (
Rosa multiflora ) also occur. Among other species observed
were Virgin's Bower (<i>Clematis 
virginiana</i>), Black Raspberry, Allegheny Blackberry, Bittersweet,
Broomsedge (<i>Andropogon virginicus</i>), Kentucky Bluegrass, abundant Bulbous Buttercup, Bracted Plantain (<i>Plantago aristata</i>), Wild Bergamot, Clearweed
under Black Cherry, White Vervain (<i>Verbena 
urticifolia</i>), Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus virginicus</i>), Great Blue Lobelia (<i>Lobelia siphilitica</i>) and Poke (<i>Phytolacca americana</i>) . A number of these are
characteristic of rich, moist soils, while others are typical of dry calcareous
soils.
<p> The acidity
of soils in this reverting pasture ranges widely, and since slopes are gentle
for the most part, these soils are largely residual and thus have been subject
to considerable acid leaching. Measured pH values range from less than 5.0
under pine to greater than 7.0 under such species as Cockspur Thorn.
<p> While their
faunas are integral parts of the several forest types represented here, it has
not been possible to make detailed correlations between them. Also, in the
absence of systematic observations it is not possible to prioritize the
relative contributions of the various animal species to the ecosystem. Most
conspicuous and apparently most closely associated with the canopy are the tree
squirrels. Of these the Eastern Gray (<i>Sciurus carolinensis</i>) appears to be the most
abundant. However the Eastern Fox Squirrel (<i>S</i>. <i>niger</i>) is also common, as is the
Eastern Chipmunk (<i>Tamias striatus</i>). The Red Squirrel (<i>Tamiasciurus 
hudsonicus </i>) has been
observed on a northern aspect of the neighboring ridge, but not here. Although not seen on this ridge, the
Southern Flying Squirrel (<i>Glaucomys 
volans</i>) is likely to be present, as it is common in adjacent areas. It is significant that the frequency of squirrel nests on the ridge appears
to be the greatest of any area viewed by this reporter and is likely more than
one per acre. In a winter traverse of the ridge 25 nests were counted. The nest
density appears to be highest in the calcareous southeast facing slopes,
perhaps reflecting the richer soils as well as sun exposure there.
<p> The
Woodchuck (<i>Marmota monax</i>) is
also common, as indicated by sightings and burrow frequency. Perhaps the
dominant native herbivores are the Eastern Cottontail Rabbit (<i>Sylvilagus floridanus</i>) and the White-tailed Deer (
<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>), with
the latter in superabundance due to the lack of sufficient large predators. It
is of particular interest to our inventory that while many plants are affected
by deer browsing and grazing,<i>Hydrastis</i> may benefit from them. This is a
result of the apparent shunning of this plant by all herbivores, including
insects and domestic goats and horses as well!
<p> Of the
smaller mammalian herbivores mice are likely to be important, and of these, the
White-footed (<i>Peromyscus leucopus</i>) and Deer (<i>P. maniculatus</i>) Mice are most frequently
observed in the forest. Additionally, forest soils are everywhere kept well
aerated by the Eastern Mole (<i>Scalopus 
aquaticus</i>). It is further recognized that below these in size there
exists a vast community of arthropods and other invertebrates, vegetation and
detritus consumers, that may outclass all vertebrates. Of these, most
conspicuous, if not of greatest import in recent times, was the alien Gypsy
Moth (<i>Lymantria dispar</i>), which
five years before the present, had defoliated the ridge several years in
succession, then vanished abruptly from natural causes. However the vigor of
the ridge forest was such as to enable it to recover from the defoliation with
minimal observed effect. A more constant, although not as severe a defoliator,
especially of Black Cherry, is the Eastern Tent Caterpillar (<i>Malacosoma americanum</i>), which may be responsible
for the stunted and crooked form of this tree in the Valley and Ridge
physiographic province.
<p> The small
mammal herbivores are evidently well able to sustain their populations in the
face of numerous small predators. Among mammals the most frequently observed
are Raccoon (<i>Procyon lotor</i>), 
Gray Fox (<i>Urocyon cinereoargenteus</i>), Red Fox (<i>Vulpes fulva</i>), 
Opossum (<i>Didelphis marsupialis</i>), Striped Skunk (<i>Mephitis mephitis</i>), Longtail Weasel (<i>Mustela frenata</i>), various shrews and, by incursions from the nearby lowlands, Mink (<i>Mustela vison</i>) . These are joined by Great
Horned Owl (<i>Bubo</i> <i>virginianus</i>), Screech Owl (<i>Otus osio</i>), 
Red Shouldered Hawk (<i>Buteo lineatus</i>) and Red-tailed Hawk (<i>B. 
jamaicensis</i>), as well as a number of less common raptors. Also
contributing are such snakes as the Racer or &quot;Black Snake&quot; (<i>
Coluber constrictor</i>), which is the
most commonly observed snake. Even more frequently observed is the largely
vegetarian Eastern Box Turtle (<i>Terrapene 
carolina</i>), which reaches high densities in the area.
<p> Because of
the small size of the ridge forest, bird species – exclusive of the wide
ranging raptors – are those adapted to edge habitats and well able to cope with
predators. Among these are Yellow-billed Cuckoo (<i>Coccyzus americanus</i>), Rufous-sided Towhee (<i>
Pipilo erythrophthalmus</i>), Tufted
Titmouse (<i>Parus bicolor</i>), White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>Sitta 
caroliniensis</i>), Great Crested Flycatcher (<i>Myiarchus crinitus </i>), Carolina Wren (<i>Thryothorus ludovicianus</i>), Brown Thrasher (<i>Toxostema rufum</i>), Blue Jay (<i>Cyanocitta cristata</i>), Cardinal (<i>Cardinalis cardinalis</i>), American Robin (<i>Turdus migratoris</i>), American Crow (<i>Corvus brachyrhnchos</i>), and Mourning Dove (<i>Zenoida macroura</i>) . For the size of the bird and
tree sizes on the ridge, the Pileated Woodpecker (<i>Dryocopus pileatus</i>) is extraordinarily common
and has nested there, perhaps again reflecting the richness of habitat. However, the Red-bellied (<i>Melanerpes carolinus</i>) and the Downy (<i>Picoides pubescens</i>) are the most common
woodpeckers.
<p> The most
frequently heard forest interior bird is the Red -eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo</i> 
<i>olivaceus</i>), while others, such as Scarlet Tanager (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>), Wood Thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustlina</i>) and Ruffed Grouse (<i>Bonasa umbellus</i>) are only rarely heard or seen
due to the limited area, and probably do not nest on the ridge. An important
indicator species, the Whip-poor-will (<i>Caprimulgus vociferous</i>) was frequently heard
several decades ago, but has not been seen or heard since. There remain
however, two large birds that are frequently seen on the ridge. They are the
Wild Turkey (<i>Meleagris gallopavo</i>) 
and the Turkey Vulture (<i>Cathartes 
aura</i>) . It is unlikely that either of these nest on the ridge. Of
the two, Wild Turkey is apt to be most attracted by the many feeding
opportunities provided by the ridge's productive nut trees, while large groups
of the Vultures at times perch overnight.
<p> Just as the
species that are present on the ridge reflect the general environment and
microhabitats there, so also those which are absent but occur on neighboring
ridges contribute to our knowledge as
well. Thus the steep northern aspect of a 300 foot (92 m) high ridge across
the valley supports a rich mesic flora that includes the following: Beech ( <i>Fagus 
grandifolia</i>), basswoods (<i>
Tilia heterophylla</i> and <i>T. americana</i>), Butternut (<i>Juglans cinerea</i>), Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya 
virginiana</i>), Muscletree (<i>Carpinus caroliniana</i>), Spice Bush in
abundance, Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea 
canadensis</i>), Horse Balm (<i>Collinsonia canadensis</i>), Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>), Pale Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens pallida</i>), Wreath Goldenrod ( <i>Solidago caesia</i>), Virginia Spring Beauty (<i>Claytonia virginiana</i>), Smooth Yellow Violet (<i>Viola pensylvanica</i>), Large Yellow Ladyslipper
<i> (Cypripedium pubescens</i>), Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris
intermedia</i>) and Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>) . Of these, only White
Basswood and Spice Bush were observed on the <i>Hydrastus</i>-bearing ridge,
and then only as a single plant each. Since the neighboring ridge is also
underlain by limestone – in this case by Cambrian Elbrook Formation – we must
look to such factors as moisture and temperature influences to explain the
presence of these species on one ridge and not the other. It seems likely that
the northern aspect and the expected higher moisture content and lower
temperatures of the soil are involved, since most of the listed species for the
neighboring ridge demand such soils. It must not be assumed, however, that
because <i>Hydrastis</i> does not occur on the neighboring ridge, that the
environment there excludes it. We shall see that the other occurrence reported
on for this plant here is in a quite cool, moist environment as indicated by
coexisting species and general conditions.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul>
<h2>Granitic Substrate</h2>
<ul>
<p> Our second
occurrence of <i>Hydrastis,</i> here on a substrate derived in large part from
granitic rocks, lies in a small stream valley. This valley opens to a little
east of south, resulting in generally south southeast aspects. Slopes are
gentle on a terrace of granitic boulder and cobble alluvium, and elevations are
similar to those of the occurrence on calcareous terrain. Although it lies in
mountainous terrain, maximum elevations in the watershed are only moderate by
Appalachian standards. All our inventory traverses but one were in proximity to
the stream, here fictitiously called &quot;Main Branch&quot;, but one also
crossed the &quot;Side Branch&quot; that joins Main Branch from the northwest
and passed through upland forest for a distance. The main body of<i>Hydrastis</i>
occupies the alluvial terrace, but the plant is also abundant in places on the
natural levee of Main Branch. 
<p> A mature but not old closed canopy forest occupies the Main Branch
Valley and this forest is dominated by mesic species. In most areas of our
inventories Tuliptree appears to be the
most common species, but in some areas Beech is equally important. White Pine
is more conspicuous than abundant as large isolated trees. Of less importance
but common are Red Maple, Black Birch, White Ash, Black Gum, Black Locust, Black
Cherry, American and White Basswoods, Canada Hemlock, Cucumbertree (<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>), Sassafras, Black Walnut,
Slippery Elm and Sycamore along streams. Oaks are relatively unimportant, but
Northern Red, Black and White Oaks occur, with the latter being most abundant
on bordering uplands. Shagbark Hickory (<i>Carya ovata</i>) is almost the only hickory identified and appeared to
occur mostly as seedlings and small saplings. A single Mockernut was however
seen in upland forest. American Chestnut sprouts have only a minor presence. Of
special interest is the scattered occurrence of Yellow Biirch (<i>Betula alleghaniensis</i>) and Butternut, both
with decided concentrations near the stream. Of equal interest is the presence
of a little Black Ash (<i>Fraxinus nigra</i>). 
<p>Understory species are Muscletree,
Flowering Dogwood, Downy Seviceberry and Alternate-leaf Dogwood (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i>) . Maple-leaf Viburnum
appears to be far and away the most common shrub, but there are also Coral
Berry, Black Haw Viburnum, Spice Bush, Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana), </i> Winterberry Holly (<i>Ilex verticillata</i>), a little azalea, likely Pinxter, and Beaked
Hazelnut (<i>Corylus cornuta</i>). Smooth Alder (<i>Alnus serrulata</i>) occurs along the stream and
there are Upland Low Blueberry and Deerberry 
in a few places. Vines are not prominent in this forest, but Virginia
Creeper and Poison Ivy are common as ground flora. Common Greenbrier is the
only woody greenbrier noted, and there is a little Bittersweet, Summer Grape
and Fox Grape (<i>Vitis labrusca</i>), with the latter apparently confined to the proximity of streams.
<p>Before discussing the inventories
in detail, we present a summary list of observed herbs. These are listed in the
approximate order in which they were first encountered during the traverses and
thus give some indication of association. Species marked with an * indicate
those which we did not encounter in our inventory of the calcareous terrain.
Note also, that in most of the text, in the interest of brevity, the scientific
genus name &quot;<i>Medeola</i>&quot;is substituted for the common name
&quot;Indian Cucumberroot&quot;.

<h2>
 The Late May Traverse Across Main Branch and the Terrace –
Details</h2>
<ul>
<p> Entering
the forest above the Side Branch confluence, we crossed Main Branch and moved
west across the terrace. At the stream crossing we noted Muscletree, Black Haw
Viburnum, Witch Hazel, New York and Christmas Ferns, Showy Orchid, Carrion
Flower, <i>Medeola</i>, Dwarf Iris and <i>Carex Scabrata.</i> On the terrace we
saw Hispid Buttercup, a blue-eyed
grass, Nodding Fescue and uncovered a Seal Salamander (<i>Desmognathus monticola</i>) under forest debris.
Continuing, we noted the abundance of Tuliptree, an azalea (likely Pinxter), 
Red Maple, Black Cohosh, Showy Skullcap, Hairy Bedstraw, Thimbleweed, Hog
Peanut, more <i>Medeola</i> and Miterwort. 
<p> Still
moving west on the terrace, we came under tall, young Tuliptrees with a ground
cover of Rattlesnake Fern, more Showy Orchid and Pale Indian Plantain. Delicate
Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>) was common on down boles.
<p> We now
reached the edge of the terrace at the base of a steep slope with an easterly
aspect. Here we saw the first Black Birch and a single Yellow Birch, perhaps
bespeaking an increase in moisture from colluvial sources. Other species were
Sensitive Fern, scattered small patches of Ground Pine, Nodding Fescue, May
Apple, the wedge grass <i>Trisetum 
pensylvanicum</i>, an indicator of abundant moisture, <i>Carex prasina</i>,
an inhabitant of &quot;wet woods and thickets&quot; (Strausbaugh and Core,
1977) ; as also is the coexisting <i>Carex laevivaginata</i>. With these were
Silvery Glade Fern, Beech, the fungi <i>Rickenella fibula</i> and <i>Hygrophorus 
margiatus,</i> Pennsylvania Bittercress, Virginia Creeper, Hog Peanut,
abundant Virginia Knotweed and common <i>Medeola</i>. We now heard an Ovenbird
(<i>Seiurus aurocapillus</i>) and
soon after saw our first patch of Tree Moss (<i>Climacium americanum</i>), which is usually an
indicator of rich, moist soils. Next seen was Lady Fern, then a little
Maidenhair Fern, a small clump of Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, White Wood Aster
and, on trees, the lichen <i>Lobaria 
pulmonaria</i>. Following these were a few unhealthy appearing Canada
Hemlock saplings and more Tree Moss. We now reached a small ravine in which
grew a single Sweet White Violet, Shining Clubmoss, Painted Trillium and the
fungus <i>Leccinum albellum</i>. A
Scarlet Tanager was heard here.
<p> Directing
our traverse toward the stream again, we encountered our first Ginseng, here
under Red Maple and with nearby Hog Peanut, Maple-leaf Viburnum, <i>Medeola,</i>
Virginia Strawberry and Mealy Bellwort. Immediately following was our first <i>Hydrastis,</i>
accompanied by a little of the forest
grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>;
then more Ginseng, a single mature Yellow Birch and Wild Comfrey. Also seen
here was a small frog, possibly a tree frog, on the forest floor. We next came
to an area in which the forest floor was dominated by Ground Pine, but with
some <i>Hydrastis</i> as well. The latter soon increased and formed large
patches with a sprinkling of Ginseng. As we again reached the stream, somewhat
upstream from our initial crossing, we noted a luxuriant growth of herbs,
including large, robust <i>Hydrastis</i> and very large Tasslerue.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul>
<h2>Early September Traverse North Along Main Branch – Details</h2>
<ul>
<p> This
traverse began in the area of greatest concentration of <i>Hydrastis</i> on the
terrace. It was then estimated that this plant occupied most of the area
covered by ground flora for a distance of perhaps 600feet (180 m) parallel to
the stream and 150 feet (46 m) perpendicular to it. Thus the area of major
concentration may be of the order of two acres (0.8 ha) . Additionally, many small
patches and individual plants of <i>Hydrastis</i> occur outside this major
concentration, Some patches of the plant in the major area of concentration are
of the order of 100 feet (30 m) across, and within them it forms 90% of the
ground flora.
<p> The canopy
in the major area of concentration of <i>Hydrastis</i> is dominated by
Tuliptree punctuated by large White Pine. Other canopy species are Beech, Black
Birch, Red Maple, Black Locust, Northern Red Oak, White Ash, Black Cherry of
poor form, Cucumbertree, Black Walnut, Sassafras, a few Yellow Birch, Shagbark
Hickory and Black Oak, with the last two practically confined to seedlings.
Muscletree dominates the understory, but Flowering Dogwood and Downy
Serviceberry also occur.
<p> Although
Spice Bush and Black Haw Viburnum may be the most conspicuous shrubs,
Maple-leaf Viburnum is almost omnipresent as seedlings and small plants,
although these appear to be less frequent within the <i>Hydrastis</i> patches.
While Coral Berry too is widespread, it is not as common, nor does it attain
the large size that it does in calcareous terrain. Next to Virginia Creeper and
Poison Ivy, Common Greenbrier appears to be the most common vine. The little
Summer Grape observed appeared to be concentrated near the stream.
<p><i> Hydrastis</i> was observed
to extend virtually to the base of a 34 inch (0.86 m) dbh White Pine (see
later for a pH determination here) . Other herbs within the <i>Hydrastis</i>
patches included very common Virginia Knotweed, blooming White Wood Aster, Hog
Peanut, Scattered Wingstem, Hairy Sweet Cicely, Tall Agrimony, White Avens,
Mealy Bellwort, Ginseng, Rattlesnake Fern, Lopseed in seed, Bottlebrush Grass,
Carrion Flower, IndianTurnip, <i>Desmodium 
nudiflorum</i>, Honewort, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Field Basil, Downy
Wood Violet and <i>Panicum boscii.</i>
<p>Herbs less clearly associated with<i>
Hydrastis </i>are Christmas Fern, Ground Pine in patches that interdigitate
with it, Cutleaf Grapefern, <i>Medeola</i>, Common Speedwell, Ebony Spleenwort,
Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, a very little Intermediate Shield Fern, Spotted
Wintergreen and Shining Clubmoss. Red Maple seedlings appear to be more common
outside the patches. Mosses noted were Delicate Fern Moss, one or more species
of <i>Hypnum</i> on down boles, <i>Mnium affine</i> and an unidentified <i>Entodon</i>
on rocks.
<p>Pileated Woodpeckers were heard, a
Gray Treefrog (<i>Hyla 
versicolor/chrysocelis</i>) called once and a male Box Turtle was found in the area.
<p>As we moved north from the main <i>Hydrastis</i>
patches, we encountered a small Beech sapling with numerous large, white wooly
aphids that covered a 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) thick branch. These aphids waved
their posteriors vigorously in the air. An associated fungus may have resulted
from honeydew. Another fungus on the ground in the vicinity was an unidentified
species of <i>Suillus</i>. 
<p>We now reached the cobble levee
that bordered Main Branch and noted again that <i>Hydrastis</i> in this
environment was the most robust of any ever seen by us. As far as we could
determine by a rather cursory examination, individual plants of the species
were not connected by rhizomes, but at least five leaf scars were present on
some of them. Other species on the levee were Tall Meadowrue, Wood Nettle,
abundant large Christmas Fern, Tall Coneflower, Tree Moss, Spice Bush, Virginia
Knotweed, White Ash, Calico Aster and Sweet White Violet. Although not recorded
here, Tasslerue had been found in a similar location along this stream on our
May visit.
<p>Farther along the stream edge were
Lettuce Saxifrage, abundant <i>Carex scabrata</i>, Great Blue Lobelia in bloom, Golden Ragwort, False
Nettle, Clearweed, Spotted Jewelweed, also in bloom, and a Yellow Birch
sapling.
<p>On higher ground again, and with
little or no <i>Hydrastis</i> in view, we saw the fungi <i>Naematoloma fasciculare</i> on buried White Pine, <i>Scleroderma citrinum, Mycena haematopus</i> and <i>Amanita virosa</i>; then an unidentified species of <i>Hypnum</i>
moss on a down bole, a two foot (0.6 m) dbh Tuliptree, an unexpected single
plant of Crested Shield Fern, Small Coralroot Orchid, Cutleaf Grapefern, a
little <i>Hydrastis</i>, an unidentified <i>Lepiota</i> fungus, Curtis
Goldenrod, an 11 inch (0.28 m) dbh Beech and Beech Drops in bloom.
<p>As our traverse once again took us
to the stream edge, we noted there <i>Scirpus pollyphyllus</i>, Winterberry Holly, Lady Fern, Silvery Glade
Fern, Shining Clubmoss, Sensitive and Interruped Ferns, Smooth Alder, more
Crested Shield Fern, Great Chickweed, a 16 inch (0.41 m) dbh Beech and Wood
Reed Grass.
<p>Then, once more ascending the
terrace slope, we saw the fungus <i>Collybia confluens</i>, a saprophyte on fallen leaves, abundant <i>Medeola</i>,
Downy Rattlesnke Plantain, Deertongue Grass, Bushy Panic Grass and unidentified
<i>Xerula </i>and <i>Leccinum</i> fungi.
<p>The Valley now narrowed greatly and
the canopy consisted of Beech, Tuliptree, Red Maple, large White Pine, Black
and Yellow Birches and Hemlock. Also seen were the moss<i>Bryoandersonia illecebra</i> and a large (3.5 inch/ 9 cm
), faintly striped dark brown millipede with no detectable odor (<i>
Narceus americanus </i>?) . These were
followed by an unidentified <i>Psathyrella</i> fungus, a 19 inch (0.48 m) dbh
Beech (very healthy appearing, as were all Beech in the area) ; also abundant
Ground Pine and <i>Medeola,</i> common Yellow Birch and the fungi <i>Pluteus cervinus</i> and Green Stain (<i>Chlorociboria
 aeruginascens</i>) with
fruiting bodies – both on decaying wood. Another spot inventory of the canopy
yielded, in order of importance, Beech, Tuliptree, Black and Yellow Birches
and, in the distance, on the bordering west slope, a very large White Oak with
spreading crown.
<p>Continuing up-valley we saw the
mosses <i>Dicranum scoparium </i>and an
unidentified <i>Hypnum </i>on rock; then a single 9 inch (0.23 m) Butternut,
followed by Shagbark Hickory, the inedible &quot;Cheese Polypore&quot; (<i>Tyromyces chioneus</i>) fungus, Partridge Berry in
fruit, White Wood Aster in bloom and Silvery Glade Fern. At a seep were Fowl Manna Grass, an unidentified
Spikerush (<i>Eleocharus</i> sp), an
unidentified <i>Atrichum</i> moss, a 15 inch (0.38 m) dbh Yellow Birch, New
York Fern and a peculiar &quot;epiphytic&quot; fungus that resembled a sponge
on a twig. 
<p> Our
traverse, which had extended up-valley for perhaps ¼ mile (0.4 km), had been
confined to the west side of the stream. On our return south we made a few
additional observations on the stream's east side. These included a 25 inch (
0.64 m) dbh Beech, a Black Gum, Wild Sarsaparilla, Pinesap and the first noted
blueberries, namely Deerberry and Upland Low Blueberry.
<p> Additional
fungi collected on this traverse and identified by R. Hunsucker are as follows:

<h2>Early September Traverse 
South Across Side Branch – Details
</h2>
<ul> Our traverse
to the south began at about 10:00 AM at the origin of our previous day's
traverse to the north. Our traverse began by observing a Northern Cricket Frog
(<i>Acris crepitans</i><b> </b>)
hopping across the forest floor. We then successively observed the following
species as we moved south: Maple-leaf Viburnum, Ebony Spleenwort, Broad-glumed
Brome Grass, possible Showy Orchid, Wild Liquorice, seedlings of White Oak –
all more or less associated with <i>Hydrastis</i>. Then entering a more
elevated area, we saw an unidentified <i>Crepidotus </i>fungus under a 32 inch
 (0.81 m) dbh White Pine, with scattered <i>Hydrastis</i> in pine needle duff;
then a 32 inch dbh Tuliptree followed by leaf rosettes of Philadelphia Fleabane, an Alternate-leaf
Dogwood, the fungi <i>Suillus 
granulatus</i> and <i>Suillus 
americanus,</i> both species being commonly associated with White Pine (
Phillips, 1991) . These were followed by Round-leaved Pyrola near White Pine, <i>Carex virescens</i> and Beaked Hazelnut near a 37
inch (0.94 m) dbh White Pine. Here also a mouse or vole was observed running
across the forest floor. Next seen was <i>Carex gracillima</i>, the deciduous Spinulose Shield Fern <i>Dryopteris carthusiana,</i> the fungus <i>Hygrophoropsis
 aurantiaca</i> (partial to
decaying conifers), the mosses <i>Rhynchostegium serrulatum</i> on soil and<i>Rhodobryum roseum</i> on rock and Downy Serviceberry in
the understory. A spot inventory here also yielded Tuliptree, Black Birch, Red
Maple, Beech, Black Locust and Shagbark Hickory in the canopy and Muscletree in
the understory, while the ground flora included, in addition, Canada Brome
Grass, Nodding Fescue, <i>Carex 
laxiflora</i> and a little <i>Hydrastis</i>.
<p> We soon reached an old tote road along which
we found Wingstem, Pale Indian Plantain, Horse Balm, Autumn Bent Grass,
Bottlebrush Grass, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod and the fungi <i>Crucibulum leave</i> and <i>Lycoperdon perlatum</i>.
<p> As we
arrived at Side Branch we noted a 15 inch (0.38 m) dbh Yellow Birch on the
stream bank with Sycamore, Red Maple and a 10 inch ( 0.25 m) Muscletree. Moving upstream for a short distance, we saw
<i>Carex scabrata</i>, Water Hemlock,
very abundant Tree Moss and a Dusky Salamander ( <i>Desmognathus </i> sp) 
in the stream bed, while the far bank
was occupied by Northern Red Oak, abundant Christmas Fern and Delicate Fern
Moss as the dominant moss. Also seen in the general area were Witch Hazel, Lady
and Sensitive Ferns, abundant Tree Moss, Wood Reed Grass, Miterwort,
Thimbleweed, Purple-stem Aster and a Black Walnut. A single Mockernut Hickory
stood on a nearby elevation.
<p> We now
began to cross a more steeply sloping terrace or bench to the south of Side
Branch. The canopy here was dominated by Tuliptree, with Black Birch, Beech,
Cucumbertree and White ash, while Flowering Dogwood and saplings of White Pine and Red Maple formed an
understory. A single Chestnut Oak sapling, the only representative of the
species observed in the area, was seen here. Seedlings of Shagbark Hickory,
Black Oak and Red Maple were common, as was Maple-leaf Viburnum. Hog Peanut and
<i>Medeola</i> were conspicuous in the ground flora.
<p> We next
came to a shallow swale in which lay a foot (0.3 m) thick, very long down bole
entirely covered by Delicate Fern Moss. Also seen were an unidentified hot tasting <i>Lactarius</i> fungus, a 27
inch (0.69 m) dbh Tuliptree, Wild Liquorice, a Red-bellied Woodpecker, Ground
Pine, <i>Medeola</i>, generally abundant Tuliptree, seedlings of basswood and
hawthorn, Virginia Knotweed, Cutleaf Grapefern, delicateFern Moss on rock,
Black Haw Viburnum, Muscletree and a single plant of <i>Hydrastis</i>.
<p> Moving
onward, we continued to see abundant Tuliptree, with White Pine, Black Cherry
of characteristic crooked form, Black Locust, the fallen remains of American
Chestnut, Flowering Dogwood, Poison Ivy, more Small Coralroot orchid, a 36 inch
 (0.9 m) dbh White Pine and fungi that included an unidentified species of <i>Pholiota
</i>and the edible <i>Xerula fufuracea</i>
and <i>Suillus pictus</i>.
<p> We now came
to a springbrook at which we saw Great Blue Lobelia in bloom, Golden Saxifrage,
Lettuce Saxifrage and, virtually on the springbrook bank, a dense, five meter
square patch of <i>Hydrastis</i>. Nearby in a low area there was Slippery Elm,
Scouring Rush and a large vine of Fox Grape with ripe, tart but quite flavorful
grapes.
<p> Additional
fungi collected on this traverse and identified by R. Hunsucker are as follows:

<p><i>Agaricus</i> sp
<br><i>Hygrophorus 
cantharellus</i><br>
<i>Hygrophorus flavescens</i>
<br><i>Hygrophorus 
marginatus</i>
<br><i>Inonotus radicatus</i>
<br><i>Leccinum</i> sp
<br><i>Mycena </i>sp<i></i>
<br><i>Panellus 
stipticus</i>
<br><i>Phaeolus 
schweinitzii</i>
<br><i>Psathyrellus </i> sp
<br><i>Stereum ostrea</i>
<br><i>Tricholoma 
aurantium</i>
<p> 
</ul>
<h2>Mid-July Traverses – Details</h2>
<ul> At about
10:30 AM, under hazy skies and cool temperatures, a foray was made to the
vicinity of the largest <i>Hydrastis</i> patches with the chief purpose of
collecting soil samples for pH determinations. After noting the presence of two
Box Turtles in the area, the first sample (no 1) was collected from a depth
of 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) under a large White Pine and among <i>Hydrastis</i>.
Other species within a few meters included Maple-leaf Viburnum, Poison Ivy,
Spice Bush, a Beech sapling, Muscletree, <i>Medeola</i>, Tuliptree, and Ebony
Spleenwort. Delicate Fern Moss was the most conspicuous bryophyte. On drying,
this soil sample, which was apparently quite rich in organic matter, appeared,
from its lack of coherence, to be silty. It had an initial pH of 5.5 and 5.4
twenty-four hours later. It should be kept in mind that soil here is confined
to narrow interstices between cobbles and boulders so that profiles are
difficult to observe. However it everywhere had a &quot;rich &quot; appearance,
with organic matter well integrated with mineral matter.
<p> Species
noted in a nearby large patch of<i>Hydrastis</i> were abundant Virginia
Knotweed, somewhat stunted Tall Agrimony with a few blossoms, <i>Desmodium</i> <i>nudiflorum</i>, scattered Wingstem,
Smooth Sweet Cicely and seedlings of Shagbark Hickory. Associated mature trees
were Red Maple, American Basswood and White Ash.
<p> Sample no2
was taken from a depth of 2-3 inches next to Downy Rattlesnake Plantain in
association with sweet cicely, Hog Peanut and Wild Liquorice<i>. Hydrastis </i> occurred at a distance of a foot from the
sample area. This sample had an initial pH of 5.8 and 24 hours later 5.7.
<p> Other
species seen within a nearby <i>Hydrastis</i> patch were Mealy Bellwort,
stunted Rattlesnake Fern and stunted
and defoliated Coral Berry.
<p> Sample no3
was taken from, as usual, a 2-3 inch depth in a &quot;rich&quot; appearing
semi-opening with abundant Wingstem, blooming White Vervain, Hog Peanut, Spice
Bush and other mesic herbs. Black Walnut and a patch of <i>Hydrastis</i> were
nearby. This soil sample yielded an initial pH of 5.8 and, after 24 hours, 5.7.
<p> It may be
significant that, as distinguished from its occurrence on calcareous substrate,
very few of the <i>Hydrastis</i> plants anywhere here bore fruit, perhaps a
consequence of the generally deep shade, more acidic substrate or greater
competition. Also, the only bird seen or heard on this foray was a Red-eyed
Vireo.
<p> In the late
afternoon a return was made to the vicinity of the <i>Hydrastis</i> patches,
but this time on their western fringe where we had seen the most Ginseng. A
soil sample (no 4) was then taken from close to a plant of Ginseng from a
depth of 2-3 inches and among<i>Hydrastis,</i> with nearby <i>Medeola</i>, Red
Maple, Indian Turnip, Muscletree, Wild Comfrey and <i>Entoloma murrai</i>, a fungus said to inhabit
&quot;damp woods and swamps&quot; (Phillips, 1991) . An initial pH value of
5.9 was obtained, but after 24 hours this had increased to 6.2.
<p> A second
sample (no5) was also taken from next to another Ginseng plant with Spice
Bush in close proximity. Also noted in the general vicinity were Spotted
Wintergreen, Tall Bellflower in bloom and the deadly fungus <i>Amanita virosa</i>. This sample proved to have an
initial pH of 5.9, with no later determination made. It appears that, as in
calcareous terrain, pH in the vicinity of Ginseng is slightly but consistently
higher than is general in the vicinity of <i>Hydrastis.</i> 
<p> On the
following sunny but cool morning we initiated a traverse a little north of the
major <i>Hydrastis</i> occurrence in the edge of the upland forest to the east
of the stream. This forest was dominated by Beech, mostly small, but in some
trees attaining 2 feet (0.6 m) dbh or more. Black Birch, usually not over a
foot (0.3 m) dbh, was also common, and large White Pine were scattered
throughout. Other species were Red Maple, Cucumbertree, Witch Hazel a few
American Chestnut sprouts, Upland low Blueberry, Maple-leaf Viburnum, Partridge
Berry and scattered Spotted Wintergreen and Downy Rattlesnake Plantain. Now
descending again to the stream side, we noted a canopy dominated by Beech, Black Birch and
Tuliptree. but with scattered Yellow Birch. Other species were Black Gum, Spice
Bush, Tasslerue, abundant Lady and Christmas Ferns, <i>Carex Scabrata,</i>
common<i>Medeola </i>and<i></i> a
patch of Moccasin Flower. Moving downstream, we suddenly came upon several
small saplings of Black Ash. One of these saplings, with a stem diameter of an
inch (2.5 cm) stood in the shallow bed of a springbrook next to a much larger Black Birch on the spring
bank. An unidentified<i>Habenaria</i> orchid grew nearby. Water from this
springbrook was found to have a pH of 6.2.
<p> Continuing
downstream across a low terrace west of the stream, we saw round-leaf Pyrola in bloom, abundant Virginia Knotweed;
then on the stream bank, patches of Tree Moss inter-grown with Partridge Berry. These were followed
successively by the Old Man of the
Woods (<i>Strobilomyces floccopus</i>
) fungus, patches of an unidentified <i>Atrichum</i> moss, a little Shining
Clubmoss and the fungus<i>Cantharellus 
cinnabarrinus</i>, which occurred as numerous bright red, tiny mushrooms
distributed along the very edge of the stream bank for a considerable distance.
<p> Next seen
was an unidentified <i>Clitocybe</i> fungus, Tall Meadowrue, the moss <i>Mnium cuspidatum</i> and the thallus liverwort <i>Conocephalum conicum</i> with an unidentified<i>Porella</i>
liverwort in the stream bed. Also present here was an unidentified species of
the moss<i>Brachythecium</i>, as well as <i>Hypnum curvifolium</i>. In places in proximity to the stream the manna
grass <i>Glyceria melicaria</i> formed
dense patches and <i>Carex laxiculmis</i>
was a common sedge. Birds heard and/or seen here included a Wood Pewee (<i>
Contopus virens</i>), a Rufus-sided
Towhee and a Blue Jay.
<p> Lady and
Christmas Ferns continued particularly abundant and New York and Silvery Glade
Fern were both common. Accompanying these were Mealy Bellwort, the mosses<i>
Anomodon attenuatus </i>on the base of
a large Tuliptree, Delicate Fern Moss and an unidentified <i>Atrichum</i> on
soil. Also present was somewhat stunted Wood Nettle; then a few Hemlock, Yellow
Birch, Summer Grape and a few plants of Bittersweet on the ground but no vines. Here also there was a single plant of
what appeared to be the grape fern <i>Botrychium biternatum</i>. We now began to see Butternut, one of which was
15 inches (0.38 m) dbh and quite healthy in appearance. With these were
Tasslerue, Muscletree, Small Green Wood Orchid in bloom, Cowbane and the fungus
<i>Amanita vaginata.</i> These
were followed by Cinnamon Fern, Groundnut, Winterberry Holly, Crested Shield
Fern; then another healthy appearing Butternut at 18 inches (0.56 m) dbh. In
a more than usually moist spot grew tall <i>Carex gynandra,</i> unidentified jewelweed, White Ash and a vigorous
vine of Fox Grape with green fruit. A soil sample (no 6) was taken from a low
mucky area near the Fox Grape. This soil yielded an initial pH of 5.8, but 24
hours later this had decreased to 5.4.
<p> On again
reaching the area of large <i>Hydrastis</i> patches, we noted the edible fungus
<i>Pluteus admirabilis</i>, as well as
a species of <i>Melanoleuca</i>., American Self-heal ; and near the <i>Hydrastis</i>,
the white coral fungus <i>Ramariopsis 
kunzei</i>, a species partial to humus.
<p> After
observing an over-flight of what appeared to be two calling Sandhill Cranes (<i>Grus canadensis</i>) in the afternoon of the
same day, we began another traverse up Main Branch. The first part of this traverse was through
upland forest, again on the valley's east side, but farther upslope than
before. The forest here was open and dominated by Beech, most of which was
mature but not large. Accompanying it were larger White Pine, Northern Red and
White Oaks and Tuliptree. One White Pine measured 34 inches (0.86 m) dbh,
while a White Oak attained 36 inches (0.91 m) .Also present, and generally of
smaller sizes, were Red Maple and Black Birch. There were few shrubs and little
ground flora. Partridge Berry was concentrated under White Pine and Beech Drops
were noted. The traverse through the
upland forest was terminated perhaps ¼ mile (0.4 km) above the major<i>
Hydrastis</i> patch and a return traverse was begun downstream.
<p> Noted first
near the stream was a patch of vigorous Clintonia, likely the White species;
then Yellow Birch, Cancerroot, a patch of Tree Moss / Partridge Berry
intergrowth at the stream edge, abundant Christmas Fern and Poison Ivy. A soil
sample (no 7) was taken on an adjacent terrace west of the stream. This
sample had an initial pH of 5.7, but 24 hours later it was 5.5. Next seen on
our progress downstream was the only vine of Passion Flower seen on any of our
traverses. Also in the vicinity were Basil Balm, Broad Beech Fern with abundant
Lady Fern and the fungus <i>Galiella 
rufa. </i>On the nearby stream bank we saw a small patch of Tree
Clubmoss, the only occurrence of this species seen in the area. Also noted here was the abundance of Beech,
mostly small. but including 18 inch (
0.44 m) and 22 inch (0.55 m) veterans. Black Birch, Downy Rattlesnake
Plantain and Common Greenbrier were also conspicuous. Here we reached a
springbrook that discharged into the stream from the west. Recorded in the
vicinity was a 32 inch (0. 81 m) Tuliptree, as well as Plume Lily and Witch
Hazel, both of which we had earlier observed in scattered occurrences along the
stream.
<p> There
appeared to be few tree seedlings in this forest and, as observed earlier,
Water Hemlock and the Tree Moss – Partridge Berry intergrowth were common near
the stream, as was also Virginia Creeper. Other features of this spot included
the only Royal Fern encountered by us, the abundance of seedlings and small
plants of Indian Turnip, common but isolated patches of Ground Pine and the
excellent edible mushroom <i>Cantharellus 
fallax</i>.
<p> We ended
our traverse by taking a water sample of Main Branch. This sample proved to
have a pH a little above 6.0, perhaps 6.1 or 6.2, values in agreement with
that obtained for the springbrook earlier and for other streams in the area. A
mental note had also been made of a general feature of all our traverses on
this terrain, namely the abundance of small lepidoptera, which, while quite
substantial, did not seem as great as on calcareous terrain.

<h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
 
<p> The
habitats of the two occurrences of <i>Hydrastis</i> discussed here are quite
different in terms of physical setting, chemical character of substrate and the
enveloping floras. While the occurrence on calcareous terrain occupies a rather
steep, southeast slope in dry mesic forest, that on granitic terrain occupies a
gently sloping terrace in moist mesic forest. The canopy of the former is
dominated by oaks and hickories, whereas that of the latter consists
overwhelmingly of mesic species such as Tuliptree, Beech, birches and Red
Maple. In general character the enveloping floras of the occurrence on
calcareous terrain are southern Appalachian, with only a few species of
markedly northern distribution. By contrast those on granitic terrain have a
generous component of northern or cool climate species such as Yellow Birch,
Black Ash, Crested Shield Fern, Painted Trillium and Wild Sarsaparilla, as well
as numerous moisture dependents like Indian Turnip, Wood Nettle, Horse Balm,
Indian Cucumberroot and a variety of ferns that were not part of the floras on
calcareous terrain. Sedges and grasses in particular differ greatly in the two
occurrences, Only <i>Carex laxiflora </i>among sedges was identified in
both; while the 16 and 14 grasses recorded in the calcareous and granitic
terrains respectively had only three clearly identified species in common. This
may however in part reflect our limited surveys, particularly on the granitic
terrain.
<p> While the
calcareous terrain includes some highly acidic enclaves, the granitic terrain
appears less, if more uniformly, acidic. Measured soil pH on the calcareous
terrain ranges from 4.4 to 8.0. Although our pH determinations on the granitic
terrain are few in number, the values obtained, in conjunction with the
observed vegetation, lead us to believe that they generally lie between 5.5 and
a little more than 6.0. This conclusion is most strongly supported by the
spring and stream waters, which yield the higher values. It seems reasonable
that the lower values obtained for soils, result from vertical acid leaching.
The apparent absence of pH values as low as those from the calcareous terrain
may be a consequence of the absence of highly siliceous rocks such as chert and
the relatively subdued microtopography. It may also be an artifact of our
failure to sample near the few occurrences of blueberries that we saw in the
granitic terrain. A likely contributing factor on the granitic terrain is the
ready availability of bases. Granite undergoing weathering might be expected to
be a constant source of potassium, sodium and calcium ions, since these
elements are abundant in granitic minerals such as feldspar. Magnesium, on the
other hand, is likely to be less abundant than in calcareous rock.
<p> The
distribution of a number of species in the two areas of <i>Hydrastis </i>occurrence
provide, in terms of pH and available moisture, additional information on their
stability fields. Reference is here made to diagrams of inferred stability
relations (Mueller, 2000) based on a variety of field occurrences. From these
diagrams it appears that in both occurrences Red Maple ranges to its upper pH
limit, and the same is true of Beech in granitic terrain. The common
associations of Beech, White Ash and Red Maple on the latter is consistent with
moderately acidic, moist soils. The virtual absence of Chestnut Oak (only one
sapling seen) may also be a consequence of high soil moisture. The absence of
Sugar Maple on the granitic terrain is not as easily explained however.
Although this maple's inferred stability field has been placed at slightly
lower soil moisture levels than that of Beech, its apparent total absence here
is more likely a result of other factors – perhaps biological, such, as among
others, unfavorable mycorhizal associations. Because of their rarity, knowledge
of the stability fields of Goldenseal and Ginseng is of special interest.
However this rarity militates against seeing these species throughout their
ranges in habitat. Both plants appear to be quite demanding of nutrients and
well developed mull type soils. While found in both moist and dry mesic
habitats, as documented here, their moisture limits are not established. The
same is true of pH, although in terms of the limited measurements of this
parameter reported here, as well as all unreported observations of this
reporter, the upper pH limit of
Ginseng appears to lie above 7.0. The even more limited observations of
Goldenseal, may indicate a slightly lower pH range for this species, but this
is little more than conjecture.
<p> The limited
occurrence of heath family shrubs and certain other acidiphiles on the granitic
terrain may be a consequence of a
relatively high base content of the ground water and the deeper soils, placing
them outside the stability fields of rhododendrons and Mountain Laurel. We do
gain further insight into the stability relations of Spotted Wintergreen and
Downy Rattlesnake Plantain. As previously surmised, the upper pH limit of the
former appears to lie a little below 6.0 in most environments in which it has
been observed, perhaps a little below that of Red Maple. However here this
species also appears stable under moist mesic 
conditions, in which it has not been previously seen by this reporter.
Additionally, our observations here apparently extend the upper pH stability
limit of Downy Rattlesnake Plantain to only a little below 6.0 as well – also
in contradiction of this reporter's previous view of the matter.
<p>
 Considering now the bryophytes  of the Granitic Substrate, we note a  contrast with those of the Calcareous Substrate of the Oak-Hickory Ridge Forest of the Folly Mills Watershed. If C represents the number of taxa in common with our standard of comparison, the Mesic Slope Forest of the Folly Mills Watershed, and T the total number of taxa in the Granitic Substrate bryophyte assemblage, the index of similarity CxC / T is 4.5, while that of the Calcareous Substrate is 4.1 (<a href=follymills.htm>see our section on the Folly Mills Watershed</a>).


<p> A word also
needs to be said about the herbal and medicinal properties of Goldenseal. As
pointed out earlier, this plant is strongly shunned by all herbivores in the
occurrences observed by us. To this reporter there is a message here regarding
its suitability for internal human consumption. This caution is also supported
by Russell <i>et al</i> (1997) who state that it &quot;causes only low
toxicity if eaten&quot; but &quot;all parts&quot; are regarded as poisonous. A
toxic principle of the plant includes Isoquinolin alkaloids, and these authors
discourage its use for self medication. Of course, this in no way invalidates
the potential of Goldenseal for medical use. However, it appears that this use
has not as yet been adequately explored in a scientific way. Additional
