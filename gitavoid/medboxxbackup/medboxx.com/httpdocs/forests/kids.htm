 <h2>What is a Forest?</h2><ul>
 
<p>A forest is
more than a collection of trees. While trees are generally so big
that they fill our eyes, a forest also includes all the wild flowers,
ferns, mosses and mushrooms present, as well as all the animals, 
birds and microscopic life-such as bacteria- in it. It includes the
soil out of which it grows, and even the atmosphere that circulates
through it. All these parts are linked to each other. Which brings us
to ecology.</p>
<p>
</ul><h2>What is Ecology?</h2><ul>
<p>
<p>According to
one dictionary (<i>American Heritage</i>) ecology &quot;is the
science of the relationships between organisms (living things) and
their environment&quot;. Of course, this also includes mutual

relationships among the organisms themselves. Also, while some of
these relationships are of the family type, as between parents and

children, others involve food, shelter and other interactions with
the environment. For example, some small trees are specially suited

to grow in the shade of large trees, and some wild flowers on the
forest floor can bloom only in the early spring, before tree leaves

appear to rob them of light.</p>



</ul><h2>What is a Species? </h2><ul>


All living things fall into related groups and each organism has two

scientific names. The first of these names always begins with a
capital letter and indicates the &quot;genus&quot;, or smallest

grouping of related organisms, while the second name, which begins
with a small letter, refers to the &quot;species&quot;, or a

particular type of organism. Thus all maples fall in the genus <i>Acer</i>,
and the common Red Maple is Acer <i>rubrum</i>. Similarly, oaks fall

in the genus <i>Quercus, </i>and the<i> </i>White Oak is <i>Quercus 
alba</i>.. In some cases species are further divided into &quot;varieties&quot;

or &quot;sub-species&quot; on the bases of small variations in
appearance or other characteristics. There are also larger groupings

in this scientific classification. Thus a grouping of closely related
genra (the plural of genus) fall into the same &quot;family&quot;.

Still larger groupings are also part of the system, but are left to
the reader to look up. At this point we also arrive at the theory of

evolution, which states that those species survive and do best that
have the capacity (the right genes) to adapt to their environment

and can pass this capacity on to their offspring. A habitat. or
living place for a community of species, is said to have high

&quot;biological diversity&quot; when it contains a large number of
different species.</p>

<p>

</ul><h2>How Do Forests Differ?</h2><ul>

 
<p>There

are many different kinds of forests, and they fall into large groups.
A convenient grouping is to divide them into needle-leaf and

broad-leaf types. Familiar examples of the needle-leaf type are the
evergreen coniferous (seeds produced in cones) spruce (genus <i>Picea

</i>) and pine (genus <i>Pinus </i>) forests, which are so common in
cool climates. The &quot;deciduous&quot; (drop leaves in a season

such as autumn) hardwoods, like those of eastern North America, East
Asia and Europe, are examples of the broad-leaf type. However, some

needle-leaf types, such as the larches (genus <i>Larix</i>, also
known as tamaracks), drop their needles in the fall as well.

Additionally, many broad-leaf types, such as many species of the
tropics, are also evergreen. Here however, we discuss as examples

mainly the forests of eastern North America, since they are the most
familiar to this writer.</p>

<p>Forests
may also be divided into moist and dry climate types. Thus the

&quot;mesic&quot; (medium moist) as well as dry (also known as
&quot;xeric&quot;) deciduous forests are common types in the eastern

US. Tropical dry forests also drop their leaves, in this case, during
the dry season. Rain forests are extreme examples of the moist

climate type. Most familiar are those of the tropical regions, such
as the Amazon Basin, but some, composed of spruce, fir (genus <i>Abies

</i>), cedar (genus <i>Thuja </i>) as well as other conifers, also
occur along the northwest Pacific coast of the US (including Alaska) and Canada (Fowells, 1965). 
</p>

<p>Mesic
and dry forests have different species, or some of the same species

in different proportions. While the leaf cover of mesic forests tends
to be dense, that of dry forests is frequently thin, allowing more

light to reach the underlying vegetation and forest floor. Also, the
tree, shrub and non-woody plants { herbs }of mesic forests tend to

have thin, juicy leaves that decompose rapidly after death, while
those of dry forests are generally relatively thick and leathery and

are resistant to decay, so in dry forests the forest floor is usually
covered by a thick mat of dead leaves. This tends to create an acid

soil condition that discourages the lush non-woody plant growth that
is found in mesic forests. Examples of temperate climate mesic

forests are those with tree layers composed of maples, beech (genus
<i>Fagus</i>), birches (genus <i>Betula</i>) and basswoods (genus

 <i>Tilia</i>) Examples of dry forests are some composed dominantly
of oaks, hickories  (genus <i>Carya</i>)  and pines.</p>

<p>The
uppermost branches and leaves of a tree are known as the &quot;crown.&quot;

 Together the crowns of the tallest trees form the &quot;canopy&quot;,
which shades all lower trees and other plants. If the crowns of

individual trees are in contact with each other, they form a
&quot;closed-canopy&quot; forest, and when the crowns are separated,

the canopy is said to be &quot;open.&quot; When the separation is
great, the forest is called a &quot;woodland.&quot; 

</p>
<p>Trees

and other plants that grow in forests do not all tolerate shade
equally well. It is no surprise that many that comprise the

densely-foliaged mesic forests, such as the maples, beech and
basswoods, are among the most tolerant, while the oaks, hickories and

pines of the thinly-foliaged dry forests are among the least tolerant
However, this division is not absolute, since the most complex North

American mesic forests, the &quot;Mixed Mesophyte Type&quot; also
contains some quite shade intolerant trees such as Tuliptree (

<i>Liriodendron  tulipifera</i>)  and White Ash  (<i>Fraxinus</i> 
<i>americana </i>). These trees manage to grow in natural openings

formed by tree-falls, as discussed below. Additionally, some trees,
including White Ash, are quite tolerant of shade when they are still

seedlings and small saplings. This makes it possible for them to
survive until an opening appears.</p>

<p>

</ul><h2>Forest Stability and Equilibrium</h2><ul>
 

<p>	If a thing, such as a
forest, remains unchanged for a long time, we may suspect that it is

in equilibrium with its surroundings, that is, all forces which might
change it are balanced. However, there are different types of

equilibrium, namely stable and unstable  (we ignore a third type that
adds little to our explanation). We may illustrate with a small ball

and a bowl. If the ball is placed in the bowl and the latter is given
a slight push, the ball will roll part way up the bowl's side, but

will again come to rest in the bowl's center. This is an example of
stable equilibrium. If the bowl is now turned upside down and the

ball carefully balanced on the bottom, it will remain so until
disturbed. However, if the bowl is now pushed, the ball will roll

off, never to return. This illustrates unstable equilibrium. In the
case of a forest, or indeed any natural vegetation, a disturbance

such as a high wind or logging may wipe out part of the vegetation,
but in time the original type of vegetation will re-grow, although.

this may be preceded by a succession of unlike vegetation. This is an
example of stable equilibrium in nature. However, we can't think of

any example of unstable equilibrium in forest vegetation, since no
unstable system can remain unchanged for any length of time under

natural conditions. 
</p>

<p>	The best known example
of equilibrium in forests is the concept of the &quot;climax forest.&quot;

A climax forest is one in which  the vegetation has reached its
fullest development and death is balanced by reproduction. The mature

trees have an average age that is the maximum for the forest type,
and all plants reproduce themselves, although their proportions may

vary with time as a consequence of disturbances. There is a balance
between living and dead wood, and soils are mature and characteristic

of the forest type. Furthermore, there is a close relation between
the type of vegetation and the type of soil. Usually also, the soil

type is closely related to the underlying &quot;sub-soil&quot; or
rock. Exceptions are soils that have been altered by rainwater

leaching. When such forests have suffered little or no alteration by
humans they are called &quot;virgin&quot; and when they contain old

vegetation, such as their trees, they are classified as &quot;old
growth.&quot;</p>

<p>	We noted above that
the re-growth of mature vegetation is preceded by unlike vegetation.

The first of this vegetation to form after a disturbance is known as
&quot;early successional vegetation&quot; and usually consists of

non-woody plants, shrubs and tree seedlings. Many of its plants can
only grow in the abundant light of forest openings. This earliest

vegetation is soon   (on the scale of 5-10 years)  replaced by
vegetation somewhat like that of the original forest, and this in

turn by a forest with a species composition almost identical to the
original.</p>

<p>	Although stable
equilibrium is not difficult to consider in the case of the climax

forest, the concept  may also be applied to the rapidly changing
successional vegetation of a disturbed forest  (Mueller, 2000). 

Thus, if a forest that was adapted to and grew on acidic  (poor in
calcium and magnesium)  soils is cut, the first and all later

successional plants that replace it will also consist of species
adapted to such soils. Similarly, if a forest adapted to alkaline (

rich in calcium and magnesium)  soils is cut, all successional plants
will also consist of species adapted to these soils. Of course, it is

possible that in some cases the disturbance itself might bring about
a change in soil acidity or other factors, and thus change the floral

composition, as from alkaline to acidic, for example. Note that in
all cases these are examples of stable equilibrium between plants and

the soil in which they grow. The only difference from the equilibrium
of the climax forest is that it is established rapidly and lasts only

a short while for each successional stage.</p>
<p>
 

</ul><h2>Forest Disturbances</h2><ul>
 

<p>Forests
are subject to many disturbances, which include strong winds, fire,

ice, diseases and insects that feed on them. A common type of
disturbance is the &quot;blow-down&quot;, in which the wind up-roots

or breaks individual or a large number of trees. In the deciduous
forests of the eastern US, individual tree blow-down is the dominant

disturbance, but in the northern coniferous forests large blow-downs
and fire are much more important  (Runkle, 1996).  Insects and

diseases may cause great disturbances and kill many trees, and many
of the most destructive have been introduced by humans from overseas.

An example is a blight or disease of American Chestnut   (<i>Castanea
</i> <i>dentata</i>)  that eliminated the species as a canopy-sized

tree in our eastern forests, although it continues to send up
sprouts, Another is an insect that is killing our beautiful evergreen

hemlocks  (genus <i>Tsuga</i>)  practically everywhere in these same
forests. You may also have heard of Dutch Elm Disease that has

destroyed so many American Elms  (<i>Ulmus  americana</i>),  the
fungus that afflicts Flowering Dogwood  (<i>Cornus  florida</i>)  and

the Gypsy Moth, that, in its caterpillar stage, feeds on the leaves
of many trees. It should be mentioned that all these tree diseases

and insect parasites also have genus and species names, which we have
omitted only in the name of simplicity, but which may readily be

found in references such as the internet.</p>
<p>We

have seen that, while disturbances may be highly destructive and even
threaten the existence of certain species, others have adapted, with

beneficial results, as when openings created by disturbances let in
the light required by some species. Of particular importance is the

role of fire. Most destructive are &quot;crown fires&quot;, in which
flames leap from crown to crown in a &quot;firestorm&quot; of

destruction. Crown fires usually result from the accumulation on the
forest floor of debris from logging operations or from the absence of

ground fires for a long period in unlogged forests. Unfortunately,
humans have been late in recognizing the beneficial role of fire in

controlling natural  (not logging)  debris accumulation. Studies have
shown that when fire burns along the forest floor periodically, it

tends to be of low intensity and benefits the vegetation,
particularly in dry forests. Thus the seeding and growth of plants

such as blueberries  (genus  <i>Vaccinium</i>)  and huckleberries (
genus <i>Gaylussacia </i>) is aided in dry oak forests, to the

benefit of wildlife. 
</p>

<p>Many
plants and other organisms are adapted to fire. Some trees of eastern

North American forests, such as Chestnut <b>Oa</b>k  (<i>Quercus 
prinus</i>),  have adapted to periodic fires by developing, not only

thick bark, but a greater thickening of the underside bark of leaning
trees, where exposure to flames is greatest. Similarly, fire adapted 

pines such as the Pitch Pine  (<i>Pinus  rigida </i>) have developed
bark consisting of numerous thin layers to increase heat insulation.

These pines also have cones that open to release their seeds when
exposed to the heat of fires, thus assuring reseeding of burned

areas.</p>
<p>Not

all forests are subject to fire when in their natural condition. Thus
the lush coniferous rainforests of the northwestern US and Canada are

far too wet to burn under most conditions. Even in the eastern US,
the original high elevation virgin Red Spruce  (<i>Picea  rubens</i>) forests of West Virginia showed little evidence of fire as a
consequence of the cool, moist climate. However, when logging opened

up such forests and produced great quantities of dead wood debris,
they burned catastrophically. 

 

</p>
</ul><h2>Forest Animals</h2><ul>

 <p>

We have already
mentioned a number of forest animals, namely some of the insects.

However,  the usually most conspicuous are mammals, particularly tree
squirrels. Without discussing all of these, which number five common

species in eastern North America, we may consider one of the most
widespread, namely the Red Squirrel (<i>Tamiasciurus </i> <i>hudsonicus

</i>), which inhabits a wide variety of forests in the eastern US as
well as the coniferous forests of Canada. Another kind of tree

squirrel of special interest are the flying squirrels (genus
<i>Glaucomys </i>). These squirrels don't actually fly, but glide

from tree to tree or to the ground with the aide of a membrane they
spread between hind and front legs. An important ecological role of

squirrels is their habit of burying and otherwise spreading <i>seeds</i>
such as acorns and pine cones, and many trees and other plants have

seeds that evolved especially to appeal to squirrels. Squirrels are
also important spreaders of various mushrooms, many of which form

intergrowths with tree roots to the tree's advantage. 
<p>	Another forest animal

of great ecological importance is the Beaver, in America, <i>Castor </i>
<i>canadensis.</i> As is well known, the Beaver builds dams, which

have several purposes. The dams create ponds and raise the water in
all creeks that feed into them upstream. Since Beavers need to cut

trees for the bark they feed on, as well as for building material,
the raised water level allows them to reach many more trees. The dam

is constructed of interwoven sticks plastered with mud. Since Beavers
have a number of predators, major uses of the pond are to provide a

safe place for the Beaver house or &quot;lodge.&quot; to be built,
and as a storage site for the winter food supply, which., like the

lodge entrance, is in water deep enough so it will not freeze in the
coldest winter days. Additionally, the pond provides habitat for a

wide variety of animals, including fish, turtles, frogs and birds.
Beaver ponds are abandoned after a number of years, usually because

the local food supply has been used up. After the Beaver are gone,
the dam usually fails, since it requires constant repair. Following

this, the pond is replaced by a meadow, and new set of ecological
functions is initiated. Because  the former pond. was a catch basin

for so much life and its wastes, as well as forest debris, these
meadows have richer soils than those of the surrounding forest. Also,

their vegetation and the animals that live there are quite different
from those of the forest, with the result that the biological 

diversity of the entire area is increased..</p>
<p>	Many forests not long

ago had more species of animals, in particular large predators, such
as the Gray Wolf (<i>Canis  lupus</i>)  and large cats such as the

American Cougar (<i>Felis  concolor</i>),   than they now have. The
elimination of these large predators by humans has had a great

ecological impact, in that it allows small predators,  formerly
hunted by them, such as the Red Fox  (<i>Vulpes  vulpes</i>),  

skunks  (several genra)   and Raccoons  (<i>Procyon  lotor</i>)  to
flourish. Since all of these feed on birds, their eggs and a variety

of other small animals, the loss of the big predators is a major
cause for decreases in the populations of certain species, and most

particularly those of many of the rarest song birds.</p>
<p>	Another consequence of

the loss of the large predators is the increase in numbers of deer,
particularly the White Tail  (<i>Odocoileus  virginiana</i>)  of

eastern North America. The overpopulation of this animal is also a
consequence of overcutting of forests, which makes available for food

an abundance of early successional vegetation that springs up when
the trees are cut.. The additional deer also feed on rare plants of

the nearby uncut forest, and many, such as the beautiful evergreen
shrub Canada Yew  (<i>Taxus  canadensis</i>),  have practically been

eliminated in places in which they were once common. 
</p>

<p>	The overpopulation of
deer also poses a direct threat to human health, since one result is

the spread of an illness similar to mad-cow disease, that for a long
time has been  present over large parts of Western and Midwestern

North America, and recently has appeared in the East as well.</p>
<p>	Although mammals and

birds are the best known forest animals, there are many smaller and
generally concealed species,  such as salamanders, that play equally

important ecological roles.  Examples are the lungless woodland
salamanders, particularly of the genus <i>Plethodoni</i>, in eastern

North American forests. These salamanders seldom are seen in the
open, but comprise a large fraction of the vertebrate biomass  (the

mass or weight of living things)  in these forests. They also are
large consumers of the abundant small invertebrates that live on the

forest floor.</p>
</ul>
 <h2>Some

Examples from the Appalachian Forests</h2><ul>
 
</p>
<p>	The Appalachian

Mountains vary enough in latitude, bedrock, elevation, and topography
to allow a variety of forest types to occur in them. The major types

were originally classified and compared by the brilliant forest
ecologist Lucy Braun in her classic <i>Deciduous Forests of Eastern</i>

<i>North America</i> (1950),to which this reporter <i>is</i> greatly
indebted. Here we confine ourselves largely to the Southern and

Central Appalachians since they show the greatest variation in forest
types.</p>

<p>	The Southern and
Central Appalachians  fall in four physiographic provinces. the

Appalachian Plateaus, the Ridge and Valley, the Blue Ridge. and the
Piedmont. Of the four, our emphasis is largely on the first three,

since these include the mountains themselves and show the greatest
variation in the physical environment. The rocks of the Appalachian

Plateaus and the Ridge and Valley Regions are of Paleozoic age, while
those of the Blue Ridge and the Piedmont are mostly much older. Those

of The Appalachian Plateau have nearly flat-lying or slightly folded
beds, while those of the Ridge and Valley are mostly closely folded

and much faulted. All of the Paleozoic rocks are only slightly
metamorphosed (changed by heat and pressure), while those of the

Blue Ridge and the Piedmont are generally complexly folded and
faulted and are more highly metamorphosed. As might be expected, the

mountain peaks and ranges consist of hard, erosion-resistant rocks
such as sandstone, quartzite and granite, while the valleys have

formed in weaker rocks such as shales and limestones.</p>
<p>	A salient

characteristic of the Appalachians of Virginia, West Virginia and
Western Pennsylvania is the NE to SW orientation of the regional

isotherms, which is essentially parallel to the mountain ranges. In
Central Pennsylvania their orientation changes to roughly E-W, which

again approximates the orientation of the ranges there. Consequently,
regional temperatures in Virginia's Ridge and Valley generally

decrease from east to west and reach their lowest values on the
Allegheny Plateau of West Virginia. By contrast temperatures in

Central Pennsylvania decrease from south to north.</p>
<p>	Of the Appalachian

forest types the most complex and richest in species is the Mixed
Mesophyte Type, which we referred to earlier, and which is best

developed in the Cumberland Mountains of Kentucky,. but also occurs
in many other locations. It has as indicator trees White Basswood (<i>Tilia  heterophylla </i>) and Yellow Buckeye  (<i>Aesculus 
octandra</i>), which are usually accompanied by ten or more other

canopy species, as well as a number of small &quot;understory&quot;
trees, shrubs and hundreds of species of  herbs, including especially

ferns and colorful wildflowers. Some other canopy species are
American Beech  (<i>Fagus  grandifolia</i>),  Sugar and Red Maples,

Tuliptree, Northern Red Oak, Black Oak  (<i>Quercus  velutina</i>), 
Shagbark Hickory  (<i>Carya  ovata</i>), White Ash and Canada Hemlock

(<i>Tsuga </i> <i>canadensis</i>). Common understory trees and
shrubs are Hophornbeam  (<i>Ostrya  virginiana</i>),   Muscletree  (

<i>Carpinus  caroliniana</i>),  Striped Maple  (<i>Acer 
pensylvanicum</i>),.  Spicebush  (<i>Lindera</i>  <i>benzoin</i>) 

and Black Haw Viburnum  (<i>Viburnum  prunifolium</i>),  among
others.</p>

<p>	While herb species are
too numerous to list in detail, some immediately catch our eye. Among

these are May Apple  (<i>Podophyllum  peltatum</i>),  with its umbrella-like leaves, and the trilliums (genus <i>Trillium</i>),

with their large, colorful blooms in early spring. Impressive also,
are the many medicinal herbs, among them Black Cohosh  (<i>Cimicifuga

 racemosa</i>),  American Ginseng  (<i>Panax  quinquefolius</i>)  and
Goldenseal (<i>Hydrastis  canadensis </i>). 

</p>
<p>	Mixed Mesophyte

forests almost invariably occur on rugged, stream dissected
topography,  in the case of the Cumberland Mountains, on terrain with

several thousands of feet of relief. Their soils are frequently 
colluvial  (formed by down-slope movement)  in origin. Consequently

these soils have in most cases been in contact with, and include rock
fragments, and other soils from up-slope layers richer in nutrients.

In the bottoms of stream valleys and ravines they may also benefit
from deposits of alluvium (stream deposited sediments), which 

frequently bear nutrient-rich material from up-stream. When Mixed
Mesophyte forests occur on flatter terrain, abundant moisture and

beds of nutrient-rich material such as limestone, occur near the
surface. They also grade into less rich forests which we earlier

called simply &quot;mesic.&quot;</p>
<p>	Mesic forests in turn

grade into the Oak-Chestnut type, which characterizes the driest
ridges and slopes, The dominant tree in them currently is the

Chestnut Oak,  but Northern Red and Black Oaks and the hickories are
also important. Almost omnipresent is Red Maple, except in the driest

stands, where  Pitch Pine is common and is sometimes accompanied by
Table Mountain Pine  (<i>Pinus  pungens</i>)   Before the Chestnut

Blight the American Chestnut was frequently as important as the oaks
in this forest type.</p>

<p>	Because these dry
forests have thin and sometimes open canopies and inhospitable soils

that discourage herbs, shrubs frequently form dense layers beneath
the trees. Chief among these may be Witch Hazel  (<i>Hamamelis 

virginiana</i>),  or, in the most acidic soils, a variety of 
ericaceous species such as Mountain Laurel  (<i>Kalmia  latifolia</i>), Minnie-bush  (<i>Menziesia  pilosa</i>),   various deciduous
rhododendrons or azaleas,  blueberries and huckleberries. Also small

sub-shrubs with thick, evergreen leaves, such as Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria  procumbens</i>)  and Spotted Wintergreen  (<i>Chimaphila

 maculata</i>) are common, as is Bracken Fern  (<i>Pteridium 
aquilinum</i>).  While herbs are of scattered occurrence, a few,

such as Whorled Loosestrife  (<i>Lysimachia  quadrifolia</i>), 
Rattlesnake Weed   (<i>Hieracium  venosum</i>))  and Partridge Berry

 (<i>Mitchella  repens</i>)   regularly occur.</p>
<p>	Just as Mixed

Mesophyte forests are characteristic of rich colluvial slopes or
limestone valleys, the Oak-Chestnut type is typical of  linear or

winding ridges of hard sandstone or siltstone, with minor interbedded
shales. Where these ridges are cut by ravines, and somewhat more

nutrient-rich rocks are exposed, it grades into a more mesic type, in
which such species as  Tuliptree and the maples, as well as herbs are

common.</p>

<p>	The distribution of

the different species of oak illustrate well their relation to soils
and the underlying bedrock. As we have seen, Chestnut Oak generally

occurs on nutrient poor soils of sandstone ridges. However, a better
indicator of an environment favorable to this oak is soil acidity,

with the species being excluded by low acidity and high
concentrations of calcium and magnesium. This oak in fact does well

in quite rich, moist or mesic environments as long as soil acidity is
above a certain level. The opposite is however true of another member

of the genus, namely Chinquapin Oak  (<i>Quercus  muhlenbergii</i>), which demands soils with low acidity and high concentrations of

calcium and magnesium and is frequently confined to the vicinity of
limestone outcrops. A third species, the Black Oak, thrives in very

acidic as well as low acid soils and all acidities between these. All
three oaks have similar distributions with respect to latitude.

However, their distributions in longitude are markedly different (see distribution maps). The basis for this difference is related to

the prevalence of limestone bedrock and lime-rich soils west of the
Appalachians as well a decrease in rainfall westward, which leads to

greater concentrations of calcium and magnesium in upper soil layers.</p>
<p>

Chestnut Oak is confined to  eastern North America and virtually to
the generally highly acidic soils of the Appalachians and adjacent

regions. A minor but instructive feature of this oak's distribution
map is the conspicuous exclusion of the Kentucky Bluegrass, a region

notable for its limestone bedrock.. By contrast, although Chinquapin
Oak occurs in the East, in limestone areas, it also ranges as far

west as Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Black Oak is common throughout
the East and occurs virtually as far west as does Chinquapin Oak. It

thus seems clear that the geographic distribution of these three oaks
is a direct reflection of climatic conditions as well as their soil

preferences and tolerances. 
</p>

<p>	The distribution of
the Hemlock- White Pine- Northern Hardwoods forest type in the

Appalachians is governed largely by latitude and elevation. In the
Southern and Central Appalachians it is almost entirely confined to

the higher elevations, which in the south it may exceed 4000 feet (1200 meters) above sea level. However, in New York, New England and

Eastern Canada it is stable near sea level.</p>
<p>	Although they have

great prominence in the name of this forest type, Hemlock and White
Pine are generally subordinate in the Appalachians to northern

hardwoods such as Sugar and Red Maples, Beech, Yellow and Black
Birches and Northern Red Oak.</p>

<p>	Like the other forest
types discussed above, the species of trees as well as the flora in

general, reflect not only the climate but soil character. In
glaciated regions the composition of the underlying till  (glacially

eroded, ground up rock),  with respect to nutrients and acidity, is
important, while in un-glaciated areas bedrock character may

dominate. In many areas of eastern North America soils immediately
above limestone bedrock or lime-rich sub-soils, are nonetheless

acidic in character. This feature is the result of the downward
leaching of calcium and magnesium by rainwater, which is naturally

acidic as a consequence of its carbon dioxide content. Of course this
acidity may be further increased by industrial pollutants captured by

the rain from the air. These soil characteristics influence not only
the canopy species but all understory trees, shrubs and herbs.</p>

<p>	At higher elevations
and lower northward,  spruce of several species as well as Balsam Fir

 (<i>Abies  balsamea</i>)  may be present as minor components. While
deciduous understory trees are mostly of the same species throughout

the region, northerners such as Mountain Maple  (<i>Acer  spicatum</i>) have greater prominence in cooler environments. Shrubs also have

many species in common with other forest types. However some, such as
Hobblebush  (<i>Viburnum  alnifolium</i>),  distinguish this forest

type. Many herbs  are also of wide distribution, but many others,
such as Canada Mayflower  (<i>Maianthemum  canadense</i>), 

Goldthread  (<i>Coptis</i>  <i>groenlandica</i> }and Mountain
Woodfern  (<i>Dryopteris  campyloptera</i>)  occur only in cool

northern or montane {mountain } habitats.</p>
<p>	At even higher

elevations and northward, the Hemlock- White Pine- Northern Hardwoods
forest type grades into sub-alpine or boreal spruce-fir types. In the

Southern Appalachians of North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia,
Fraser Fir  (<i>Abies  fraseri</i>)  is endemic and occurs at the

highest elevations  In the Central Appalachians of West Virginia and
Virginia there is a variet<i>y of Balsam Fir </i>(<i> Abies  balsamea

 var,  phanerolepus </i>) that is<i> </i>distinguished from the
typical variety<i> Abies  balsamea  var  balsamea</i>,  which is

found from northern Pennsylvania northward. Red Spruce is associated
with all of these firs along the Appalachian chain, but the

proportion of fir generally increases with elevation. At the highest
elevations, where most spruce-fir forest occurs, these conifers

dominate almost to the exclusion of deciduous species. However,
Yellow Birch is a frequent minor component in the Southern and

Central Appalachians. 
</p>

<p>	Although Fraser Fir
occurs at the highest elevations in the Southern Appalachians and

under a severe climate, it does not occur farther north in similar
climates, even where Balsam Fir is absent. This characteristic is

held in common with a number of montane species. For example Southern
Mountain Cranberry  (<i>Vaccinium </i> <i>erythrocarpum </i>) is a

common high elevation and cool habitat shrub of the Southern and
Central Appalachians, but is found no farther north than West

Virginia. It may be that some factor such as light intensity may be
involved here.</p>

<p>	Other common
vegetation types that occur within the Hemlock-White Pine Northern

Hardwoods forests are the acidic bogs. In them the dominant tree is
usually a species of spruce, either Red Spruce, or more typically

Black Spruce  (<i>Picea  mariana</i>).  As distinguished from the
former, which is essentially montane in ditribution, Black Spruce is

boreal and ranges beyond the Arctic Circle. Commonly associated
conifers are Eastern Larch  (<i>Larix  laricina</i>)  and Balsam Fir.

While Red Spruce is the dominant bog tree species south along the
Appalachians in Virginia and West Virginia, it is joined by Black

Spruce in Central Pennsylvania, and this species  becomes more
frequent northward.</p>

<p>	An important feature
of acidic bogs is the number of northern species, of which Black

Spruce is only the most conspicuous. Especially abundant are northern
ericaceous shrubs such as Bog Rosemary  (<i>Andromeda  glaucophylla</i>) Labrador Tea  (<i>Ledum  groenlandicum</i>),  Leather-leaf (<i>Chamaedaphne  calyculata </i>) and Large and Small Cranberries (<i>Vaccinium  macrocarpon</i>   and  <i>V.  ozycoccos  </i>). Also
abundant are the lichens and  mosses, such as the numerous species of

the genus <i>Sphagnum</i> in particular. Although grasses are
present, sedges are more common, and one type, &quot;Cotton Grass&quot;

or more properly &quot;Cotton Sedge&quot;  (genus  <i>Eriophorum </i>)
is particularly conspicuous with its cottony seed heads in late summer.</p>
<p>	Northern bog species

can grow farther south than northern upland plants because bog soils
are naturally cool as a consequence of  water saturation, the

insulating properties of the vegetation and the tendency of bogs to
act as traps for the cold air that flows from adjacent uplands. It is

interesting to compare the distribution of the upland species White
Spruce (<i>Picea  glauca</i>) with that of Black Spruce., which is

well adapted to bogs. White Spruce ranges almost as far north as
Black Spruce. However, while the latter is common in bogs in northern

Pennsylvania, White Spruce occurs no farther south than northeastern
New York.</p>

<p>	Although wetlands are
not common in unglaciated parts of the Appalachians, various types

occur on the edges of flood plains, in association with springs and
in areas of flat-lying rock strata. Of special interest are those

which result from large artesian springs that well-up in underlying
fractured limestone. This type of wetland is rich in calcium and

magnesium and other nutrients and has low acidity. These conditions,
combined with a constant source of cool spring water, favor the

stable occurrence of a variety of rare species, including some far
south of their normal ranges. Thus the Folly Mills Calcareous Wetland

of Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, that was first identified by this
reporter, is home to one of the southernmost colonies of the

Arctic-ranging herb Buckbean  (<i>Menyanthes  trifoliata</i>),   the
State's only occurrence of the boreal Pussy Willow  (<i>Salix 

discolor</i>)  and a number of other rare plants. Buckbean also
occurs in acidic bogs, but does not thrive as well in them as it does

in calcareous wetlands. This illustrates an ecological principle,
namely, that the normal climatic range of a species, such as that the

cold-loving Buckbean, may be expanded by the increased availability
of nutrients or other favorable environmental factors.</p>

<p>	Although the specific
examples of ecological  relationships presented here are virtually

all from the Appalachians, conclusions drawn from them should be
applicable to forests in general. However, different forest types,

such as those of other mountain regions and the tropics in
particular, likely embody relationships not encountered in this

limited survey.</p>
