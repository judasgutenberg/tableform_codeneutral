<h1>Laurel Fork Wilderness Areas and Vicinity</h1>
<p><b>Randolph County, West Virginia</b><br>
<i>January, 2000, Updated November 2003</i>

<p>









<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>

<p> 

<p>The twin
federally-designated Laurel Fork South and Laurel Fork North
Wilderness areas are divided by Forest Road 423 and a campground. The
most direct access is via FR 14 from the south.
<p>	The area inventoried by
us within the Wilderness Areas is underlain by Devonian Hampshire
Formation, which consists of non-marine sandstones, siltstones and
shales, mostly red to brownish-gray in color  (Cardwell <i>et al</i>,
1968).  Structurally these rocks are part of an anticline, and of
some significance is the presence of the Mississippian Greenbrier
Limestone in the headwater region of Laurel Fork, which is a branch
of the Cheat River. The disposition of the various rock and floral
types in the Laurel Fork watershed provides an interesting contrast
with those in the watershed of Otter Greek  (see <a href=ottercreek.htm>our section on Otter
Creek</a>).
<p>	Our report on the Wilderness Areas
here is based almost entirely on our August, 1999 and September 2000
visits, that of 1993 being in the nature of a reconnaissance. 
<p>

<h2 >Laurel Fork South</h2>
<ul>
<p> 

<b>Source Walk: 8-7-93</b>
<p>	During the morning a
rapid traverse was made from the campground into the Laurel Fork
South Wilderness. Successively noted were evidence, in the form of
remnant berries, of Blue Cohosh  (<i>Caulophyllum  thalictroides</i>), also those of a tall orchid. likely a <i>Habenaria</i>,  possible
Hairy Disoprum   (<i>Disporum  lanuginosum</i>)  and, in a lowland,
next to a fen, numerous berry stalks of Wild Sarsaparilla  (<i>Aralia</i>
 <i>nudicaulis</i>).  The fen bore many tall herbs, including Boneset
 (<i>Eupatorium  perfoliatum</i>),  unidentified species of <i>Panicum</i>
grass,  the sedge <i>Carex  gynandra</i>, Spotted Jewelweed (
<i>Impatiens  capensis</i>),  Arrow - leaf  Tear - thumb  (<i>Polygonum
 sagittatum</i>).  Common Monkeyflower    (<i>Mimulus  ringens</i>), Grass - leaved Goldenrod  (<i>Euthamia  graminifolia</i>),  as
well as other goldenrods. This appeared to be an old Beaver  (<i>Castor
 canadensis</i>)  meadow. Farther on, in upland forest, there was
Indian Cucumber -root  (<i>Medeola  virginiana</i>),  Panicled
Hawkweed  (<i>Hieracium  paniculatum</i>),  Wood Betony  (<i>Pedicularis
 canadensis</i>),  and in lower spots abundant Skunk Cabbage (
<i>Symplocarpos  foetidus</i>).  White  Hellebore  (<i>Veratrum 
veride</i>),  Canada Hemlock  (<i>Tsuga  canadensis</i>),  Red Spruce
 (<i>Picea  rubens</i>)  and a little Great Rhododendron (
<i>Rhododendron  maximum </i>)..At the base of many of the Spruce,
unidentified liverworts were common, as was New York Fern (
<i>Thelypteris  noveboracensis</i>)   quite generally. These were
accompanied by several species of lycopods, among them Shining
Clubmoss  (<i>Lycopodium </i> <i>lucidulum</i>.).White Wood Sorrel (
<i>Oxalis  montana</i>)  appeared to be widespread and Canada
Mayflower   (<i>Maianthemum  canadense</i>)  occurred as well. Only a
very little Christmas Fern  (<i>Polystichum  acrostichoides</i>)  was
seen.
<p>	At one place, on the
bank of a small pond, in the open, there was a neat pile of perhaps
seven dead six inch long Creek Chubs  (<i>Semotilis </i>
<i>atromaculatus</i>),  likely the work of a Mink  (<i>Mustela  vison</i>). 

<p>	In places there were
many small Spruce, perhaps indicating a comeback by this species
under the common Yellow Birch  (<i>Betula</i>  <i>alleghaniensis</i>), Sugar Maple  (<i>Acer  saccharum  </i>) and Beech  (<i>Fagus 
grandifolia</i>).  Here also lichens appeared more abundant.
<p>	Then, at a small seep,
and in association with White Hellebore, there appeared the first of 
the rare Glade Spurge (<i> Euphorbia  purpurea</i>)  in the form of a
dozen meter - high clumps, the leaves of which were covered with a
white fungal bloom.  This was followed by an opening with a stand of
tall wild rye  (<i>Elymus</i>  sp)  of unidentified species. 

<p>	Additional species
noted on the return to camp included a clump of Hobblebush  (<i>Viburnum
 alnifolium</i>),  Ninebark   (<i>Physocarpus  opulifolius</i>)  in a
seep and American Chestnut  (<i>Castanea  dentata</i>)  sprouts. The
omnipresence of small amounts of Red Maple  (<i>Acer  rubrum</i>) 
was also noted.
<p>

<b>Source Walks: 8-23-99, 8-24-99 and 8-25-99</b>
<p>	The character of the terrain and
vegetation along FR 14 was observed in passing on the approach to
Laurel Fork. An impression was received of few rock exposures and a
highly mesic forest with a canopy consisting conspicuously of maples,
Beech and birch. Little or no Great Rhododendron was seen, a
characteristic also of the area inventoried by us at Laurel Fork.
<p>	Weather during our 1999 visit was mostly sunny
and pleasant, but quite dry as a consequence of a persistent
months-long drought. Consequently stream waters were at a very low
level.
<p>	Our 1999 inventories consisted of
two traverses up - valley from the campground and observations over
several days in the vicinity of camp. The traverse of 8-24-99 was
over the same general terrain as that of 8-23-99, although
concentrated on different parts of this terrain, and that of 8-24-99
extended farthest up - valley. In our attempt to obtain the most
comprehensive picture possible of this area, the courses of these
traverses repeatedly crossed the ecotone between the upland forest
and the flood plain and terraces associated with Laurel Fork.

<p>	Thunder sounded as we
began our traverse on the afternoon of 8-23-99 under cloudy skies.
Our course was along the trail that initially passed through the
ecotone between the flood plain and upland forest. The canopy here
consisted of Red and Sugar Maples, Beech, Yellow Birch,  small groves
of Canada Hemlock and scattered Red Spruce, White Ash  (<i>Fraxinus 
americana</i>)  and American Basswood  (<i>Tilia  americana</i>). 
Understory species noted were Muscletree  (<i>Carpinus  caroliniana </i>)
and Dotted Thorn  (<i>Crataegus  punctata </i>), the latter with
ripening fruit. Particularly abundant in wet areas was Speckled Alder
 (<i>Alnus  rugosa </i>) with stems up to six inches  (0. 15 m)  in
diameter, while in places Thornless Blackberry  (<i>Rubus  canadensis
</i>) formed thickets.
<p>	Flamboyant both in the
open and in shade was tall blooming Yellow Sneezeweed  (<i>Helenium 
autumnale </i>). But in many places Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago
 rugosa </i>) was the dominant herb. Other common tall herbs were
Grass-leaved Goldenrod,  Flat-top White Aster  (<i>Aster  umbellatus
</i>),  Fringed Loosestrife  (<i>Lysimachia  ciliata </i>).
Deer-tongue Grass  (<i>Panicum</i>  <i>clandestinum</i>)  and Tall
Meadowrue  (<i>Thalictrum  pubescens </i>). Japanese Beetles (<i>Popillia  japonica </i>) were common on various plants and in some
places Alder leaves were extensively perforated by them.
<p>	New York Fern appeared
to be common in many places,  including the rich soils of the flood
plain. Other plants successively tallied in open or semi-open areas
of the latter were Virgin's Bower  (<i>Clematis  virginiana</i>)  in
spectacular bloom, the sedge <i>Carex  intumescens</i>,  which is
usually considered acidiphile, Drooping Wood Reed Grass  (<i>Cinna 
latifolia</i>),  an acidiphile circumpolar grass, Fowl Manna Grass (<i>Glyceria  striata </i>), the manna grass <i>Glyceria  melicaria</i>,
 Mad-dog Skullcap  (<i>Scutellaria  lateriflora </i>),mostly gone to
seed, Skunk Cabbage, Sweet White Violet  (<i>Viola  blanda</i>), 
Northern Swamp Buttercup  (<i>Ranunculus  septentrionalis </i>),<i>
</i>the sedge <i>Carex  scabrata</i>, Sensitive Fern  (<i>Onoclea 
sensibilis</i>),  very dark green, large and vigorous Sweet-scented
Bedstraw  (<i>Galium  triflorum </i>), Golden Saxifrage (<i>Chrysosplenium  americanum</i>)  in wet spots, Crooked-stem Aster
 (<i>Aster  prenanthoides</i>),  Downy Wood Violet  (<i>Viola 
sororia</i>),  Golden Ragwort  (<i>Senecio  aureus </i>), Rough
Bedstraw  (<i>Galium  asprellum </i>), scattered Cinnamon  (<i>Osmunda
 cinnamomea</i>)  and Lady  (<i>Athyrium </i> <i>filix-femina</i>) 
Ferns, the sedges<i> Carex  baileyi</i>  and <i>Carex  gynandra </i>and
Riparian Wild Rye  (<i>Elymus  riparius </i>).
<p>	In places on the flood
plain as reached now, there were slightly elevated areas, usually
with Hemlock and/or Red Spruce, that, likely due to the effectiveness
of vertical acid leaching in such places, appeared more acidic than
the general flood plain. Here Canada Mayflower   and other acidiphile
herbs as well as <i>Sphagnum</i>  and <i>Leucobryum  </i>mosses
formed a ground cover. Also in such places, as well as the flood
plain edge, there were more fungi than on the flood plain proper.
Among these was <i>Amanita</i>  <i>flavoconia</i>.
<p>	With Belted Kingfishers
 (<i>Ceryle  alcyon </i>) calling from time to time, we continued up
- valley across the flood plain, noting in succession Foam Flower (<i>
Tiarella  cordifolia</i>),  Turtlehead  (<i>Chelone  glabra </i>),
Delicate Fern Moss  (<i>Thuidium  delictulum</i>),  the liverwort
<i>Scapania </i> <i>nemorosa</i>, Purple-stem Aster  (<i>Aster 
puniceus</i>),  Autumn Bent Grass  (<i>Agrostis  perennans</i>),  the
rush <i>Juncus  effusus</i>, the alien Velvet Grass (<i> Holcus 
lanatus</i>),  Black Elderberry  (<i>Sambucus  canadensis </i>) with
ripening fruit, abundant Arrow-leaf Tearthumb; then a few cries of a
startled Spring Peeper  (<i>Pseudacris </i> <i>crucifer</i>)  frog
close by. Next seen was Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel  (<i>Oxalis 
stricta </i>), Tall Agrimony (<i> Agrimonia  gryposepala </i>),
Spotted Jewelweed in bloom; then a species of <i>Polemonium</i> (likely <i>P. Reptans</i>),  the sedge <i>Carex  lurida</i>, Canada Brome Grass  (<i>Bromus  pubescens </i>), Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus </i> <i>uniflorus </i>), Rice Cutgrass  (<i>Leersia 
oryzoides </i>), the tall American Manna Grass  (<i>Glyceria  grandis</i>). Reed Canary Grass  (<i>Phalaris </i> <i>arundinacea</i>),  Common
Monkey Flower and White Hellebore. In one place, on Grass-leaved
Goldenrod, we saw a striking inch  (2,5 cm) -long caterpillar,
apparently hairless, with broad lateral bands of bright yellow and
thinner ones of red and blue.
<p>	We now moved up-slope into the upland forest, which had a   canopy dominated by Beech, Red
and Sugar Maples, and Black Cherry  (<i>Prunus  serotina</i>),   with
the last-named of rather poor form. At this point there was an
outcrop of cross-bedded sandstone, perhaps a remnant of an ancient
river bed. Herbs seen  were the sedge <i>Carex  laxiflora</i>, Curtis
Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago  curtisii</i>)  and,  on the trail, the alien
grass <i>Agrostis  giganteus</i>.  Small Beech were common, and only
a few showed possible signs of the Scale/<i>Nectria</i>  complex  (<i>Cryptococcus </i> <i>fagi / Nectria  coccinea</i>  var  <i>faginata</i>). As we continued we noted in succession the fungus <i>Stropharia 
hardii</i>, the sedge <i>Carex debilis</i>,  Carrion Flower  (<i>Smilax
 herbacea</i>),  Indian Cucumber-root, the fungus <i>Collybia 
dryophylla</i>, an abundance along the trail of the forest bluegrass
<i>Poa  alsodes</i>, a very little Plume Lily  (<i>Smilacina 
racemosa </i>) and considerable White Wood Sorrel. The soil in this
upland forest appeared to be a semi-mor, but was not sandy and
appeared clay-rich,  despite abundant fragments of sandstone, thus
indicting likely intercalated shale, mudstone etc in the rock. Also
occurring here were Ground Pine  (<i>Lycopodium  flabelliforme</i>), 
<i>Carex gracillima</i>, Stunted Common Greenbrier  (<i>Smilax 
rotundifolia </i>), <i>Cladina</i>  lichen, and Mountain Aster (<i>Aster  acuminatus</i>) .  Many rocks were covered with
unidentified species of <i>Hypnum  </i>moss and small saplings of Red
Spruce were common.
<p>	Still following the
trail through dominantly deciduous forest, we successively noted Pink
Ladyslipper  (<i>Cypripedium  acaule </i>), an unidentified <i>Habenaria</i>
 orchid, Painted Trillium  (<i>Trillium</i>  <i>undulatum </i>),
Canada Mayflower, Tree Clubmoss  (<i>Lycopodium</i>  <i>obscurum</i>), large seedlings of Red Spruce, Hay-scented Fern  (<i>Dennstaedtia 
punctilobula </i>), the fungi Green Stain (<i> Chlorociboria </i>
<i>aeruginascens </i>),  medicinal Birch Clinker  (<i>Inonotus 
obliquus </i>) and an unidentified <i>Russula</i>. These were
succeeded by a single American Basswood, more ill-appearing White
Ash, Beech Drops  (<i>Epifagus</i>  <i>virginiana</i>),  Variable
Panic Grass  (<i>Panicum  commutatum</i>) ; then,  perhaps indicating
a patch of more nutrient-rich soil, Bottlebrush Grass  (<i>Elymus 
hystrix</i>). 
<p>	Returning again to the
flood plain, a brief inventory was done of a Beaver  meadow.  Tallied
there were Hardhack  (<i>Spiraea  tomentosa </i>) in bloom, Water
Horehound  (<i>Lycopus  americanus </i>), Blue Vervain  (<i>Verbena 
hastata </i>) and Purple-leaved Willow-herb  (<i>Epilobium  coloratum
</i>), both in bloom, Dotted St. Johns-wort  (<i>Hypericum  punctatum</i>
),  Small-flowered St. Johns-wort  (<i>H.  mutilum</i>), 
Elliptic-leaf St. Johns-wort  (<i>H.  ellipticum</i>),  Climbing
False Buckwheat  (<i>Polygonum  scandens </i>), Rough Cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla  norvegica</i>),  the sedge <i>Scirpus  cyperinus</i>,
the rush <i>Juncus  subcaudatis</i>, the spikerush <i>Eleocharis
obtusa</i>, Larger Water Starwort  (<i>Callitriche  heterophylla</i>
), Small Burreed  (<i>Sparganium </i> <i>chlorocarpum</i>)  and
Floating Pondweed (<i> Potamogeton  epihydrous</i>).  Also present
was Indian Tobacco  (<i>Lobelia  inflata </i>), a species more
characteristic of dry habitats.
<p>	Our inventory of
8-24-99 began during the morning under almost clear skies with high
clouds and pleasant temperatures. Initiating our traverse was a spot
inventory of a low terrace/natural levee complex along the stream at
camp. The inventoried tract, perhaps 1/4 acre  (0.1 ha)  in area, had
a canopy of Red and Sugar Maples, Beech, Yellow Birch and Hemlock,
with Muscletree and Dotted Thorn in the understory. Witch Hazel (
<i>Hamamelis  virginiana </i>) was the only shrub seen, and Common
Greenbrier the only vine. Seedlings of Hemlock were common.
<p>	Herbs found in this
quite shaded habitat were blooming Yellow Sneezeweed, very abundant
<i>Brachyelytrum erectum  </i>grass, Hay-scented, New York and a
small amount of Cinnamon Ferns, Cut-leaf Grape Fern (<i> Botrychium 
dissectum </i>), Bottlebrush Grass, Foam Flower, Golden Ragwort,
American Pennywort  (<i>Hydrocotyle </i> <i>americana </i>), Blue
Monkshood  (<i>Aconitum  uncinatum</i>)  in bloom, Broad-leaf
Goldenrod (<i> Solidago  flexicaulis </i>), Tall White Lettuce (<i>Prenanthes  altissima </i>) with few flowers due to the shade,
Curtis Goldenrod, Tall Coneflower  (<i>Rudbeckia </i> <i>laciniata </i>),
Oswego Tea  (<i>Monarda  didyma</i>),  Canada Violet  (<i>Viola 
canadensis </i>), Filmy Angelica  (<i>Angelica  triquinata</i>), 
also in bloom, abundant Skunk Cabbage, Wood Nettle  (<i>Laportea</i> 
<i>canadensis</i>),  an unidentified <i>Habenaria  </i>orchid, Canada
Brome Grass, Autumn Bent Grass, and the sedge <i>Carex  vulpioidea</i>.
The most conspicuous mosses were <i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>, a
species of <i>Atrichum  </i>and Tree Moss  (<i>Climacium  americanum</i>). No strongly acidiphile mosses were seen. Fungi recorded were
<i>Collybia  dryophylla</i>, <i>Tyromyces  chioneus </i>, <i>Xerula 
furfuracea</i>  and an unidentified species of <i>Russula</i>.

8-24-99: Terrace Forest, Laurel Fork South Wilderness.
</font>
</center>
<p>



<p>	This terrace contained few
acidiphiles - Cinnamon Fern being an exception- and some species such
as Canada Violet, Bottlebrush Grass, Wood Nettle and Tree Moss are
generally found on nutrient-rich soils, although these may be
somewhat acidic. Their presence would thus seem to indicate that
nutrients deposited by the stream effectively counter acid leaching
on most of this low terrace.
<p>	As we again moved up -
valley, initially along a natural levee, we successively encountered
the fungus <i>Boletus  piperatus</i>, Field Basil  (<i>Satureja 
vulgaris </i>) and Northern Bugleweed. Then, crossing an open meadow,
we were attracted by a congregation of butterflies that included
Atlantic and Great Spangled Fritillaries  (<i>Speyeria  atlantis  </i>and
<i>S</i>.<i>  cybele</i>).  Not far beyond these we saw a single
clump of Millet Grass  (<i>Milium  effusum </i>), a circumpolar
species indicative of northern habitat as well as fertile soils  (see
our sections on <a href=blows.htm>Blowing Springs</a> and <a href=ramsey.htm>Ramsey's Draft</a> for  different
habitats of this grass). 
<p>	Although our attention
to plants limited our observations of birds, such conspicuous species
as White-breasted Nuthatch  (<i>Sitta</i>  <i>carolinensis</i>) 
attracted our attention in this area of scattered trees. Here  we
were impressed by the superior forms of the flood plain White Ash and
Black Cherry when compared to those in the upland forest and noted
the only Hophornbeam  (<i>Ostrya  virginiana</i>)  of our entire
survey. Also, on approaching the stream, we observed a mature Red
Spruce growing from a meter-high bank at its edge, a nearby one foot
 (0.3 m)  diameter White Ash and a little Cinnamon Fern. The
locations of the Spruce and the Fern posed interesting questions
regarding the variation of pH in the flood plain soils.
<p>	Returning briefly to
the upland forest, we found a wealth of fungi that included
<i>Trichaptum  biforme</i>, the poisonous puffball <i>Scleroderma 
citrinum</i>, <i>Polyporus  varius</i>,  the parasite of fungi and
brilliant red Lobster Mushroom  (<i>Hypomyces  lactifluorum </i>),
<i>Hypomyces  cantharellus</i>, the edible <i>Laccaria  ochropurpurea
 </i>and tiny <i>Rickenella  fibula</i>  growing from a bed of <i>Hypnum</i>
 and <i>Dicranum</i>  mosses.
<p>	Once more on the flood
plain and at the stream, we noted shallow water over a bed of small
cobbles, and attached to the latter, half-inch  (1.2 cm) 
spirally-coiled gastropods, but not in great numbers. Also present
were three-inch  (7.5 cm)  fish of unknown species  (but see our
following survey),  a Northern Leopard Frog  (<i>Rana  pipiens</i>) 
and a <i>Dolomedes   </i>fishing spider moving over the water
surface. Also of interest was the presence of a slimy coating on the
submerged rocks, perhaps from bacteria, diatoms or algae and
indicative of circumneutral to alkaline nutrient-rich waters. Wolf
spiders also seemed to be abundant here.
<p>	Our next discovery was
a Two-lined Salamander  (<i>Eurycea  bislineata</i>),  found by
turning over a cobble at the stream edge; then another large  (20
inch/0.5 m)  Red Spruce, again growing at the edge of a high stream
bank, perhaps favored there by more effective vertical acid leaching 

<p>	While the flood plain
vegetation was generally tall and dense, mud flats at the stream edge
provided habitat for smaller plants such as Pennsylvania Bittercress
 (<i>Cardamine  pensylvanica </i>), Clammy Hedge-hyssop  (<i>Gratiola
 neglecta</i>)  and Common Horsetail  (<i>Eqisetum  arvense </i>). 
Accompanying these plants was a reddish scum on the soil, perhaps a
sign of iron bacteria or other organisms.
<p>	Now resuming our
passage through tall vegetation, we were excited to encounter once
more the rare Appalachian endemic Glade Spurge  in bloom; then very
tall Swamp Thistle  (<i>Cirsium  muticum </i>), also in bloom, with
butterflies, including the Pipevine Swallowtail (<i> Papilio </i>
<i>philenor</i>)  as well as black female race of the Tiger
Swallowtail  (<i>P</i>.  <i>glaucus</i>)  in attendance on the
Thistle flowers.
<p>	As we moved farther up
- valley, we saw more Climbing False Buckwheat, a few plants of the
alien Common Burdock or &quot;Gobo&quot;  (<i>Arctium  minus</i>), 
very abundant New York Fern and a little Silvery Glade Fern (
<i>Athyrium  thelypterioides </i>). Also present was Red Maple
accompanied by a little Interrupted Fern  (<i>Osmunda </i>
<i>claytoniana</i>),  both indicators of some soil acidity on the
flood plain proper. However ample available nutrients were indicated
by Sugar Maple  (here bearing the moss <i>Ulota  crispa</i>), 
Christmas Fern  (<i>Polystichum  acrostichoides </i>) and especially
seed stalks of Ramp  (<i>Allium  tricoccum</i>)  and a single cane of
Black Raspberry  (<i>Rubus </i> <i>occidentalis</i>).  Although fungi
were not common on the rich flood plain soils, we did observe the
Scaly Vase Chantrelle  (<i>Gomphus </i> <i>floccosus </i>) as well as
unidentified species of <i>Mycena</i>  and <i>Clitocybe</i>.
<p>	We now arrived at
another local elevation, populated in this case by Hemlock, a number
of small Beech, Canada Mayflower, Partridge Berry  (<i>Mitchella 
repens </i>), Hairy Disporum and Christmas Fern. Then, at the nearby
stream, we discovered, under a rock, a crayfish with numerous young
attached ventrally, Also seen in the vicinity were Water Speedwell (<i>
Veronica</i>  <i>anagallis-aquatica</i>), American Brooklime  (<i>V. 
americana </i>) and more Indian Tobacco,  here, as at the Beaver
meadow, unexpected in this wet habitat.
<p>	Our course up-valley
now took us to a wooded bench or terrace several acres (~ one ha)  in
area.  Crossing this terrace in the up-valley direction, we noted in
succession the deadly fungus <i>Amanita  virosa</i>, Hairy Sweet
Cicely  (<i>Osmorhiza  claytoni</i>),  a 20 inch  (0.5 m)  dbh Red
Spruce with similar Spruce scattered about, the attractive and edible
fungus <i>Pluteus  flavofuligineus</i>, abundant Skunk Cabbage and
New York Fern, mature Hemlock, Wood Anemone  (<i>Anemone</i> 
<i>quinquefolia</i>),  Beech, Lady Fern, foot-high Spruce seedlings, 
the hybrid toothwort <i>Dentaria  maxima</i>  (or <i>Cardamine x 
maxima</i>)  and Canada Mayflower; then a Meadow Jumping Mouse (<i>
Zapus  hudsonius </i>), caught and eaten by our dog. These were
followed by Shining Clubmoss,  Downy Wood Violet, Sugar Maple,
Bottlebrush Grass, Blue Cohosh,  Canada Violet, more Bottlebrush
Grass, Barren Strawberry  (<i>Waldsteinia  fragarioides </i>), Black
Cherry, the forest debris fungus<i> Crepidotus  mollis</i>  and
Intermediate Shield Fern  (<i>Dryopteris  intermedia </i>) in one of
the few sightings of this fern by us in the Valley. As the forest
gave way to an opening we were treated to the sight of a Woodcock (<i>Scolopax  minor</i>)  that rose silently from concealment near us.

8-24-99: R. Hunsucker and D. Simkins and Swamp Thistle friend, Laurel Fork South Wilderness.
</font>
</center>
<p>
<p>	Although much of the flora of this
terrace is characteristic of nutrient-rich soils, some acidification
is indicated by such plants as Canada Mayflower and Shining Clubmoss.
<p>	The opening reached
here is an extension of the wooded terrace but with a less even
surface, and was probably once a pasture. Seen now was the first
haircap  (<i>Polytrichum</i>)  moss on a local elevation. Not far
up-valley we came to a large patch of the circumpolar Red Raspberry (
<i>Rubus  strigosus </i> or <i>R.  idaeus </i>) under a large Dotted
Thorn. The opening was populated largely by forbs previously
encountered on the flood plain, and was   punctuated by quite large,
seemingly very vigorous Red Spruce with dense foliage to the ground.
The immediate area around one of these trees exhibited distinct
acidification as shown by a community consisting of an unidentified
species of <i>Polytrichum</i>  and <i>Pleurozium  schreberi </i>
mosses, Common Clubmoss  (<i>Lycopodium  clavatum </i>), Tree
Clubmoss, Bracken Fern  (<i>Pteridium  aqilinum</i>),  Hay-scented
Fern, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod, the grass <i>Brachyelytrum  erectum 
</i>and Hairy Panic Grass  (<i>Panicum  lanuginosum</i> ).  The
Hay-scented Fern was home to a beautiful sky-blue leaf-hopper.
<p>	We now reached the
maximum up - valley distance of our traverse and began our return to
camp via the upland forest trail. First recorded along the trail was
the Ash Bolete  (<i>Gyrodon </i> <i>merulioides </i>) fungus under
White Ash of good form, then a concentration of <i>Carex  scabrata</i>
in a gully, followed by a single plant of the rich-soil indicator
<i>Carex  plantaginea</i>  in another gully.
<p>	We were next attracted
by a small bog formed at a seep, perhaps 50 feet  (15 m)  lower in
elevation than the trail. This bog was punctuated by several five
inch  (0.13 m)  dbh Yellow Birch and a number of small Red Spruce
saplings. Associated herbs were Cinnamon, Sensitive and Intermediate
Shield Ferns, the manna grass <i>Glyceria  melicaria</i>, Drooping
Wood Reed Grass, Autumn Bent Grass, Golden Ragwort, a jewelweed (
<i>Impatiens</i>  sp),  Canada Mayflower, Northern White Violet (
<i>Viola  pallens</i>),  Turtlehead, Skunk Cabbage, Mad-dog Skullcap,
Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod, the sedge <i>Carex  stipata </i>and Shining
Clubmoss. Mosses were represented by unidentified species of <i>Hypnum</i>
 and <i>Sphagnum  </i>and <i>Aulocomnium  palustre,  </i>and
liverworts by <i>Bazzania  trilobata</i>. Tiny seedlings of Hemlock (
but not Spruce)  were present in moss that covered large woody
debris.
<p>On
ascending the slope from the bog we noted Beech with large circular
patches of what appeared to be a brown crustose lichen. as well as
some trees that showed possible signs of the Scale/<i>Nectria</i> 
complex in the form of numerous cracks in the bark. Also seen were
the fungi <i>Pluteus  cervinus  </i>and <i>Lycoperdon  perlatum </i>.
On the trail once more, we saw a Clintonia, likely<i> C. borealis</i>,
Panicled Hawkweed  in full bloom, the fungus <i>Clitocybe</i> 
<i>clavipes</i>, Silverrod  (<i>Solidago  bicolor</i>),  also in
bloom, and a mature, multistemmed Black Birch  (<i>Betula  lenta</i>), the only member of this species seen by us in all our inventories
here.
<p>	Additional fungi
collected on this traverse and identified by R. Hunsucker were
<i>Phellinus  pini</i>  (the Pine Conk)  on a rare standing White
Pine, <i>Ganoderma  applanatum</i>, <i>G. tsugae</i>  on Hemlock and
<i>Schizophyllum  commune</i>. According to Phillips  (1991),  the
Pine Conk is one of the most destructive fungi of pine. Is it
possible that this fungus plays a role in limiting  the occurrence of
pines in the humid Alleghenies? 

<p>	A few additional vascular plants
that were not seen 1999, but were in 1993, are the following:
Ninebark and Boneset on the flood plain and in the upland forest a
very little Great Rhododenrdron, Hobblebush a few American Chestnut
sprouts, Wild Sarsaparilla and Wood Betony.

 <b>Observations at Camp</b>
 

<p>	Numerous faunal
observations were made in the vicinity of our camp. An extensive
display of bat activity occurred on the evening of 8-23-99, with
small bats swooping low over the stream beneath heavy foliage at
dusk, and later with apparently larger bats higher above the meadow.
Ravens  (<i>Corvus  corax  </i>) also  attracted our attention by
their aerobatics in obvious enjoyment of the strong wind blowing over
the ridges on the evening of 8-24-99, and their cries could be heard
throughout our stay. Of particular interest was the sighting on the
evening of 8-24-99 of a Sharpshinned Hawk  (<i>Acipiter  striatus </i>)
flying low over the trees and a possible glimpse of a Saw-whet Owl (
<i>Aegolius  acadicus </i>) in  dense cover. Also in dense cover, the
largest Woodchuck  (<i>Marmota  monax</i>)  any of us had ever seen, 
managed a stand-off with our dog.
<p>	Not long after our
arrival a silent but very active Yellow-billed Cuckoo  (<i>Coccyzus 
americanus </i>) in the crowns of some Red Maples caught our
attention. Other birds seen near or at our camp were Chipping Sparrow
 (<i>Spizella  passerina</i>),  who begged for food almost underfoot,
Common Flicker  (<i>Colaptes  auratus</i>),  frequently-appearing
White-breasted Nuthatch, Black-capped Chickadee  (<i>Parus</i> 
<i>atricapillus</i>),  Catbird  (<i>Dumetella  carolinensis </i>),
Wood Pewee  (<i>Contopus  virens </i>), numerous Goldfinch (
<i>Carduelis  tristis </i>), Bluebird  (<i>Sialia  sialis</i>), 
American Crow   (<i>Corvus  brachyrhynchos</i>).  Phoebe (<i>Sayornis
 phoebe </i>), Junco  (<i>Junco  hyemalis</i>),  Robin  (<i>Turdus </i>
<i>migratorius </i>), Blue Jay  (<i>Cyanocitta  cristata</i>), 
Screech owl  (<i>Otis  asio </i>) in evening and night, Song Sparrow
(<i> Melospiza  melodia</i>),  Scarlet Tanager  (<i>Piranga  olivacea
</i>), including the female, Blue Grossbeak  (<i>Guiraca  caerulea</i>), Indigo Bunting  (<i>Passerina  cyanea</i>),  White-eyed Vireo (
<i>Vireo  griseus </i>), Red-eyed Vireo  (<i>Vireo  olivaceus </i>)
and numerous warblers,including Black-throated Green  (<i>Dendroica</i>
 <i>virens</i>),  Yellow-rumped  (<i>D.  coronata </i>), Magnolia (
<i>D.  magnolia</i>),  Redstart  (<i>Setophaga  ruticilla </i>) and
Common Yellow-throat  (<i>Geothypis  trichas </i>).
<p>	Many small birds of different
species appeared to flock together, appearing at some location, then
another, some in the very tops of Spruce, darting out for insects on
the wing, chasing each other rapidly in seeming enjoyment, perhaps in
family groups, at the end of the breeding season, or exerting
dominance. While these small birds could be seen at all arboreal
levels, they were most abundant in the Alder thickets. There is where
we identified warblers at close range, particularly in the morning,
the Black-throated Green, Redstart, Yellow-rump, Magnolia and the
Common Yellow-throat who boldly exhibited himself in the open. Our
best observations of these warblers as well as the female Scarlet
Tanager and a number of other species were made in these Alder
thickets on the morning of 8-25-99 as rain threatened.
<p>	An effort was also made to assess
the fish in Laurel Fork. Identified by R. Hunsucker with the aid of a
fish trap were the following:
<p> 
<ul>
<br><i>Semotilus 
atromaculatus </i>  (Creek Chub) 
<br>	<i>Clinostomus 
funduloides</i>   (Rosyside Dace) 
<br>	<i>Rhinichthys 
atrotulus </i>  (Blacknose Dace) 
<br>	<i>Catostomus 
commersoni</i>   (White Sucker) 
</ul>
<p>

<b>Source Walks: 9-15-00 and 9-16-00	</b>
<p>                In the
mid - afternoon of 9 - 15 - 00 our party gathered at the Laurel Fork
campground under cloudy skies and cool temperatures. On the way in,
on FR 14, this reporter had encountered a half grown Black Bear (
<i>Ursus  americanus</i>)  in the middle of the road and saw it move
slowly up a gully. A flock of Wild Turkeys   (<i>Meleagris  gallopavo</i>) was also seen. Our first act was to determine the pH  (sample #1)of Laurel Fork, which proved to be 6.1. A determination  (sample #2) was made of the water from a springbrook immediately south of the
campground, which was found to be approximately 5.5. The value for
the Fork is compatible with the known calcareous source upstream.
<p>                A
traverse was then made up the Laurel Fork South Trail, along which,
just south of the campground, we noted a variety of mosses and fungi
under Red Spruce. These included  species of <i>Leucobryum</i> (
likely <i>L.  glaucum</i>),  <i>Dicranella </i>and <i>Hypnum</i>, the
fungi <i>Lactarius  lignyotus, Tylopilus  felleus, Lactarius
chrysorrheus</i> and an unidentified <i>Inocybe</i>. According to
Phillips  (1991),  most of these fungi are characteristic of acidic,
boreal habitats. Next seen were Muscletree,  Black Elderberry with
ripe fruit, abundant blooming Purple - stem Aster and Wrinkle - leaf
Goldenrod, large Witch Hazel and  <i>Polemonium  reptans</i> ; then
in the upland forest, the moss <i>Thuidium  delicatulum</i>, common
Sugar Maple seedlings and, on a large block of cross bedded
sandstone, abundant Drooping Wood Reed Grass, mosses and a single
seedling?sapling of White Ash. At this point it began to rain, and
continued in heavy showers, terminating our traverse.
<p>               After a
rainy night, Ravens  called and flew through the overcast. We then
continued our traverse along the Laurel Fork South Trail. Noted
successively were patches of Millet Grass, an unidentified species of
<i>Habenaria</i>, common foliage of Hooked Crowfoot  (<i>Ranunculus</i>
 <i>recurvatus</i>),  Indian Turnip  (<i>Arisaema  triphyllum</i>), 
seedlings of Hemlock, <i>Carex  intumescens</i>, six inch  (15 cm) 
tall Spruce seedlings, the fungus <i>Cystoderma</i>  (likely <i>C. 
granulosum </i>), Tree Clubmoss, <i>Carex  gracillescens</i> and the
moss <i>Pogonatum  pensilvanicum</i> with perennial protonema and few
leaves. Next seen were a few plants of <i>Carex  plantaginea </i>and
Bottlebrush grass in dark soil with. well - integrated organic
matter. A sample  (#3)  was taken from a 2 - 3 inch  (5 - 8 cm) 
depth near this <i>Carex</i> and a value of pH= 4.5 was obtained both
initially and 30 hours later.
<p>                 In
rather mature forest we encountered the lichens <i>Cladonia 
squamosa</i>, which made an imposing intergrowth with mosses and
<i>Cladonia  coniocraea</i> on decayed wood.
<p>                We now
heard a Red - shouldered Hawk  (<i>Buteo  lineatus</i> )  and,
continuing our traverse, we tallied the fungi <i>Crepidotus 
applanatus</i> and <i>Lepiota </i> <i>clypeolaria </i> (poisonous) ;
<i>Prenanthes  altissima</i>, Hairy Disporum in fruit, rare White Ash
with Ash Bolete  (Gyroporus  merulioides)  and Round - leaf Violet (
<i>Viola  rotundifolia</i>). 
<p>                 Here we
reached the edge of the flood plain, near an oxbow which bore
<i>Potamageton  epihydrus</i>. A soil sample  (#4)  was collected in
wet muck just above the waterline. Plants in the immediate vicinity
were Common   Clubmoss   (<i>Lycopodium clavatum</i>),  Ground Pine (
<i>Lycopodium  flabelliforme </i>), a haircap moss  (<i>Polytrichum</i>
 sp)  and spruce seedlings  (likely Red Spruce, although mature alien
Norway Spruce / <i>Picea</i>  <i>abies</i> were present nearby)  -
all under a mature Hemlock.  Sensitive Fern occurred in the nearby
water.
<p>pH of this soil sample was 4.3
initially and 4.4 thirty hours later.
<p>                On our
return through the upland forest we saw <i>Medeola</i>, and seeds of
Cucumbertree  (<i>Magnolia  acuminata</i>)  and basswood. Additional
fungi collected and identified by R. Hunsucker were as follows:
<p>

<br><i>Amanita  fulva</i>

<h2>Laurel Fork North</h2>
<p>
<ul>

<b>Source Walk: 8-6-93</b>
<p>            On a
reconnaissance traverse on the trail down - stream from the
campground it was noted that the forest appeared quite young with a
canopy dominated by Yellow Birch  (<i>Betula  alleghaniensis</i>), 
Sugar Maple  (<i>Acer  saccharum</i>)  and Beech  (<i>Fagus 
grandifolia</i>),  with much Black Cherry  (<i>Prunus  serotina</i>
), and less Canada Hemlock  (<i>Tsuga  canadensis</i>),  Red Maple (
<i>Acer  rubrum</i>)  and Red Spruce  (<i>Picea  rubens</i>).  There
were scattered White Ash  (<i>Fraxinus  americana</i>),  American 
Basswood  (<i>Tilia  americana</i>)  and a few large Cucumber
Magnolia  (<i>Magnolia  acuminata</i>).  Muscletree  (<i>Carpinus 
caroliniana</i>)  was a common species in the understory, as was 
Skunk Cabbage  (<i>Symplocarpus  foetidus</i>)  in moist areas. and
White Wood Sorrel <i> (Oxalis  montana</i>)  and Canada Mayflower (
<i>Maianthemum  canadense</i>)  in the forest ground flora. There was
also Hophornbeam  (<i>Ostrya  virginiana</i>),  serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier </i> sp),  Striped Maple  (<i>Acer  pensylvanicum</i>) and Mountain Maple  (<i>Acer  spicatum</i>),  and along the stream,
hawthorn  (<i>Crataegus </i> sp),  Speckled Alder  (<i>Alnus  rugosa</i>) and Witch Hazel  (<i>Hamamelis  virginiana</i>).  Along the
traverse we enjoyed dead ripe very large serviceberries, likely from
the Smooth species  (<i>A.  laevis</i>).   Also noted were Golden
Saxifrage  (<i>Chrysosplenium  americanum</i>),  Clearweed  (<i>Pilea
 pumila</i>),  White Snakeroot  (<i>Eupatorium  rugosum</i>), 
Spotted Jewelweed  (<i>Impatiens  capensis</i>),  Indian Turnip (
<i>Arisaema  triphyllum</i>),  Oswego Tea  (<i>Monarda  didyma</i>) 
in brilliant bloom, Flowering Raspberry  (<i>Rubus  odoratus</i>) 
and unidentified violets  (<i>Viola </i> sp).  Kingfishers  (Ceryle 
alcyon)  were common along the stream and Red Squirrels  (
<i>Tamiasciurus  hudsonicus</i>)  were noted. There were planted Red
Pine  (<i>Pinus  resinosa</i>)  at the campground, and no ericaceous
vegetation was seen along the traverse. This was among the most
characteristically mesic forests this reporter ever saw. Not one oak
was seen.
<p> 

<b>Source Walk: 8-8-93</b>
<p>	This is essentially a
survey of the forest along FR 14  in the edge of the Laurel Fork
North Wilderness. Elevation here is approximately 3600 feet  (1098 m). The forest on the wilderness side of the road had a rather open
canopy of mature Sugar Maple, Beech and Black Cherry, with scattered
White Ash, White Basswood  (<i>Tilia  heterophylla</i>),  Cucumber
Magnolia and Fraser Magnolia  (<i>Magnolia  fraseri</i>).  There was
much down wood, some large. The understory was largely Beech, with
abundant new York Fern  (<i>Thelypteris  noveboracensis</i>)  and
White Snakeroot. The soil visible on the upturned roots of fallen
trees appeared to be of the rich mull type, corresponding to the
presence of such species as White Basswood. Most Beech leaves
appeared to be curled up as if by severe draught, an improbable
possibility and more likely the result of a pathogen or an insect
attack. In the immediate vicinity of the road there was a robust
growth of Broad - leaf Waterleaf  (<i>Hydrophyllum  canadense</i>), 
perhaps as a consequence of nutrients derived from limestone road
gravel. 

<p>	On the west side of the road in non
- wilderness terrain, the forest appeared relatively degraded with
little down wood. No Spruce or Hemlock were observed in this forest
on either side of the road.
<p>

<b>Source Walk: 9-16-00</b>
<p>	
<p>	On the afternoon of 9-16-00, under bright blue sky with cumulus and cool temperatures, we
traversed down the Laurel Fork North Trail on a flood Plain terrace.
First noted was a near - perfect example of the parasitic fungus
<i>Boletus  parasiticus</i> on the poisonous puffball <i>Scleroderma 
citrinum</i>, Also noted in this perhaps thirty year old forest were
the numbers of healthy - appearing Beech  (<i>Fagus  grandifolia</i>), Beech sprouts, Yellow Birch and Sugar Maple, with less frequent
Black Cherry, Red Maple, Dotted Thorn  (<i>Crataegus  punctata </i>)
and Witch Hazel. In several places we observed small bars of road
gravel that had been swept from the road and deposited on the flood
plain during high water, with some possible impact on the character
of the flora. Next noted was a single plant of the beautiful Bottle
Gentian  (<i>Gentiana  andrewsii </i>): then the common occurrence of
Muscletree,  abundant New York Fern, Larger Water Starwort (
<i>Callitriche  heterophylla</i>)  in a pool, very common
<i>Brachyelytrum  erectum </i>grass<i></i>, abundant Skunk Cabbage
and scattered small saplings of Red Spruce. Noted next were Large
Roundleaf Orchid  (<i>Habenaria  orbiculata </i>), the common
occurrence of cushions of the moss <i>Leucobryum  glaucum,
</i>Intermediate Shield fern  (<i>Dryopteris  intermedia</i>),  the
moss <i>Thuidium  delicatulum</i> on the base of a Sugar Maple,
Canada Mayflower, Shining Clubmoss  (<i>Lycopodium  lucidulum </i>),
abundant sprouts of Beech and a sprinkling of Sugar Maple seedlings,
Partridge Berry  (<i>Mitchella  repens</i>),  the fungus <i>Rickenella
 fibula</i> in an unidentified <i>Hypnum</i> moss, the remains of
White Wood Sorrel and Sweet - scented Bedstraw  (<i>Galium  triflorum</i>),
<p>	We now reached a branch
stream, likely Tingler Run. Crossing this we noted <i>Carex 
plantaginea</i>, abundant New York Fern, Painted Trillium  (<i>Trillium
 undulatum</i>),  Golden Ragwort   (<i>Senecio  aureus</i>)  in
abundance, Red Maple, and Wrinkle - leaf Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago 
rugosa</i>). 
<p>	We now did a spot
inventory of a flat bar just above the water line. Recorded were
Riparian Wild Rye  (<i>Elymus  riparius</i>),  <i>Carex</i> 
<i>scabrata</i>, Deertongue Grass  (<i>Panicum  clandestinum</i>), 
Crooked - stem Aster  (<i>Aster  prenanthoides</i>),  Yellow
Sneezeweed   (<i>Helenium </i> a<i>utumnale </i>),  Sensitive Fern (
<i>Onoclea  sensibilis</i>),  Reed Canary Grass  (Phal<i>aris 
arundinacea </i>), Dotted Saint Johns Wort     (Hypericum  <i>punctatum
</i>), <i>Carex  torta </i>in the stream, Mad Dog Skullcap (
<i>Scutellaria  lateriflora</i>),  Rough Cinquefoil  (<i>Potentilla  
norvegica</i>),  Foamflower  (<i>Tiarella  cordifolia</i>),  Drooping
Wood Reed Grass  (<i>Cinna  latifolia</i>),  Silvery Glade Fern  (
<i>Athyrium  thelypterioides</i>),  a few of the alien Broadleaf Dock
  (<i>Rumex  obtusifoius</i>),  Northern Swamp Buttercup  (<i>Ranunculus
 sptentrionalis</i>),  Tall Meadowrue  (<i>Thalictrum  pubescens</i>), patches of the moss <i>Atrichum</i>  (likely <i>A.  undulatum</i>),the alien Ground Ivy  (<i>Glechoma  hederacea</i> ),   Golden
Saxifrage, White grass   (<i>Leersia  virginicum</i>),  White
Snakeroot in bloom, Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i> Oxalis  stricta</i>), Autumn Bent Grass  (<i>Agrostis  perennans</i>),  Purple - leaved
Willow - herb   (<i>Epilobium  coloratum</i>)  and Fowl Manna Grass (
<i>Glyceria </i> striata). 
<p>	A soil sample  (# 5) 
was taken from a 2 - 3 inch   (5 - 8 cm)  depth on the bare soil of a
recently deposited part of the bar. The soil appeared to be a rich
organic, sandy loam. This sample yielded a pH value of 5.5 initially
and one of 4.7 thirty hours later. It seems possible that in the
closed system of the sample, buffering by the sand may have occurred.
<p>	Our next observation
was of an unidentified one inch tan slug on an Oyster Mushroom (
<i>Pleurotus  ostreatus</i>)  Continuing down - valley,  we
successively noted a 10 inch  (25 cm)  dbh dead Butternut  (<i>Juglans
 cinerea</i>),  a straight, mature White Ash  (<i>Fraxinus  americana</i>), abundant Sugar Maple and Beech, more Canada Mayflower, well -
formed Black Cherry, the fungus &quot;Golden Spindles&quot; (<i>Clavaria  fusiformis</i>),  abundant New York Fern, the wood rush
<i>Luzula  acuminata</i> and Muscletree. 

<p>	Here we arrived at a
large branch stream, Five Lick Run, that was too large to cross. We
followed it down - stream toward Laurel Fork, encountering our first
Christmas Fern  (<i>Polystichum  acrostichoides</i>),  Blue Cohosh  (
<i>Caulophyllum  thalictroides</i>),  White  Hellebore (<i>Veratrum 
viride</i>),  the moss <i>Hylocomium  brevirostre</i> with an
unidentified <i>Atrichum </i>under Muscletree. Scattered Red Pine, either planted or self - seeded, were now observed, as was a
domestic apple tree  (<i>Pyrus   malus</i>),  with abundant fruit.
<p>	Now reaching a mature Red Spruce, a
soil sample  (# 6)  was taken from a 2 - 3 inch depth about 1/2 meter
from the trunk. Sample  pH values obtained were 4.5 initially and 4.6
thirty hours later.
<p>	Additional fungi collected and later
identified from this traverse by R. Hunsucker were as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<br><i>Armillariella  mellea</i>
 (Honey Mushroom)  - a parasite on many trees, edible, excellent 
<br><i>Baeospora  myasura)</i>
<br><i>Clitocybe  sp</i>
<br><i>Crepidotus 
applanatus</i> - on dead wood
<br><i>Cystoderma  granulosum (?)</i>
<br><i>Entoloma </i> spp
<br><i>Hygrophorus  borealis</i>
<br><i>Hygrophorus

<br><i>hygrophorus 
flavescens</i> - edible, in damp, mossy areas
<br><i>Hygrophorus 
marginatus</i>  var  <i>concolor</i>
<br><i>Hygrophorus  pritaccinus</i>
<br><i>Hypsizygus  tessulatus</i>
<br><i>Inonotus  obliquus </i>(
medicinal &quot;Birch Clinker&quot;)  - on dead wood or living trees
<br><i>Inonotus  radiatus</i>
<br><i>Laccaria  laccata</i>
<br><i>Lactarius  gerardii </i>-

<br><i>Paneolus  campanulatus</i>
<br><i>Peziza </i> sp
<br><i>Strobilomyces 
floccosus </i> (Old Man of the Woods),  edible
 </ul>

<p>	On the morning of 9 -
17 - 00 we were greeted by a heavy, white covering of frost, and
there was a visible increase in color of the leaves. Birds were
active in the Alders, including Magnolia and Yellow - rumped Warblers
  (<i>Dendroica  magnolia</i> and <i>D.  coronata</i> ),  Common
Yellowthroat  (<i>Geothlypis  trichas</i>).  Chipping Sparrow (
<i>Spizella  passerina</i>),  possible White - throated Sparrow  (
<i>Zonotrichia  albicollis</i> ),  Black - capped Chickadee   (<i>Parus
 atricappillus</i> )  and Red- shouldered Hawk  (<i>Buteo  lineatus
</i>). On returning to the Shenandoah Valley I found that there had
been no frost there.
 
</ul>
<h2>Beaver Dam Run</h2>
<ul>

<b >Source Walk: 8-7-93</b> 
<p>	This was a traverse
from the road along Beaver Dam Run to its confluence with Laurel
Fork. Immediately east of the road we noted Pipestem   (<i>Spiraea 
alba</i>),  Ninebark  (<i>Physocarpus  opulifolius</i>),  Grass -
leaved Goldenrod. Great Willow Herb   (<i>Epilobium </i>
<i>angustifolium</i>),   an unidentified willow herb, Glade St.
John's Wort   (<i>Hypericum  densiflorum</i>),  an elderberry (
likely <i>Sambucus  canadensis</i>),  Silky Willow  (<i>Salix 
sericea</i>)  and an unidentified bedstraw. The Spiraea and  St.
John's -  Wort were in spectacular bloom. The fen, which borders the
Beaver ponds along this stream, was surrounded by stands of Red
Spruce and Hemlock. and, at a distance, on dryer soil, planted Red
Pine. The calls of Catbirds  (<i>Dumetella  carolinensis</i>) 
further enlivened the scene. The traverse along Beaver Dam Run ranged
in elevation of near 3000 feet  (915 m)  at the road to perhaps 2800
feet  (844 m)  at Laurel Fork. Along the way we noted a little Pignut
Hickory  (<i>Carya  glabra</i> or <i>C.  ovalis</i>)  in a
predominantly Black Cherry, Beech, Sugar Maple forest, with abundant
small Red Spruce. Scattered Cucumber and Fraser Magnolia seedlings
were also observed and Red Maple was found throughout in small
numbers. Mountain Holly, Great Rhododendron and Striped Maple formed
understory and shrub layers. New York and other Ferns and White Wood
Sorrel, with some Canada Mayflower, appeared to dominate the ground
flora, while Golden Saxifrage was present in seeps. The calls of
Ovenbird  (<i>Seiurus  aurocapillus</i>)  and Wood Thrush (<i>Hylocichla  mustelina</i>)  were heard.
<p> 
 
<b>Source Walk: 8-8-93</b>
 
<p>A
reconnaissance traverse was done along the southeast edge of the
wetland west of the road, where we identified Choke Cherry  (<i>Prunus 
virginiana</i>),  Wild Raisin  (<i>Viburnum  cassinoides</i>),  Mountain
Holly  (<i>Ilex  montana</i>),  Winterberry  (<i>Ilex  verticillata</i>
), a little Mountain Laurel, much New York Fern, some Bracken Fern (
<i>Pteridium  aquilinum </i>) and planted Red Pine. A Red -
shouldered Hawk and scattered Japanese Beetles were noted as well.
There did not appear to be any Red Pine reproduction, although the
trees, here at 3000 feet  (915 m),  appeared healthy. Red Spruce,
which was concentrated near the wetland appeared to be reproducing
well, and Red Maple were common.  Also heard were Green Frogs  (<i>Rana
 clamitans</i> ),   and there were many amphibian eggs in the Beaver
ponds. A yellow beetle, about one cm in length, was very common, and
many Black Cherry trees were suffering from a leaf roller, and in
some cases entirely defoliated, so where this tree was abundant, the
hillsides were turned brown.

<h2>Sinks of Gandy</h2>
<ul>

<p>The Sinks of Gandy fall in a limestone
karst area developed in Greenbrier Limestone  (Cardwell <i>et al</i>,
1968 ).  Consequently it is characterized by sinkholes, caves and
underground streams. Although the Sinks lie in the same limestone
area that forms the headwaters of Laurel Fork, they are part of an
adjacent watershed to the east, namely that of Gandy Creek. The
combination of fertile calcareous soils and high elevation also
results in a diverse flora with some rare disjunct northern species. Among these is Twinflower  (<i>Linnaea  borealis</i>),  a species
found only at a few other locations in the Central Appalachians.
Another increasingly rare species in one of its last holdouts is
Canada Yew  (<i>Taxus  canadensis </i>). Unfortunately, the rich soil
has contributed to considerable, if unavoidable, degradation of the
area by agriculture and much of it has for a long time been
pastureland. However the owners  have been very generous in allowing
access to it. A desirable outcome would be acquisition or easement
protection by a public agency or private land trust and restoration
of the native vegetation.
<p>The following is a report on an
inventory of  bryophytes  (including, one lichen)  conducted by Dr.
Hunsucker at the Sinks of Gandy on 3 - 26 - 00. A review of the
liverworts was provided by Dr. Marie Hicks. See also Hicks  (1992). 
Species names are followed by the field observations of Dr. Hunsucker
and these by comments of Crum and Anderson  (1981)  as indicated by (

<h2>Summary</h2>
 <ul>

<p>	As recognized on our
August, 1993 visit, the forest in the area inventoried by us is among
the most characteristically mesic of any in the Central Appalachians
and compares in this with the forest at Shavers Fork  (see our
section on <a href=blisterer.htm>Blister Run/Shavers Fork</a>).  Not a single oak was recorded
and but few pines, of which most were either dead or, as in the case
of Red Pine planted. Neither hickories nor a number of other genra
characteristic of the Central Appalachians were seen in the
Wilderness areas. . The character of the forest here is also markedly
boreal for these elevations, with a very high Yellow to Black Birch
ratio  (only one Black Birch seen),  and a number cold-climate plants
such as Red Raspberry, Speckled Alder and Drooping Wood Reed Grass,
that seldom occur in the folded Appalachians to the east. Also, the
common occurrence of Red Spruce saplings in the understory hint that
this tree may once have been far more common than at present at these
elevations and is now staging a comeback.  Concomitantly missing in
the Wilderness are such mild climate species as Sycamore, Tuliptree,
Wingstem  (<i>Verbesina alternifolia</i>) and Thin-leaved Sunflower (<i>Helianthus  decapetalus </i>),  despite abundant otherwise suitable
habitat on the flood plain. Consequently,  although many rich- soil
indicators occur among herbs and shrubs, the vegetation is
climatically depauperate.  

<p>	More difficult to explain is the
virtual absence of ericaceae and Great Rhododendron in particular,
since the latter is a familiar of the cool, moist Alleghenies at all
elevations. Furthermore, the same environment that favors Great
Rhododendron is also hospitable to mosses and liverworts, An example
is Otter Creek  (see <a href=ottercreek.htm>our section on Otter Creek</a>).  By contrast, the
Laurel Fork Valley is not so obviously characterized by a rich flora
of bryophytes.
<p>	These and other differences between
Laurel fork and Otter Creek may be a consequence of the contrasting
geology of the two areas. Limestone and associated alkaline waters
and soils are confined to the vicinity of the lowest reaches of Otter
Creek, while the largest part of the watershed is dominated by
siliceous  rocks of the Pottsville Formation or equivalents- so much
so indeed that in recent years limestone has been artificially added
at a headwater facility to improve trout fishing. However limestone
at Laurel Fork lies at the headwaters, where it can exert its
influence on the entire mainstem and associated flood plain
downstream. This is also indicated by the measured pH of 6.1 of
Laurel Fork, as well as the initial similar value of bar sediment in
Laurel Fork North. Additionally, the rocks of the Hampshire
Formation, which dominate much of the middle and lower Laurel Fork
watershed, do not include  massive sandstones like the Pottsville and
its equivalents. Conspicuous expressions of these differences are the
prevalence in the Otter Creek Valley of coarse, even bouldery
alluvium and colluvium, while that of Laurel Fork is comprised of
small to moderate sized cobbles, sand and silt that have given rise
to broad flood plains and terraces. Thus it is likely that geology
plays an important if not dominant role in the floristics of the two
watersheds.
