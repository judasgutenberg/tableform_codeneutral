Structurally these rocks are part of an anticline,and of some significance is the presence of the Mississippian GreenbrierLimestone in the headwater region of Laurel Fork, which is a branch of theCheat River. The disposition of the various rock and floral types in the LaurelFork watershed provides an interesting contrast with those in the watershed ofOtter Greek ( see our section on Otter Creek ).<p> Our report here is based almost entirely on ourAugust, 1999 visit with only briefreferences to that of 1993.<p> The character of the terrain and vegetation along FR14 was observed in passing on the approach to Laurel Fork. An impression wasreceived of few rock exposures and a highly mesic forest with a canopyconsisting conspicuously of maples, Beech and birch. Little or no GreatRhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) was seen, a characteristicalso of the area inventoried by us at Laurel Fork.<p> Weather during our 1999 visit was mostly sunny andpleasant, but quite dry as a consequence of a persistent months-long drought.Consequently stream waters were at a very low level.<p> Our 1999 inventories consisted of two traversesupvalley from the campground and observations over several days in the vicinityof camp. The traverse of 8-24-99 was over the same general terrain as that of8-23-99, although concentrated on different parts of this terrain, and that of8-24-99 extended farthest upvalley. In our attempt to obtain the mostcomprehensive picture possible of this area the courses of these traverses repeatedlycrossed the ecotone between the upland forest and the flood plain and terracesassociated with Laurel Fork.<p><center><font size=-1 color=666666><img src="lfswlaurelfork.jpg" width=350 height=503 border="0"><br>8-24-99: Laurel Fork, Laurel Fork South Wilderness.<p><img src="lfswilderness.jpg" width=300 height=449 border="0"><br>8-24-99: Laurel Fork South Wilderness.<br></font></center><p><p> Thunder sounded as we began our traverse on theafternoon of 8-23-99 under cloudy skies. Our course was along the trail thatinitially passed through the ecotone between the flood plain and upland forest.The canopy here consisted of Red and Sugar Maples, Beech, Yellow Birch, smallgroves of Canada Hemlock and scattered Red Spruce, White Ash and AmericanBasswood. Understory species noted were Muscletree (<i>Carpinus caroliniana</i>) andDotted Thorn (<i>Crataegus punctata</i>),  the latter with ripeningfruit. Particularly abundant in wet areas was Speckled Alder (<i>Alnus rugosa</i>) with stems up to six inches ( 0. 15 m ) in diameter, whilein places Thornless Blackberry (<i>Rubus canadensis</i>) formed thickets.<p> Flamboyant both in the open and in shade was tallblooming Yellow Sneezeweed (<i>Helenium autumnale</i>).  But in many placesWrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa</i>) was the dominant herb. Othercommon tall herbs were Grass-leaved Goldenrod (<i>Euthamia graminifolia</i>),  Flat-top White Aster (<i>Aster umbellatus</i>),  Fringed Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia ciliata</i>). Deer-tongue Grass (<i>Panicum</i> <i>clandestinum</i>) and Tall Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum pubescens</i>).  Japanese Beetles (<i>Popillia japonica</i>) were common on various plants and in some places Alderleaves were extensively perforated by them.<p> New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis</i>) appeared to be commonin many places,  including the rich soils of the flood plain. Other plantssuccessively tallied in open or semi-open areas of the latter were Virgin'sBower (<i>Clematis virginiana</i>) in spectacular bloom, thesedge <i>Carex intumescens</i>,  which is usually considered acidiphile, <p>Drooping Wood Reed Grass (<i>Cinna latifolia</i>),  an acidiphile circumpolar grass, Fowl Manna Grass (<i>Glyceria striata</i>),  the manna grass <i>Glyceria melicaria</i>, Mad-dog Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria lateriflora</i>), mostly gone to seed, SkunkCabbage (<i>Symplocarpus foetidus</i>),  Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola blanda</i>),  Northern Swamp Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus septentrionalis</i>), <i></i>the sedge <i>Carex scabrata</i>, SensitiveFern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>),  very dark green, large and vigorousSweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>),  Golden Saxifrage (<i>Chrysosplenium americanum</i>) in wet spots, Crooked-stem Aster (<i>Aster prenanthoides</i>),  Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>),  GoldenRagwort (<i>Senecio aureus</i>),  Rough Bedstraw (<i>Galium asprellum</i>),  scattered Cinnamon (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>) andLady (<i>Athyrium filix-femina</i>) Ferns, the sedges<i>Carex baileyi</i> and <i>Carex gynandra </i>and Riparian Wild Rye (<i>Elymus riparius</i>). <p> In places on the flood plain as reached now, therewere slightly elevated areas, usually with Hemlock and/or Red Spruce, that,likely due to the effectiveness of vertical acid leaching in such places,appeared more acidic than the general flood plain. Here Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>) and other acidiphile herbs as well as <i>Sphagnum</i> and <i>Leucobryum </i>mosses formed a ground cover. Also insuch places, as well as the flood plain edge, there were more fungi than on theflood plain proper. Among these was <i>Amanita</i> <i>flavoconia</i>.<p> With Belted Kingfishers (<i>Ceryle alcyon</i>) callingfrom time to time, we continued upvalley across the flood plain, noting insuccession Foam Flower (<i>Tiarella cordifolia</i>),  Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>),  Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delictulum</i>),  the liverwort <i>Scapania nemorosa</i>, Purple-stemAster (<i>Aster puniceus</i>),  Autumn Bent Grass (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>),  therush <i>Juncus effusus</i>, the alien Velvet Grass (<i>Holcus lanatus</i>),  BlackElderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>) with ripening fruit,abundant Arrow-leaf Tearthumb (<i>Polgonum</i> <i>sagittatum</i>); then a few cries of a startled Spring Peeper (<i>Pseudacris crucifer</i>) frog close by. Next seen wasUpright Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis stricta</i>),  Tall Agrimony (<i>Agrimonia gryposepala</i>),  Spotted Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens capensis</i>) inbloom; then a species of <i>Polemonium</i> (likely <i>P. Reptans</i>),  the sedge <i>Carex lurida</i>, Canada Brome Grass (<i>Bromus pubescens</i>),  Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus</i>),  RiceCutgrass (<i>Leersia oryzoides</i>),  the tall American MannaGrass (<i>Glyceria grandis</i>).  Reed Canary Grass (<i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>),  CommonMonkey Flower (<i>Mimulus ringens</i>) and White Hellebore (<i>Veratrum viride</i>).  In one place, on Grass-leaved Goldenrod, we saw a strikinginch-long ( 2.5 cm ) caterpillar, apparently hairless, with broad lateral bandsof bright yellow and thinner ones of red and blue.<p> We now moved up-slope into the upland forest, whichhad a canopy dominated by Beech, Redand Sugar Maples, and Black Cherry,  with the last-named of rather poor form.At this point there was an outcrop of cross-bedded sandstone, perhaps a remnantof an ancient river bed. Herbs seen werethe sedge <i>Carex laxiflora</i>, Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii</i>) and, on the trail, the alien grass <i>Agrostis giganteus</i>.  Small Beech were common, andonly a few showed possible signs of the Scale/<i>Nectria</i> complex. As wecontinued we noted in succession the fungus <i>Stropharia hardii</i>, the sedge <i>Carex debilis</i>, CarrionFlower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>),  Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana</i>),  thefungus <i>Collybia dryophylla</i>, an abundance along the trail of the forestbluegrass <i>Poa alsodes</i>, a very little Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>) andconsiderable White Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis montana</i>).  The soil in this uplandforest appeared to be a semi-mor, but was not sandy and appeared clay-rich, despite abundant fragments of sandstone, thus indicting likely intercalatedshale, mudstone etc. Also occurring here were Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>),  <i>Carexgracillima</i>, Stunted Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>),  <i>Cladina</i> lichen, andMountain Aster (<i>Aster acuminatus</i>).  Many rocks were coveredwith unidentified species of <i>Hypnum </i>moss and small saplings of Red Sprucewere common.<p> Still following the trail through dominantlydeciduous forest, we successively noted Pink Ladyslipper (<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>),  anunidentified <i>Habenaria</i> orchid, Painted Trillium (<i>Trillium</i> <i>undulatum</i>),  CanadaMayflower, Tree Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium</i> <i>obscurum</i>), large seedlings of Red Spruce, Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>), the fungi Green Stain (<i>Chlorociboria aeruginascens</i>), medicinal Birch Clinker (<i>Inonotus obliquus</i>) and an unidentified <i>Russula</i>.These were succeeded by a single American Basswood, more ill-appearing WhiteAsh, Beech Drops (<i>Epifagus</i> <i>virginiana</i>), Variable Panic Grass (<i>Panicum commutatum</i>) ; then,  perhaps indicatinga patch of more nutrient-rich soil, Bottlebrush Grass (<i>Elymus hystrix</i>). <p> Returning again to the flood plain, a brief inventorywas done of a Beaver (<i>Castor canadensis</i>) meadow.  Tallied there wereHardhack (<i>Spiraea tomentosa</i>) in bloom, Water Horehound (<i>Lycopus americanus</i>),  Blue Vervain (<i>Verbena hastata</i>) and Purple-leaved Willow-herb(<i>Epilobium coloratum</i>),  both in bloom, Dotted St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum punctatum</i>),  Small-flowered St. Johns-wort (<i>H. mutilum</i>),  Elliptic-leafSt. Johns-wort (<i>H. ellipticum</i>),  Climbing False Buckwheat (<i>Polygonum scandens</i>),  Rough Cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla norvegica</i>),  thesedge <i>Scirpus cyperinus</i>, the rush <i>Juncus subcaudatis </i>and the aquatics <i>Eleocharisobtusa</i>, Larger Water Starwort (<i>Callitriche heterophylla</i>),  Small Burreed (<i>Sparganium chlorocarpum</i>) andFloating Pondweed (<i>Potamogeton epihydrous</i>).  Also present was IndianTobacco (<i>Lobelia inflata</i>),  a species more characteristicof dry habitats.<p> Our inventory of 8-24-99 began during the morningunder almost clear skies with high clouds and pleasant temperatures. Initiatingour traverse was a spot inventory of a low terrace/ natural levee complex alongthe stream at camp. The inventoried tract, perhaps 1/4 acre ( 0.08 ha ) inarea, had a canopy of Red and Sugar Maples, Beech, Yellow Birch and Hemlock,with Muscletree and Dotted Thorn in the understory. Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i>) was the only shrub seen, and Common Greenbrier the onlyvine. Seedlings of Hemlock were common.<p> Herbs found in this quite shaded habitat wereblooming Yellow Sneezeweed, very abundant <i>Brachyelytrumerectum </i>grass, Hay-scented,New Yorkand a small amount of Cinnamon Ferns, Cut-leaf Grape Fern (<i>Botrychium dissectum</i>), Bottlebrush Grass, Foam Flower, Golden Ragwort, American Pennywort (<i>Hydrocotyl americana</i>),  BlueMonkshood (<i>Aconitum uncinatum</i>) in bloom, Broad-leafGoldenrod (<i>Solidago flexicaulis</i>),  Tall White Lettuce (<i>Prenanthes altissima</i>) with few flowers due to the shade, Curtis Goldenrod,Tall Coneflower (<i>Rudbeckia laciniata</i>), Oswego Tea (<i>Monarda didyma</i>),  Canada Violet (<i>Viola canadensis</i>),  Filmy Angelica (<i>Angelica triquinata</i>),  also in bloom, abundantSkunk Cabbage, Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea</i> <i>canadensis</i>), an unidentified <i>Habenaria </i>orchid, Canada Brome Grass, Autumn BentGrass, and the sedge <i>Carex vulpioidea</i>. The most conspicuous mosseswere <i>Thuidium delictulum</i>, a speciesof <i>Atrichum </i>and Tree Moss (<i>Climacium americanum</i>).  No strongly acidiphilemosses were seen. Fungi recorded were <i>Collybia dryophylla</i>, <i>Tyromyces chioneus </i>, <i>Xerula furfuracea</i> and anunidentified species of <i>Russula</i>.<p><center><font size=-1 color=666666><img src="lfsforest.jpg" width=350 height=518 border="0"><br>8-24-99: Terrace Forest, Laurel Fork South Wilderness.</font></center><p><p> This terrace contained few acidiphiles - CinnamonFern being an exception- and some species such as Canada Violet, BottlebrushGrass, Wood Nettle and Tree Moss are generally found on nutrient-rich soils,although these may be somewhat acidic. Their presence would thus seem toindicate that nutrients deposited by the stream effectively counter acidleaching on most of this low terrace.<p> As we again moved upvalley, initially along a naturallevee, we successively encountered the fungus <i>Boletus piperatus</i>, FieldBasil (<i>Satureja vulgaris</i>) and Northern Bugleweed. Then,crossing an open meadow, we were attracted by a congregation of butterfliesthat included Atlantic and Great Spangled Fritillaries (<i>Speyeria atlantis </i>and <i>S</i>.<i> cybele</i>).  Not far beyond these we saw a single clump of Millet Grass(<i>Milium effusum</i>),  a circumpolar species indicative of northern habitat aswell as fertile soils ( see our section on Blowing Springs for a differenthabitat of this grass ).<p> Although our attention to plants limited ourobservations of birds, such conspicuous species as White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>Sitta</i> <i>carolinensis</i>) attracted ourattention in this area of scattered trees. Here we were impressed by the superior forms of the flood plain WhiteAsh and Black Cherry when compared to those in the upland forest and noted theonly Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya virginiana</i>) of our entire survey. Also,on approaching the stream, we observed a mature Red Spruce growing from ameter-high bank at its edge, a nearby one foot ( 0.3 m ) diameter White Ash anda little Cinnamon Fern. The locations of the Spruce and the Fern posedinteresting questions regarding the variation of pH in the flood plain soils.<p> Returning briefly to the upland forest, we found awealth of fungi that included <i>Trichaptum biforme</i>, the poisonous puffball <i>Scleroderma citrinum</i>, <i>Polyporus varius</i>,  the parasite of fungi andbrilliant red Lobster Mushroom (<i>Hypomyces lactifluorum</i>),  <i>Hypomyces cantharellus</i>, theedible <i>Laccaria ochropurpurea </i>andtiny <i>Rickenella fibula</i> growing from abed of <i>Hypnum</i> and <i>Dicranum</i> mosses.<p> Once more on the flood plain and at the stream, wenoted shallow water over a bed of small cobbles, and attached to the latter,half-inch( 1.2 cm ) spirally-coiled gastropods, but not in great numbers. Alsopresent were three-inch ( 7.5 cm ) fish of unknown species ( but see ourfollowing survey ), a Northern Leopard Frog (<i>Rana pipiens</i>) and a <i>Dolomedes </i>fishing spider moving over the water surface. Also of interest wasthe presence of a slimy coating on the submerged rocks, perhaps from bacteria,diatoms or algae and indicative of circumneutral to alkaline nutrient-richwaters. Wolf spiders also seemed to be abundant here.<p> We now refer back to our 8-7-93 visit on which, atsome point along this stream, we came upon a curious sight, namely a neat pileof seven dead six-inch ( 15 cm ) Creek Chubs (<i>Somotilus</i> <i>atromaculatus</i>) on the bank. From pastexperience we inferred this to be the work of a Mink (<i>Mustela vison</i>). <p> Returning to our 8-24-99 inventory, our nextdiscovery was a Two-lined Salamander (<i>Eurycea bislineata</i>),  found by turning over acobble at the stream edge; then another large ( 20 inch/0.5 m ) Red Spruce,again growing at the edge of a high stream bank, perhaps favored there by moreeffective vertical acid leaching <p> While the flood plain vegetation was generally talland dense, mud flats at the stream edge provided habitat for smaller plantssuch as Pennsylvania Bittercress (<i>Cardamine pensylvanica</i>),  Clammy Hedge-hyssop (<i>Gratiola neglecta</i>) and Common Horsetail (<i>Eqisetum arvense</i>).  Accompaning these plants was a reddish scumon the soil, perhaps a sign of iron bacteria or other organisms.<p> Now resuming our passage through tall vegetation, wewere excited to encounter the rare Appalachian endemic Glade Spurge (<i>Euphorbia purpurea</i>) in bloom; then very tall Swamp Thistle (<i>Cirsium muticum</i>),  also in bloom, with butterflies, including the PipevineSwallowtail (<i>Papilio philenor</i>) as well as black female race of the Tiger Swallowtail (<i>P.</i> <i>glaucus</i>) in attendance on the Thistle flowers.<p> As we moved farther upvalley, we saw more ClimbingFalse Buckwheat, a few plants of the alien Common Burdock or &quot;Gobo&quot; (<i>Arctium minus</i>), very abundant New york Fern and a little Silvery Glade Fern(<i>Athyrium thelypterioides</i>).  Also present was Red Maple accompanied bya little Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda claytoniana</i>), both indicators of some soil acidity on the flood plain proper. Howeverample available nutrients were indicated by Sugar Maple ( here bearing the moss<i>Ulota crispa</i>), Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>) and especially seedstalks of Ramp (<i>Allium tricoccum</i>) and a single cane of Black Raspberry(<i>Rubus occidentalis</i>).  Althoughfungi were not common on the rich flood plain soils, we did observe the ScalyVase Chantrelle (<i>Gomphus floccosus</i>) as well as unidentified species of <i>Mycena</i> and <i>Clitocybe</i>.<p> We now arrived at another local elevation,populatedin this case by Hemlock, a number of small Beech, Canada Mayflower, PartridgeBerry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>),  Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum</i> <i>lanuginosum</i>) andChristmas Fern.Then at the nearby stream we discovered, under a rock, acrayfish with numerous young attached ventrally, Also seen in the vicinity wereWater Speedwell (<i>Veronica</i> <i>anagallis-aquatica</i>),American Brooklime (<i>V. americana</i>) and more Indian Tobacco, here as at the Beaver meadow, unexpected in this wet habitat.<p> Our course up-valley now took us to a wooded bench orterrace several acres (~ one ha ) in area.  Crossing this terrace in theup-valley direction, we noted in succession the deadly fungus <i>Amanita virosa</i>, Hairy Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza claytoni</i>),  a 20 inch ( 0.5 m ) dbh RedSpruce with similar Spruce scattered about, the attractive and edible fungus <i>Pluteus flavofuligineus</i>, abundant Skunk Cabbage and New York Fern, matureHemlock, Wood Anemone (<i>Anemone</i> <i>quinquefolia</i>), Beech, Lady Fern, foot-high Spruce seedlings, the hybrid toothwort <i>Dentaria maxima</i> ( or <i>Cardamine x maxima</i>) andCanada Mayflower; then a Meadow Jumping Mouse (<i>Zapus hudsonius</i>),  caughtand eaten by our dog. These were followed by Shining Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium lucidulum</i>),  Downy Wood Violet, Sugar Maple, Bottlebrush Grass, BlueCohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i>), Canada Violet, more Bottlebrush Grass, Barren Strawberry (<i>Waldsteinia fragarioides</i>),  Black Cherry, the forest debris fungus<i>Crepidotus mollis</i> and IntermediateShield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>) in one of the few sightingsof this fern by us in the Valley. As the forest gave way to an opening we weretreated to the sight of a Woodcock (<i>Scolopax minor</i>) that rose silently fromconcealment near us.<p><center><img src="swampthistle.jpg" width=350 height=486 border="0"><br><font size=-1 color=666666>8-24-99: R. Hunsucker and D. Simkins and Swamp Thistle friend, Laurel Fork South Wilderness.</font></center><p><p> Although much of the flora of this terrace ischaracteristic of nutrient-rich soils, some acidification is indicated by suchplants as Canada Mayflower and Shining Clubmoss.<p> The opening reached here is an extension of thewooded terrace but with a less even surface, and was probably once a pasture.Seen now was the first haircap (<i>Polytrichum</i>) moss on a local elevation. Not far up-valley we came to a large patch of thecircumpolar Red Raspberry (<i>Rubus strigosus </i> or <i>R. idaeus</i>) under a large Dotted Thorn. Theopening was populated largely by forbs previously encountered on the floodplain, and was punctuated by quitelarge, seemingly very vigorous Red Spruce with dense foliage to the ground. Theimmediate area around one of these trees exhibited distinct acidification asshown by a community consisting of an unidentified species of <i>Polytrichum</i> and <i>Pleurozium schreberi </i> mosses, Common Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium clavatum</i>),  Tree Clubmoss, Bracken Fern(<i>Pteridium aqilinum</i>),  Hay-scented Fern, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod, thegrass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum </i>and Hairy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum lanuginosum</i> ). The Hay-scented Fern was home to a beautiful sky-blueleaf-hopper.<p> We now reached the maximum upvalley distance of ourtraverse and began our return to camp via the upland forest trail. First recordedalong the trail was the Ash Bolete (<i>Gyrodon merulioides</i>) fungus under White Ash of good form, then a concentration of <i>Carex scabrata</i> in a gully, followed by a single plant of the rich-soilindicator <i>Carex plantaginea</i> inanother gully.<p> We were next attracted by a small bog formed at aseep,perhaps 50 feet ( 15 m ) lower in elevation than the trail. This bog waspunctuated by several five inch ( 0.13 m ) dbh Yellow Birch and a number ofsmall Red Spruce saplings. Associated herbs were Cinnamon, Sensitive andIntermediate Shield Ferns, the manna grass <i>Glyceria melicaria</i>, Drooping Wood Reed Grass,Autumn Bent Grass, Golden Ragwort, a jewelweed (<i>Impatiens</i> sp ), CanadaMayflower, Northern White Violet (<i>Viola pallens</i>),  Turtlehead, Skunk Cabbage,Mad-dog Skullcap, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod, the sedge <i>Carex stipata </i>and ShiningClubmoss. Mosses were represented by unidentified species of <i>Hypnum</i> and <i>Sphagnum </i>and <i>Aulocomnium palustre,  </i>and liverworts by <i>Bazzania trilobata</i>. Tiny seedlings of Hemlock ( but not Spruce ) were presentin moss that covered large woody debris.<p>On ascending the slope fromthe bog we noted Beech with large circular patches of what appeared to be abrown crustose lichen. as well as some trees that showed possible signs of theScale/<i>Nectria</i> complex in the form of numerous cracks inthe bark. Also seen were the fungi <i>Pluteus cervinus </i>and <i>Lycoperdon perlatum </i>. On the trail once more, wesaw a Clintonia, likely<i>C. borealis,</i>Panicled Hawkweed (<i>Hieracium paniculatum</i>) in full bloom, the fungus <i>Clitocybe</i> <i>clavipes</i>, Silverrod (<i>Solidago bicolor</i>),  also in bloom, and a mature, multistemmed Black Birch,the only member of this species seen by us in all our inventories here.<p> Additional fungi collected on this traverse andidentified by R. Hunsucker were <i>Phellinus pini</i> ( the Pine Conk ) on a rarestanding White Pine, <i>Ganoderma applanatum</i>, <i>G. tsugae</i> on Hemlock and <i>Schizophyllum commune</i>. According to Phillips ( 1991 ), the Pine Conk is oneof the most destructive fungi of pine. Is it possible that this fungus plays arole in limiting the occurrence ofpines in the humid Alleghenies? <p> A few additional vascular plants that were not seen1999, but were in 1993, are the following: Ninebark ( <i>Physocarpus opulifolius </i> ) and Boneset (<i>Eupatorium perfoliatum</i>) on the flood plain and in the upland forest a verylittle Great Rhododenrdron, Hobblebush (<i>Viburnum alnifolium</i>),  a few American Chestnut (<i>Castaea dentata</i>) sprouts, Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>) andWood Betony (<i>Pedicularis canadensis</i>).  <p>&nbsp;</ul><p><b>Observations at Camp</b><ul><p> <p> Numerous faunal observations were made in thevicinity of our camp. An extensive display of bat activity occurred on theevening of 8-23-99, with small bats swooping low over the stream beneath heavyfoliage at dusk, and later with apparently larger bats higher above the meadow.Ravens (<i>Corvus corax </i>) also attracted our attention by their aerobaticsin obvious enjoyment of the strong wind blowing over the ridges on the eveningof 8-24-99, and their cries could be heard throughout our stay. Of particularinterest was the sighting on the evening of 8-24-99 of a Sharpshinned Hawk (<i>Acipiter striatus</i>) flying low over the trees and a possible glimpse of aSaw-whet Owl (<i>Aegolius acadicus</i>) in dense cover. Also in dense cover, the largest Woodchuck (<i>Marmota monax</i>) any of us had ever seen,  managed a stand-off with our dog.<p> Not long after our arrival a silent but very activeYellow-billed Cuckoo (<i>Coccyzus americanus</i>) in the crowns of some RedMaples caught our attention. Other birds seen near or at our camp were ChippingSparrow (<i>Spizella passerina</i>),  who begged for food almostunderfoot, Common Flicker (<i>Colaptes auratus</i>),  frequently-appearingWhite-breasted Nuthatch, Black-capped Chickadee (<i>Parus</i> <i>atricapillus</i>), Catbird (<i>Dumetella carolinensis</i>), Wood Pewee (<i>Contopus virens</i>), numerous Goldfinch (<i>Carduelis tristis</i>), Bluebird (<i>Sialia sialis</i>), American Crow (<i>Corvus brachyrhynchos</i>).  Phoebe (<i>Sayornis phoebe</i>), Junco (<i>Junco hyemalis</i>), Robin (<i>Turdus migratorius</i>), Blue Jay(<i>Cyanocitta cristata</i>), Screech owl (<i>Otis asio</i>) in evening and night, SongSparrow (<i>Melospiza melodia</i>), Scarlet Tanager (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>), including the female, Blue Grossbeak (<i>Guiraca caerulea</i>), Indigo Bunting (<i>Passerina cyanea</i>), White-eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo griseus</i>), Red-eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>) and numerouswarblers,including Black-throated Green (<i>Dendroica</i> <i>virens</i>), Yellow-rumped (<i>D. coronata</i>), Magnolia (<i>D. magnolia</i>), Redstart (<i>Setophaga ruticilla</i>) and Common Yellow-throat (<i>Geothypis trichas</i>). <p> Many small birds of different species appeared toflock together, appearing at some location, then another, some in the very topsof Spruce, darting out for insects on the wing, chasing each other rapidly inseeming enjoyment, perhaps in family groups, at the end of the breeding season,or exerting dominance. While these small birds could be seen at all arboreallevels, they were most abundant in the Alder thickets. There is where weidentified warblers at close range, particularly in the morning, theBlack-throated Green, Redstart, Yellow-rump, Magnolia and the CommonYellow-throat who boldly exhibited himself in the open. Our best observationsof these warblers as well as the female Scarlet Tanager and a number of otherspecies were made in these Alder thickets on the morning of 8-25-99 as rainthreatened.<p> An effort was also made to assess the fish in LaurelFork. Identified by R. Hunsucker with the aid of a fish trap were the following:<p> <i>Semotilus atromaculatus </i> (Creek Chub)<br> <i>Clinostomus funduloides</i> (Rosyside Dace)<br> <i>Rhinichthys atrotulus </i> (Blacknose Dace)<br> <i>Catostomus commersoni</i> (White Sucker)<p>&nbsp;</ul><p><b>Summary</b><ul><p> <p> As recognized on our August, 1993 visit, the forestin the area inventoried by us is among the most characteristically mesic of anyin the Central Appalachians and compares in this with the forest at ShaversFork ( see our section on Blister Run/Shavers Fork ). Not a single oak wasrecorded and but few pines, of which most were either dead or, as in the case of Red Pine (<i>Pinus resinosa</i>),  planted. Neither hickories nor a number of other genracharacteristic of the Central Appalachians were seen.. The character of the forest here is also markedly boreal forthese elevations, with a very high Yellow to Black Birch ratio ( only one BlackBirch seen ), and a number cold-climate plants such as Red Raspberry, SpeckledAlder and Drooping Wood Reed Grass that either never or seldom occur in thefolded Appalachians to the east. Also, the common occurrence of Red Sprucesaplings in the understory hint that this tree may once have been far morecommon than at present at these elevations and is now staging a comeback. Concomitantly missing are such mild climate species as Sycamore, Tuliptree,Wingstem (<i>Verbena alternifolia</i>) and Thin-leaved Sunflower(<i>Helianthus decapetalus</i>),  despite abundant otherwise suitable habitaton the flood plain. Consequently,  although many rich- soil indicators occuramong herbs and shrubs, the vegetation is climatically depauperate.  <p> More difficult to explain is the virtual absence ofericaceae and Great Rhododendron in particular, since the latter is a familiarof the cool, moist Alleghenies at all elevations. Furthermore, the sameenvironment that favors Great Rhododendron is also hospitable to mosses andliverworts, An example is Otter Creek ( see our section on Otter Creek ). Bycontrast, the Laurel Fork Valley is not so obviously characterized by a richflora of bryophytes.<p> These and other differences between Laurel fork andOtter Creek may be a consequence of the contrasting geology of the two areas.Limestone and associated alkaline waters and soils are confined to the vicinityof the lowest reaches of Otter Creek, while the largest part of the watershedis dominated by siliceous rocks of thePottsville Formation or equivalents- so much so indeed that in recent yearslimestone has been artificially added at a headwater facility to improve troutfishing. However limestone at Laurel Fork lies at the headwaters, where it canexert its influence on the entire mainstem and associated flood plaindownstream. Additionally, the rocks of the Hampshire Formation, which dominatemuch of the middle and lower Laurel Fork watershed, do not include massive sandstones like the Pottsville andits equivalents. Conspicuous expressions of these differences are theprevalence in the Otter Creek Valley of coarse, even bouldery alluvium andcolluvium, while that of Laurel Fork is comprised of small cobbles, sand andsilt that have given rise to broad flood plains and terraces. Thus it is likelythat geology plays an important if not dominant role in the floristics of thetwo watersheds.<p></ul><p><b>Acknowledgement</b><ul><p> We greatly appreciate the participation here, as onmany other of our expeditions, of Dorothy Simkins, especially her able identification of birds and relateddiscussions.</ul><p><b>References </b><ul><p>Cardwell, Dudley H., RobertB.
