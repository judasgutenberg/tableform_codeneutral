<h1>Little Wolf and Laurel Creeks</h1>
<p><b>Bland County, Virginia</b><br>
<i>April 2000</i>

<p><b>Source Walks: 7-1-99 and 7-2-99</b>
 
 



<p> The Little Wolf and Laurel Creeks are part of the
headwaters of Wolf Creek, a tributary of the New River. The area is underlain
by Devonian and Mississippian rocks of diverse lithologies. In upstream areas
the watershed of Little Wolf Creek is occupied by undifferentiated
Mississippian Maccrady Shale and Price Formation  (Rader and Evans, 1991) .
These rocks are succeeded downstream along Laurel Creek by the Chemung and
Brallier Formations of Devonian age. The Mississippian rocks appear to be the
most complex, with lithologies ranging from shales, siltstones and sandstones
to limestones and salt beds, at least in some areas of their occurrence.
Elevations in the areas of our inventories are in the range of 2500 feet  (763
m)  asl.
<p> On 7-1-99 a camp was established along Laurel Creek
at the site of an old quarry in siltstone about 1/4 mile  (0.4 km)  below the
confluence with Little Wolf Creek. The weather was warm, dry and pleasant, with
temperatures in the range of 80 deg F  (27 deg C) .
<p> Our
inventories here were conducted almost entirely during the afternoon of 7-199.
The first of these extended from a little downstream from our camp to the
Little Wolf confluence. The second extended perhaps 1/5 mile  (0.32 km) 
upstream along Little Wolf Creek on the Appalachian Trail.
<p> The road along Laurel Creek,State Route 615, was cut
into the lower slope, perhaps 20 feet  (6 m)  above the flood plain. The forest
on this slope and on the flood plain is 
of a rich acid-mesic Appalachian type, with a canopy dominated by Canada
hemlock, Black Birch, Yellow Buckeye, Tuliptree, White Basswood, Sugar and Red
Maples, Cucumbertree, Fraser Magnolia, Northern Red and Chestnut Oaks, White
Ash, Black Locust, Sycamore and a little White Pine and Sassafras. Where
Hemlock dominates, as on much of the slope above the road and on parts of the
flood plain, there are few shrubs and herbaceous plants, but where the canopy
is thinner, these show considerable diversity. Upstream, at the Little Wolf
confluence, there is a little Black Walnut, perhaps as a consequence of
limestone in the vicinity. Where the canopy is not too dense there is an
understory that includes Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>) and Sourwood  (<i>Oxydendrum arboreum</i>) and a shrub layer dominated
by Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) with common Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis 
virginiana</i>),  Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea arborescens</i>),  Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>),  as well as
minor components such as Pasture Rose (<i>Rosa carolina</i>) . Dutchman's Pipe Vine (<i>Aristolochia macrophylla</i>),  Summer Grape (<i>Vitis aestivalis</i>),  Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>), 
Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</i>) and Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus 
radicans</i>) were conspicuous vines.
<p> Our detailed inventory along the road was largely
confined to the upper road bank, which was under the influence of seeps from
the forest upslope and very little -except for dust - from the road gravel.
Presumably plants here correspond to those formed in small forest openings
under the existing microclimate and aspect. Species successively noted on
moving along the road toward the Little Wolf confluence from a little
downstream from our camp were as follows: Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella 
repens</i>) Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum lanuginosum</i>),  American Spikenard (<i>Aralia 
racemosa</i>),  Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>),  Bluntlobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica 
americana</i>),  Bracken Fern (<i>
Pteridium aquilinum</i>),  Black Cohosh
(<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>) in bloom, the forest sedge <i>Carex platyphylla</i>, Bowman's
Root (<i>Gillenia trifoliata</i>
), White Wood aster (<i>Aster divaricatus</i>) the sedges <i>Carex gracilescens </i>and <i>C. baileyi</i>, Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda 
claytoniana</i>),  Gaywings (<i>Polygala paucifolia</i>),  a Red-spotted Purple (<i>Lemenitis 
arthemis</i> <i>astyanax</i>) Butterfly, abundant Great
Rhododendron, Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens
</i>), Pale Green Orchis (<i>Habenaria flava</i>) in bloom, Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa 
bracteata</i>), Mountain Laurel, Broad-leaved Panic Grass (<i>Panicum</i> 
<i>latifolium</i>),  Whorled
Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia quadrifolia</i>) in bloom, Sassafras and
abundant Hemlock.
<p> Continuing under the dominantly acid regime, we saw
Mountain Bellwort (<i>Uvularia pudica</i>),  a Heartleaf (<i>Hexastylis </i> sp),  abundant Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>) and
Partridge Berry. However, also seen here was Virginia Srawberry (<i>Fragaria 
virginiana</i>) with ripe fruit, then <i>Carex gracillima</i>, a muhly
grass (<i>Muhlenbergia </i> sp),  Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia 
nudicaulis</i>),  Crooked-stem Aster (<i>Aster prenanthoides</i>),  the
large, beautiful moss <i>Brachythecium oxycladon</i>, Red Maple, the moss<i>Rhodobryum roseum</i> and Common
Greenbrier. These were followed by less characteristically acidiphile Filmy
Angelica (<i>Angelica triquinata</i>),  Purple Bedstraw (<i>Galium 
latifolium</i>) in bloom, four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>),  Pasture Rose, Horse Balm (
<i>Collinsonia canadensis</i>),  Shrubby St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum spathulatum</i>) and
Poke Milkweed (<i>Asclepias exaltata
</i>). Next seen however, was the acidiphile Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium virginianum</i>) on
sandstone, then our first White Oak, here with White Avens (<i>Geum 
canadense</i>),  and Cleavers (<i>Galium
aperine</i>) .
<p> The acid - mesic, but moisture and nutrient - rich
character of the road bank, as well as its heterogeneity is shown by the
interruption of dominant communities of such species as Teaberry and Partridge
Berry by species such as American Spikenard and Horse Balm that range into more
alkaline environments.
<p> At the Little Wolf Creek confluence the canopy
consisted of White Oak, Sugar Maple, Black Locust, Fraser Magnolia, Hemlock,
White Pine and Black Walnut. Then moving up the Appalachian Trail, along the
Little Wolf, we noted at the bridge crossing Black Birch, a few seemingly
healthy Beech, White Ash, Hemlock, Northern Red Oak, Tuliptree, Striped Maple,
abundant Great Rhododendron, Wild Hydrangea, seedlings of Black Oak, a
blackberry (<i>Rubus </i> sp),  Summer Grape, Common G&#19;reenbrier,
Dutchmann's Pipe Vine, Christmas Fern, Four-leaved Yam, White Wood Aster, <i>Carex 
platyphylla</i> and<i>C. 
digitalis</i>.
<p> Now climbing along the side of the steep - sided
ravine, we saw first Chestnut Oak and Witch Hazel,  then noted a deep, sandy
colluvial soil. This soil was occupied by a dominantly acidiphile community
consisting of Teaberry, Indian Cucumbr-root (<i>Medeola virginiana</i>), 
abundant Gall of the Earth (<i>Prenanthes</i> sp),  American Alumroot (<i>Heuchera 
americana</i>),  the wedge grass <i>Sphenopholis
 intermedia</i>
, Curtis Goldenrod, Blunt-lobe Hepatica
, Partridge Berry and Gaywings under a canopy dominated by Black Birch and
Tuliptree. A moss of the genus <i>Campylium</i> appeared to be common. Next seen were
Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigaea repens</i>),  Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphylla 
maculata</i>),  Wavy-leaf Aster (<i>Aster undulatus</i>), Crooked-stem Aster, Squaw
Root (<i>Conopholis americana</i>),  Southern Bellflower (<i>Campanula 
divaricata</i>),  Round-leaf Pyrola (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia</i>) in
bloom, American Chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>) sprouts, Jack-O-Lantern (<i>Ompholatus 
illudens</i>) fungus on the base of a moss-covered fallen tree, then
Wild Liquorice (<i>Galium circaezans</i>),  the woodrush<i>Luzula 
acuminata </i>and Halberd-leaf
Violet (<i>Viola hastata</i>) .
<p> We now saw the first New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris 
noveboracensis</i>),  the grass <i>Panicum boscii</i> 
and Mountain Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia compressa</i>),  then Heart-leaved Skullcap
(<i>Scutellaria ovata</i>) in bloom, followed by Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium 
filix-femina</i>),  Canada Brome Grass (<i>Bromus pubescens</i>),  the
forest bluegrass <i>Poa alsodes</i>, Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema 
triphyllum</i>),  Large Summer Bluets (<i>Houstonia purpurea</i>), 
Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda claytoniana</i>),  Basil Balm (<i>Monarda 
clinopodia</i>),  Early Meadowrue (<i>
Thalictrum dioicum</i>) and Black
Cohosh. A spot inventory of the canopy here yielded White Oak, Black Birch, Red
Maple, a little Shagbark Hickory and Tuliptree. 
<p> Advancing again, we encountered Downy Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum pubescens</i>),  American
Basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>),  a <i>Marasmius </i>fungus, abundant <i>Atrichum</i> moss  (likely <i>A. undulatum</i>),  Round-lobe Hepatica with
attractive varigated leaves, Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>),  then
Galax (<i>Galax aphylla</i>),  Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa uniflora</i>) and a large patch of ferns
comprised of a mixture of New York, Interrupted and Lady Fern, with the
last-named most abundant and vigorous - appearing. Immediately following were
Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana</i>),  the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum </i> and Dog
Lichen (<i>Peligera canina</i>) .
<p> Now, considering the prevailingly acid character of
this slope, we came upon what appeared to be a richer, more alkaline patch of
soil as indicated by the flora. This consisted of Canada Violet (<i>Viola 
canadensis</i>),  Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>),  Foam Flower (<i>Tiarella 
cordifolia</i>),  the mint <i>Meehania
 cordata</i>,
Hispid Greenbrier (<i>Smilax hispida</i>) and Wood Anemone (<i>Anemone</i> 
<i>quinquefolia</i>) . It is possible
that this community marks an alkaline seep,perhaps from a confined carbonate -
bearing stratum upslope.
<p> The slope a few meters above this community was
however occupied by a ledge of sandstone immediately below and upon which grew
more acidiphile plants. Notable among these was Wild Lily of the Valley (<i>Convallaria 
montana</i>),  while the sandstone itself bore Apple Moss (<i>Bartramia 
pomiformis</i>),  the moss <i>Aulocomnium heterostichum</i> and the fern Maidenhair Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium trichomanes</i>) .
<p> Again along the trail, we saw more Wood Nettle,
Canada Brome Grass and Smooth Rockcress (<i>Arabis laevigata</i>) ; then, in a marked return to acidiphiles, Great Rhododendron,
Galax, Cow Wheat (<i>Melampyrum lineare</i>),  Gay Wings, Teaberry, Southern
Bellflower, Bushy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum dichotomum</i>),  Mountain Bellwort, Bootts
Goldenrod (<i>Solidago boottii</i>) and Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum 
acerifolium</i>) . These occurred under Black Birch, Northern Red Oak
and Red Maple.
<p> Where a Dutchman's Pipe Vine ascended a small
trail-side sapling, we saw a caterpillar of the Pipe Vine Swallowtail Butterfly
(<i>Papilio philenor</i>) feeding on the vine. Here also we again noted the
very sandy soil, a characteristic that seemed to apply quite generally to this
slope. Other species tallied in the vicinity were Chestnut Oak, Mockernut
Hickory, another <i>Marasmius </i>fungus, Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium 
virginianum</i>),  Hairy Heuchera (<i>Heuchera villosa</i>) on a steep cliff and a large
brown and red millipede without detectable odor.

Fraser's Sedge along Little Wolf Creek, 7-1-99
</font>
</center>
<p>

<p> Now viewing the slope below, not far above the
stream, we were attracted by a vigorous patch of the uncommon Fraser's Sedge (<i>Cymophylus 
fraseri</i>),  a species we were also to see later along Laurel Creek.
At his point we descended to the stream.
<p> Of particular interest on the partially dry cobble
bar in the stream bed was the rather uncommon Rough Goldenrod (<i>Solidago 
patula</i>) . This tall, robust goldenrod, not yet in bloom, was
associated with Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa</i>),  Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio 
aureus</i>),  Common Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium fistulosum</i>),  Boneset (<i>E. 
perfoliatum</i>),  Panicled Aster (<i>Aster</i> <i>simplex</i>
), Flat-top White Aster (<i>A. umbellatus</i>) a lobelia, likely Cardinal
Flower (<i>Lobelia cardinalis</i>),  Deer-tongue Grass (<i>Panicum 
clandestinum</i>),  Small-fruited Panic Grass (<i>P. microcarpon</i>),  Fowl
Manna Grass (<i>Glyceria striata
</i>), the Creeping Five-leaf <i>Potentilla simplex</i>, Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis 
stricta</i>) and the stream sedge <i>Carex
torta</i>. . The thallus liverwort <i>Pallavicina lyellii 
</i>also occurred here. Small (
3 inch/ 8 cm)  fish, crayfish and the shed exoskeleton of a <i>Dolomedes 
</i>spider were seen in the stream. Our inventory here was terminated by
a threatening thundershower.
<p> The following additional fungi were collected and
identified from this traverse by R. Hunsucker: <i>Polyporus varius</i>, <i>Phellinus 
rimasus</i>, <i>Tyromyces chioneus</i>,
<i>Stereum 
ostrea</i>, <i>Pluteus cervinus</i>, <i>Fomitopsis cajander</i> and <i>Fomes
 fomentarius
</i>.
<p> On 7-2-99 R. Hunsucker inventoried a wet meadow
downstream from camp. Found there were Steel's Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium 
steelei</i>),  Sundrops (<i>Oenothera perennis</i>),  Swamp Rose (<i>Rosa 
palustris</i>),  Lance-leaved Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia lanceolata</i>) and
Winter Grape (<i>Vitis vulpina</i>) .
<p> Faunal observations at camp included the following:
<p> Surprisingly few birds were seen or heard. No forest
thrushes were noted, although American Robins (<i>Turdus migratorius</i>), 
Red-eyed Vireos (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>),  Indigo Buntings (<i>Passerina 
cyanea</i>) were regularly seen and/or heard, and on 7-2-99 a
Rose-breasted Grossbeak (<i>Pheucticus ludovicianus
</i>) and a Red-shouldered Hawk (<i>Buteo lineatus</i>) were heard. On the late
evening of 7-2-99 a Screech Owl (<i>Otus asio</i>) flew only a few meters overhead
and called frequently. Barred Owls (<i>Strix varia</i>) called from a considerable
distance on both nights. Ringneck (<i>Diadophis 
punctatus</i>) and Common Garter (<i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>) Snakes, both dead, were seen
on the road. 
<p> The generally heterogenious lithology,  particularly
of the Little Wolf watershed,  is reflected in the variation of floral type along the traverses. However the
dominance of acidiphile communities is clear and probably a consequence of the
general prevalence of siliceous rocks such as siltstones sandstones and shales.
In a few places, it appears, minor carbonate beds intervene with resultant
localized eutrophic flora.
