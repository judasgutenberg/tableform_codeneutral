<h1>Locust
Springs/ Laurel Fork</h1>
<strong>Highland County, Virginia</strong><br>
<i>August, 2004</i>
<blockquote>


 
 
 
 <ul>
<p>	The Locust Springs/Laurel Fork area, outlined in Figure 1, is a part of the George
Washington and Jefferson National Forests and lies just east of the
West Virginia line in Highland County, Virginia. Locust Springs, also
the location of a national forest picnic ground, falls in the extreme
northwest corner of the area. This is also the source area for both
Locust Spring Run and Buck Run. The outlined area  also indicates the
Laurel Fork Wilderness Study Area of the George Washington National
Forest. The area is bisected by Laurel Fork, a branch of the Potomac
River. Elevations range from 2600 feet  (793 m)  along Laurel Fork to
above 4000 ft  (1220 m)  at several locations on both sides of Laurel
Fork Stream. According to Keys et al  (1995)  the area falls partly
in the Northern High Allegheny Mountains Subsection of the Allegheny
Mountain Section and partly in the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the
Northern Ridge and Valley Section  (Figures 1 and 2, after Fleming
and Moorhead, 1996).  Bedrock geology  (Rader and Evans, 1993),  from
southeast to northwest and decreasing age, consists of bands of the
following formations:</p>

<p> Devonian Millboro
Shale &amp; underlying Needmore Formation. The Millboro is dark,
pyritic shale; gradational to the underlying Needmore, which consists
of dark shale, with thin beds of limestone and Tioga metabentonite.  
</p>
<p>
<p>Devonian Brallier
Formation consisting of interbedded shale and sandstone</p>
<p>
<p>Devonian Chemung
Formation, consisting of dark, fine-grained lithic sandstone and
interbedded gray shale.</p>
<p>
<p>Devonian Hampshire
Formation, consisting of fine-grained and conglomeratic and massive
sandstone and interbedded mudstone.</p>
<p>
<p>Mississippian Pocono
Formation, consisting of light, resistant, quartzitic sandstone and
interbedded shale.</p>
<p>
<p>In
terms of landforms, the major northwestern part of the area falls in
the Northern High Allegheny Subsection  (Keys et al, 1995), while a
smaller part, in the extreme southeastern part of the area, falls in
the Ridge and Valley Section. It contains the southeast facing scarp
slope  (Figure 1)  that contrasts greatly with the rest of the
topography. With reference to Figure 1 and 2, the Ridge and Valley
Section occupies an approximately one kilometer-wide band  (the scarp
slope)  of the extreme southeast end of the National Forest tract,
and this is underlain by the Millboro,  Needmore and and Brallier
Formations. A roughly parallel band with a width that extends from
the crest of Middle Mountain to Laurel Fork Stream, is underlain by
Chemung Formation, while Hampshire Formation underlies a parallel
band on Allegheny Mountain to within approximately 1.5 km of the
northwest edge of the National Forest tract. Finally, the
aforementioned 1.5 km-wide band is underlain by Pocono Formation.</p>
<p>Laurel
Fork is one of only a few centers of boreal diversity in Virginia
harboring such species as the Northern Flying Squirrel  (<i>Glaucomys
 sabrinus</i>),  Snowshoe Hare  (<i> Lepus  americanus</i>), 
Northern Saw-whet Owl   (<i>Aegolius  funereus</i>)  and numerous
other birds, insects and plants of northern distribution. Many of
these have already been encountered in our West Virginia inventories
and will be mentioned only as they appear in our survey here. As is
usual in this work, scientific names, with few exceptions, will be
given only on first mention. 
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Source Walks: 9-1-89 and 7-19-90</h2>
<ul>These  walks
are in the nature of  reconnaissances, and we do not here report a
number of species noted, but which are covered in greater detail in
later inventories. However, they do reveal several species and 
occurrences of special interest. Reference is made to accompanying
photographs from these walks. The 9-1-89 walks were along the heads
of Bearwallow  and Slabcamp Runs, two of the six major tributaries of
Laurel Fork that flow directly southeast to join it. First, as we
left our vehicle, we noted a mature Fraser Magnolia  (<i>Magnolia 
fraseri</i>)  growing along the access road Route 55. Then entering
the scrubby open forest at  the head of Slabcamp Run for some
distance, we identified a very small sapling of Trembling Aspen (
<i>Populus  tremuloides</i>),  and this is the only example of the
species identified either by us or Fleming and Moorhead  (1996)  in
the entire area. The head of Slabcamp and Bearwallow Runs exhibit
good examples of the reclamation of old fields by woody vegetation,
such as Red Spruce, Black Locust  (<i>Robinia  pseudoacacia</i>)  and
hawthorn, in particular Dotted Thorn  (<i>Crataegus  punctatus</i>), 
as shown in the photographs. Also along  Slabcamp Run,  we observed 
initially what we took to be a  Smooth Green Snake  (<i>Liochlorophis
</i> <i>vernalis </i>), based on this boreal habitat. However, the
snake, about 16 inches in length, was soon joined by an unidentified
Fritillary butterfly which perched on it in one of those peculiar
juxtapositions of nature we've come to expect! 
</p>
<p>	Our 7-19-90 walk was
to the beaver ponds at the head of Buck Run. On the way from the
picnic ground at Locust Springs we noted Red Elderberry  (<i>Sanbucus
 pubens</i>)  and the largest sapling of American Chestnut  (<i>Castanea</i>
 <i>dentata</i>)  ever seen by this reporter. This tree, in this area
in which the species appears not to have been common, was
approximately 6 inches  (15 cm)  dbh rose to perhaps 35 feet  (11 m) 
in height and appeared healthy..</p>
<p>
</ul>
<h2>Source Walks: 8-9-96</h2>
<ul>
<p>	Our first inventory
was conducted in the vicinity of the Locust Springs picnic ground.
Although time was not adequate to determine the true history of the
forest at this location, it appeared to consist of a mosaic of
immature Red Spruce  (<i>Picea  rubens</i>)  and more mature northern
hardwood. Large Northern Red Oak  (<i> Quercus  rubra</i>)  with
spreading crowns, indicating early growth in the open, dominated the
latter, but smaller Red Maple  (<i>Acer  rubrum</i>),  Black Locust,
Black Cherry  (<i>Prunus  serotina</i>),  American Beech  (<i>Fagus 
grandifolia</i>),  Black and Yellow Birches   (<i>Betula  lenta  and 
B. alleghaniensis</i>)  were also common canopy species. White Pine 
 (<i> Pinus  strobus</i>) also occurs, and, like most of the Red
Spruce, appears to have been planted.</p>
<p>	Macrolichens were
conspicuous, especially on Red Maple. Identified by R. Hunsucker,
were a species of <i>Pseudevernia</i>,<i> Parmelia rudecta</i>, <i>P.
sulcata</i>, <i>P. squarrosa</i>, <i>Pseudoparmelia caperata</i>,
<i>Parmotrema stuppeum</i> and <i>Hypogymnia physodes.</i></p>
<p>	Understory species
noted were serviceberry (<i> Amelanchier</i> sp),  Striped Maple (<i>
Acer  pensylvanicum</i>)  and Mountain Holly  (<i>Ilex montana </i>).
Shrubs, in order of diminishing size were Mountain Laurel    (<i>Kalmia
 latifolia</i>),  Thornless Blackberry  (<i>Rubus canadensis </i>),
Mountain Azalea  (<i>Rhododendron roseum </i>), Minnie-bush (
<i>Menziesia  pilosa </i>), Deer Berry  (<i>Vaccinium stamineum </i>)
and Early Low Blueberry (<i> V</i>. <i>angustifolium </i>). A
chokeberry,  (likely <i>Aronia melanocarpa </i>)<i> </i>was present
in moist areas. Ground cover consisted of abundant Teaberry (
<i>Gaultheria procumbens </i>), Trailing Arbutus (<i> Epigaea repens
</i>), Round-leaf Pyrola  (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia</i>),  Partridge
Berry  (<i>Mitchella repens</i>),  Canada Mayflower  (<i>Maianthemum
canadense</i>),  Common Speedwell  (<i>Veronica officinalis </i>),
Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<i> Goodyera pubescens </i>), Wood Betony
 (<i>Pedicularis canadensis </i>), Spotted Jewelweed (<i> Impatiens
capensis</i>),  Filmy Angelica  (<i>Angelica triquinata </i>),
Woodland Strawberry  (<i>Fragaria vesca </i>), Virginia Strawberry (<i>
F. virginiana</i>),  the bullrush <i>Scirpus atrovirens,</i> Tree
Clubmoss  (<i>Lycopodium obscurum </i>), Ground Pine  (<i>L.
flabelliforme </i>), an unidentified meadowrue  (<i>Thalictrum </i>sp) and Millet Grass (<i> Millium effusum </i>) with remains of seeds.</p>
<p>	Mosses were common and
included an unidentified haircap (<i> Polytrichum </i>sp).  A small
wetland a little to the east of the picnic area was dominated by
<i>Sphagnum</i> with haircap moss  (<i>Polytrichum </i> sp),  both of
unidentified species. Also present in the wetland were tall culms of
the bulrush  <i>Scirpus pendulus, Carex baileyi, C</i>. gynandra,
Cinnamon Fern (<i> Osmunda cinnamomea </i>), New York Fern (
<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis </i>) and the Chokeberry referred to
earlier. The wetland was fringed by forest consisting largely of Red
Maple and Red Spruce in which<i> Carex debilis  </i>occurred. On the
Trail to some Beaver  (<i>Castor  canadensis</i> )  ponds, we
encountered in succession the manna grass <i>Glyceria melicaria,
Carex digitalis</i>, Fire Cherry  (<i>Prunus pensylvanica </i>),
Witch Hazel  (<i>Hamamelis virginiana </i>), the many-leaved bulrush 
<i>Scirpus polyphyllus</i>, Sugar Maple (<i> Acer  saccharum </i>), 
Clearweed  (<i>Pilea pumila</i>)  in a seep, White Grass  (<i>Leersia
virginica </i>); then in a patch of more fertile soil, Wood Nettle (
<i>Laportea canadensis </i>), Smooth Gooseberry  (<i>Ribes
rotundifolium</i>),  Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i> Galium triflorum </i>)
and Tall Agrimony  (<i>Agrimonia gryposepala </i>).</p>
<p>	At the beaver pond, in
a setting of a heavy stand of immature Red Spruce, we saw Cedar
Waxwings  (<i>Bombycilla cedrorum </i>) foraging in the tops of the
latter. Also Green Frogs (<i> Rana clamitans </i>) were heard, a
Mallard  (<i>Anas platyrhynchos </i>) was flushed and the wake of a
Beaver was apparent as it swam beneath the surface. Trees, in
addition to Red Spruce, included abundant Yellow Birch, Northern Red
Oak, Sugar Maple, Beech and various basswoods, some with the
characteristics of  <i>Tillia americana</i> and some with the
characteristics of White Basswood  (<i>T. heterophylla</i> or <i>T. 
americana </i> var  <i>heterophylla </i>). Smaller trees and shrubs
seen were Hophornbeam    (<i>Ostrya  virginiana</i>),  Mountain
Holly, Mountain Laurel, Early Low Blueberry and one of the tallest
bushes of Upland Low Blueberry  (<i> Vaccinium  pallidum</i>)  ever
seen by this observer. Observed ground cover in the acid soil under
the Spruce included Intermediate Shield Fern  (<i>Dryopteris
intermedia </i>), Common Club Moss  (<i>Lycopodium clavatum </i>),
Tree Clubmoss, Ground Pine, Indian Cucumber-root  (<i>Medeola
virginiana </i>), Canada Mayflower, Round-leaf Violet  (<i>Viola
rotundifolia </i>), Pinesap  (<i>Monotropa hypopithys </i>), Northern
Bugleweed  (<i>Lycopus uniflorus </i>), Dotted St. John's-wort (
<i>Hypericum punctatum</i>),  patches of the liverwort<i> Bazzania
trilobata</i>  and some large specimens of the fungus <i>Amanita
muscaria.</i></p>
<p>	Fungi identified in the area as a whole by R. Hunsucker were</p>
<ul>	
<br>	 <i>Amanita  muscaria</i>
<br>	 <i>Amanita parcivoluata</i>
<br>	 <i>Amanita  rubescens</i>
<br>	 <i>Armilliariella mellea</i>
<br>             <i>Boletus badius</i>

<h2>Source Walks:
8-25-03 and 8-26-03</h2>
<ul>
<p>	 In the afternoon of
8-25-03, under pleasant weather conditions, a  preliminary foray was
made to Locust Springs and the beaver ponds at the head of Buck Run.
Although no systematic inventory was undertaken, a soaring Black
Vulture  (<i>Coragyps  atratus</i>)  and Cedar Waxwings were observed
, several plants were noted and some collected for later
identification. Identified in place were Hairgrass   (<i>Agrostis 
hyemalis  </i>), Northern Bugleweed  (<i>Lycopus  uniflorus</i>), 
Arrow-leaf Tearthumb  (<i>Polgonum  sagittatum</i>),  and later, the
rushes<i> Juncus  subcaudatus</i> and <i>J.  brevicaudatus.</i></p>
<p>	A soil temperature
reading  (T-707)  was also made at the usual depth  (5 inches / 13 cm) in needle duff under Red Spruce on a flat aspect not far from the
large pond. Obtained was T= 15.5 deg C. To see this temperature in
relation to other Central Appalachian soil temperatures refer to
Mueller  (2004). </p>
<p>	On the morning of
8-26-03, again under pleasant weather conditions, we returned to the
larges  (lower) Beaver pond area for an inventory of the
Spruce-wetland meadow ecotone on the pond's south side, as well as
the meadow itself. If a cross section ~30 meters in length
perpendicular to the pond meadow edge is considered, the following
microhabitats are encountered: young Red Spruce with a shrub layer of
chiefly Early Low Blueberry, with abundant Ground Pine, Common
Clubmoss, Canada Mayflower, Partridge Berry,  with patches of
acidiphile bryophytes including unidentified species of Sphagnum
moss. Few if any current year Spruce seedlings were seen. Beyond the
Spruce there were small drainage swales with exposed cream-colored to
tan clay bottoms leading from the Spruce forest to the pond. Sphagnum
was common in these swales and on flat seepy areas between them.
Higher areas contained clumps and patches of Early Low Blueberry,
large shrubs of Mountain Laurel, Common Club Moss, Tree Clubmoss and
the haircap moss <i>Polytrichum  commune</i>..  New York and
Hay-scented  (<i>Dennstaedtia  punctilobula</i>)  Ferns formed
patches both within the forest and beyond its edges, and there were
also individuals and patches of Cinnamon Fern  (<i>Osmunda 
cinnamomea</i>).  In many places the swale acid-flora was bordered on
the pond side by extensive, dense growths of grasses, sedges and
forbs. On and within the pond's shallow edge waters was a variety of
grasses, sedges, rushes and aquatic plants such as species of
<i>Potamogeton</i> and <i>Sparganium.</i> This flora has a far more
eutrophic appearance than the acidiphile and low flora in and near
the Spruce. Our detailed inventory yielded the following:</p>
<p> 	The fungus Golden
Spindles  (<i>Clavaria  fusiformis</i>)  at the forest edge; abundant
New York Fern, Mountain Laurel, Common Clubmoss and Ground Pine, also
at the forest edge,. abundant  Mountain Oat Grass  (<i>Danthonia 
compressa </i>), Hairgrass, Slender Mannagrass  (<i>Glyceria 
melicaria</i>),  Hay-scented Fern, Stonewort  (a species of the alga
<i>Nitella</i>)  in the water, and over a wide area of meadow,
numerous blooming Bog Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago  uliginosa</i>). On
near plants of this goldenrod numerous busy bumblebees could be
observed, many with their pollen sacks bulging to capacity. However,
no Honeybees  (<i>Apis  mellifera </i>) were observed, in testimony
to the effectiveness of parasites and disease in recent years Also
observed again were numerous Cedar Waxwings, in the very tops of
trees.</p>
<p>	Where the level Beaver
meadow was punctuated by elevated areas, Early Low Blueberry and
Mountain Laurel held sway. In one place we identified Northern
Dewberry  (<i>Rubus  flagellaris </i>). Next seen were more Tree
Clubmoss, Cinnamon Fern, Soft Rush  (<i>Juncus  effusus</i>), 
Hairgrass, Slender St. John's-wort  (<i>Hypericum  mutilum</i>)  in
full bloom, <i>Carex  lurida, Carex  debilis,</i>,  Flat-top White
Aster  (<i>Aster  umbellatus</i>)  also in full bloom, then small
Spruce Saplings, seedlings of Downy Serviceberry  (<i>Amelanchier 
arborea</i>), Blunt Spikerush  (<i>Eleocharis  obtusa</i>),  Small
Bur Reed  (<i>Sparganium  chlorocarpum</i>),  Grassy Pondweed (
<i>Potamogeton  gramineus</i>),  the grass <i>Panicum  lanuginosum</i>
 var  <i>fasciculatum </i>, Clayton's Bedstraw  (<i>Galium 
tinctorium</i>),  seedlings of Red Maple, the sedge <i>Scirpus 
cyperinus, </i>Rough-leaf Goldenrod<i> </i> (<i>Solidago  rugosa</i>) also in bloom, the alien Velvet Grass  (<i>Holcus  lanatus</i>), 
Rice Cutgrass  (<i>Leerzia</i>  <i>oryzoides </i>,the main wet-zone
grass),  Slender Spikerush  (<i>Eleocharis  tenuis</i>),  Autumn Bent
Grass  (<i>Agrostis </i> <i>perennans </i>), Arrow-leaf Tearthumb,
Marsh St. John's Wort  (<i>Triadenum  virginicum</i>),  <i>Carex 
gynandra, Carex</i>  <i>scoparia,</i> Creeping five-leaf  (<i>Potentilla
 canadensis/simplex</i>)  intergrowth with Sphagnum moss, seedlings
of Black Birch  (identification based on strong taste),  a
Silver-spotted Skipper  (<i>Epargyreus  clarus</i>),  a small
unidentified frog, Bailey's Sedge  (<i>Carex  baileyi </i>), the
fungus <i>Laccaria  laccata, </i>Narrow-leaved Willowherb  (<i>Epilobium
 leptophyllum</i>)  in full bloom, the alien Orchard Grass  (<i>Dactylis
 glomerata </i>), Bracken Fern  (<i>Pteridium  aquilinum</i>),  <i>Carex
 atlantica</i>  var  <i>atlantica</i>, Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel (
<i>Oxalis  stricta</i>) ; then on an elevation with a Red Spruce
sapling, Mountain Laurel and Early Low Blueberry, we encountered the
following mosses: <i>Leucobryum  glaucum, Pleurozium  schreberi,
Dicranella</i>  <i>heteromalla</i> and <i>Hypnum  curvifolium.</i>
This elevation is just below the massive old Beaver dam, now
overgrown with grasses and forbs, but which a 1990 photo shows to be
comprised of relatively fresh appearing sticks, as was also a large
lodge in the pond. 
</p>
<p>Also
seen were a Wood Pewee  (<i>Contopus  virens</i>)  and a
Ruby-throated Hummingbird  (<i>Archilochus  colubris</i>)  on an
unidentified thistle..</p>

<h2>The Work of Fleming and Moorhead  (1996) </h2>
<ul>
<p>
<p>	 That this important
research deserves wider dissemination than is afforded by a Natural
Heritage Technical Report is in part the reason for the detailed
treatment presented here.</p>
<p>In
what follows,  text composition is this reporter's, but he has
frequently adopted Fleming and Moorhead's phrasing in individual
statements without particular attribution, sometimes in altered form,
always in the interest of brevity or clarity, In some cases
paraphrase is used, and in one case direct quotation. Some scientific
names have been changed in the interest of conformity to usage in
other sections of our Project. However their common names for a
number of sedges and a few other plants were adopted. Finally, much
of the material dealing with the classification of forest types in
the original document has been omitted. For greater detail and a
comprehensive bibliography, the reader is referred to the original
document.</p>
<p>
Fleming and Moorhead  (1996)  made a comprehensive and largely
successful effort to relate the floras of Laurel Fork to their
ecological land units as determined by Harbor  (1996).  These
forests, which are comprised of a number of types, are all secondary
and have suffered the devastation of reckless logging and fires. As a
result canopy dominance by certain species is often a direct
consequence of post logging or fire conditions, which favored these
species.</p>
<p>By
far the most common type of forest in the area is northern hardwood,
which covers more than 50 % of the area and consists of such species
as Sugar and Red Maples, American Beech, Yellow and Black Birches,
Black Cherry, Northern Red Oak, White Ash  (<i>Fraxinus  americana</i>) and American Basswood  (<i>Tilia  americana</i>).  Understory and
shrub layers  are dominated by Hophornbeam, Striped Maple, Mountain
Maple  (<i>Acer  spicatum</i>),  Red Elderberry and Hobblebush (
<i>Viburnum  alnifolium</i>). Although not mentioned by Fleming and
Moorhead, the original forests of this type should also have been
prime habitat for the evergreen shrub Canada Yew  (<i>Taxus 
canadensis</i>),  a species which was once common in the Central
Appalachians and still occurs in trace numbers in similar forests in
West Virginia. Most northern hardwood forest types occur in areas
that are regarded as having &quot;frigid&quot; soils, or those soils
with average annual temperatures less than 47 deg F  (8.3 deg C). 
The area in which they occur  is also one of relatively high
precipitation compared to the Ridge and Valley Section to the east.
As emphasized by Fleming and Moorhead, this characteristic likely
protected the original primary forests from wildfires, to which they
became vulnerable only after logging produced incendiary conditions.</p>
<p>	Fleming and Moorhead
distinguished the Landtype Phase of Northern Hardwoods of Fertile
Slopes and Hollows  (Phase 1)  from the Landtype Phase of Moderately
Fertile Slopes and Crests  (Phase 2)  and that of Infertile Slopes
and Crests  (Phase 3).  In addition to the presence of such trees as
White Ash and basswood, herbs are good indicators of soil fertility.
Those which characterize fertile slopes and hollows, as well as cool
soils, include particularly Blue Cohosh  (<i>Caulophyllum 
thalictroides</i>),  Wood Nettle, Canada violet  (<i>Viola 
canadensis</i>),  Ramps  (<i>Allium  tricoccum</i>),  Carolina Spring
Beauty  (<i>Claytonia  caroliniana</i>),  Squirrel Corn  (<i>Dicentra
 canadensis </i>) and Dwarf Ginseng  (<i>Panax  trifolius</i>).  Of
course, these forests also include species of wider distribution such
as May Apple  (<i>Podophyllum  peltatum</i>),  Maidenhair Fern (
<i>Adiantum </i> <i>pedatum</i>),  Wild Ginger  (<i>Asarum  canadense</i>) and Black Cohosh  (<i>Cimicifuga  racemosa </i>). These fertile
soils are generally characterized by higher values of pH,  bases such
as calcium and magnesium, as well as other nutrients, when compared
to less fertile soils. Average values of pH, calcium and magnesium
for 12 plots were 4.4, 1,314 ppm and 120 ppm respectively. However,
some samples combined high nutrient values with pH values in the
range of 3.5-4.0.  It will be interesting to compare flora of this
forest type with that of the Mixed Hardwood Forests of the Scarp
Slope Hollows of the Ridge and Valley Section  (see later). </p>
<p>When
we consider the forests on somewhat less fertile soils such as those
of Moderately Fertile Slopes  and Crests  (Landtype Phase 2),  we
note a decrease in critical element values, with pH, calcium and
magnesium averaging 3.7, 148 ppm and 28 ppm respectively.  Associated
with these values is an  increase in species tolerant of these
conditions. Examples are Hay-scented and New York Ferns, Curtis
Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago  curtisii</i>) ; Sweet White Violet  (<i>Viola
 blanda</i>),  a variety of sedges and grasses, and numerous tree
seedlings of such species as Black Cherry, largely as influenced by
Deer browsing, 
</p>
<p>In
forests of Infertile Slopes and Crests  (Landtype Phase 3),  average
values of key elements were pH = 3.5, calcium = 128 ppm and magnesium
= 22 ppm. and forbs, grasses and sedges largely give way to the<i> </i>
a sparse distribution of  strong acidiphiles  such as Stiff Clubmoss
 (<i>Lycopodium  annotinum</i>),  Indian Cucumberroot  (<i>Medeola 
virginiana</i>),  Indian pipe  (<i>Monotropa  uniflora</i>),  Downy
Rattlesnake Plantain  (<i>Goodyera  pubescens</i>)  and Canada
Mayflower. An abundance of woody seedlings, particularly of maples,
Beech, Cucumbertree, Mountain Holly and Mountain Laurel is also
typical, and herbaceous diversity is extremely low in these
communities.</p>
<p>	The Landtype Phase of
Eastern  (Canada)  Hemlock-Birch Forests of Infertile Slopes and
Bouldery Colluvium is a 4th type identified. It is represented by
mixed stands of Hemlock-birch and rarely by nearly pure stands of
Hemlock. Many of the stands are in an early, strongly stratified
stage of development,  with even-aged Yellow and Black birches
occupying the canopy and dense Hemlock occupying the subcanopy and
shrub layers. Also present are scattered Red Maple, Black Cherry,
White Pine and Red Spruce. Small tree and shrub species include
Striped Maple, Mountain Maple, serviceberry  (<i>Amelanchier </i> sp), Mountain Holly, Hobblebush, Mountain Laurel, Witch Hazel, Red
Elderberry and Northern Bush Honeysuckle  (<i>Diervilla  lonicera</i>). Soils are frigid and very acidic, with pH in the vicinity of 3.7
and low base values. The bouldery habitat favors Intermediate Shield
Fern  (<i>Dryopteris  intermedia</i>)  in the herb layer, as well as
a community similar to forests of  Landtype Phase 3. At the time of
this survey some Hemlock were already infested by the Hemlock Wooly
Adelgid  (<i>Adelges  tsugae</i>). </p>
<p>,	A 5th Landtype Phase
of American Beech Forests of South and West Facing Slopes, identified
by Fleming and Moorhead, consists largely of American Beech, with
some Red Maple, Black Birch, Black Cherry, Northern Red Oak,
Cucumbertree and Big-tooth Aspen  (<i>Populus  grandidentata</i>). 
As might be expected, soils are acidic and relatively infertile, with
pH, calcium and magnesium at 3.5, 120 ppm and 21 ppm respectively. It
is inferred that the beech may have resulted from suckering of
fire-killed cull trees after logging.</p>
<p>	A very minor Landtype
Phase, The 6th, is that of Bigtooth Aspen Forests of Severely Burned
Slopes. Like  many of the foregoing types, soils are highly acidic
and this is reflected in the herb layer, which is dominated by  such
species as Hay-scented Fern and other acidiphiles.</p>
<p>	The 7th Landtype Phase
is that of Red Spruce Forests of Stream-head Valleys. It occupies
broad, unicised valley floors and foot slopes along the upper Buck,
Slabcamp, Bearwallow and Newman Runs  (see Figure i)  Soils are
frigid and very acidic, with pH generally less than 4. We have
already encountered this forest type in our source walks,
particularly at Buck Run and to a lesser degree art Bearwallow and
Slabcamp Runs. The most frequent canopy associates of Red Spruce are
Red Maple, Hemlock, Yellow and Black Birches, Black Cherry and
Northern Red Oak. Spruce is the most important species in the small
tree and shrub layers, along with Hemlock and some hardwoods. As
found in our source walks, shrubs include Mountain Laurel and
blueberries, while a herbaceous ground cover is formed by sparse
clubmosses, White Wood Sorrel, Intermediate Shield Fern, Canada
Mayflower, Teaberry, Large Round-leaved Orchid  (<i>Habenaria 
orbiculata</i>),  Shinleaf  (<i>Pyrola  elliptica </i>),  Painted
Trillium  (<i>Trillium undulatum</i>)  and other acidiphiles. In more
open stands Dotted Thorn is accompanied by the uncommon  Purple
Oatgrass  (<i>Schizachne  purpurascens</i>). In some poorly drained
stream sides and seeps, in a more eutrophic environment, one may find
White Hellebore  (<i>Veratrum  viride</i>),  Marsh Marigold  (<i>Caltha
 palustris</i>),  Marsh Blue Violet  (<i>Viola  cucullata</i>), 
Drooping Wood Reed Grass  (<i>Cinna </i> l<i>atifolia</i>), 
Three-seed Sedge  (<i>Carex  trisperma</i>)  and Leafy Bulrush (
<i>Scirpus  polyphyllus</i>). </p>
<p>	An example of the 8th
Landtype Phase, represented by Wetland Glades and Beaver Meadows, was
the subject of our previously reported inventories along the head of
Buck Run. According to Fleming and Moorhead, this landtype is
restricted to the Allegheny Mountain section of the study area. It
occupies narrow zones of the upper, unincised valley floors along
Buck Run, Locust Spring Run  (north and south branches) and 
Slabcamp, Bearwallow and Newman Runs. Near the crest of Middle
Mountain it occupies a small headwaters swale in one of the truncated
valleys,  and also occurs in one locality of the alluvial flats along
Laurel Fork. It is associated with cold, wet open sites that have
been affected by logging and Beavers. The soils of the Allegheny
Mountain stream heads are frigid and generally quite acid. Along most
of Allegheny Mountain stream-heads, young Spruce reproduction and
Early Low Blueberry occupy hummocks in and around the wetlands, as
described previously.</p>
<p>	Among additional
species not recorded in our inventories are Minnie-bush, Crested
Shield Fern  (<i>Dryopteris  cristata</i>),  Hairy Willowherb (
<i>Epilobium  ciliatum</i>),  American Water Pennywort  (<i>Hydrocotyle
 americana</i>),  Closed Gentian  (<i>Gentiana  clausa</i>),  Mash
fern  (<i>Thelypteris  palustris</i>)  and Three-seeded Sedge.</p>
<p>	The 9th Landtype Phase
is represented by Northern Hardwood Forests of Valley Floors. This
Landtype Phase is confined to the Allegheny Mountain Section of the
study area. It is characteristic of the incised stream valleys of
deeply dissected terrain on both Allegheny and Middle Mountains, with
attenuated occurrences in the high,  gently dissected landtype on
Allegheny Mountain. Soils are frigid and acid, with pH values in the
neighborhood of 3.7.</p>
<p>	Valley floor
vegetation in the Laurel Fork area is characterized by northern
hardwood forest with Yellow Birch as a dominant or co-dominant tree.
Due to numerous microhabitats in this Landtype Phase, it was found to
have the greatest shrub and herb diversity of any in the study area.</p>
<p>	While Yellow Birch
generally dominates, Red Maple is commonly a co-dominant, with Sugar
Maple, Black Birch,  Beech, White Ash, Northern Red Oak, Basswood,
Black Cherry, Hemlock and Red Spruce as other canopy species. Most
canopy species appear to be 60-75 years in age  (in 2004)..Sub-canopy layers contain higher proportions of Sugar Maple and
Beech than the canopy, while shrub layers consist of sparse Sugar
Maple, Beech, Mountain Maple, Witch Hazel,  Hobblebush and Wild
Hydrangea  (<i>Hydrangea  arborescens</i>). </p>
<p>	On relatively
well-drained areas White Wood Sorrel forms extensive carpets.
Accompanying  herbs are Stiff Clubmoss, Hay-scented, New York  and
Intermediate Shield Ferns,  Drooping Wood Reed Grass, Sweet White
Violet, Canada Mayflower, Finely-nerved Sedge  (<i>Carex  leptonervia</i>), Slender Wood Sedge  (<i>Carex  digitalis</i>),  Round-leaf Violet,
Indian Turnip, Crooked-stem Aster, Rosy Twisted Stalk  (<i>Streptopus
 roseus</i>),  Filmy Angelica,  Golden Ragwort  (<i>Senecio  aureus</i>), Hairy Disporum  (<i>Disporum  lanuginosum</i>),  Creeping Phlox (
<i>Phlox  stolonifera</i>),   Hairy Woodrush  (<i>Luzula  acuminata</i>), Wide-leaf  Joe-pye Weed  (<i>Eupatorium  purpureum</i>),  Hooked
Crowfoot  (<i>Ranunculus  recurvatus</i> ),  Clearweed (<i> Pilea 
pumila </i>), Interrupted Fern, Fragile Fern  (<i>Cystopteris  tenuis</i>), Foamflower, Alpine Enchanter's Nightshade  (<i>Circaea  alpina</i>),Broad-leaved Sedge  (C<i>arex  platyphylla </i>) and the rare
species Black Sedge  (<i>Carex  arctata</i>),  Blue Ridge St.
Johnswort  (<i>Hypericum  mitchellianum</i>),  Purple Oatgrass,
Millet Grass. and White Monkshood  (<i>Aconitum </i> <i>reclinatum</i>). 
</p>
<p>	A distinctive wetland
suit of this community type is developed in seepage zones and along
saturated abandoned meanders. This suit is dominated by Rough Sedge (<i>Carex  scabrata</i>),  with Lettuce Saxifrage  (<i>Saxifraga 
micrathidfolia</i>),  White Hellibore, Marsh Blue Violet, Slender
Mannagrass, Mad-dog Skullcap  (<i>Scutellaria  lateriflora</i>), 
American Speedwell  (<i>Veronica  americana</i>),  Turtlehead (<i>Chelone  glabra</i>),  Golden Saxifrage  (<i>Chrysosplenium 
americanum</i>),  Drooping Sedge  (<i>Carex  prasina</i>),  Northern
White Violet  (<i>Viola  pallens</i>),  Spotted Water Hemlock (<i>Cicuta  maculata</i>),  Spotted Jewelweed, Miterwort  (<i>Mitella 
diphylla</i>)  and Oswego Tea  (<i>Monarda  didyma</i>)  as
associates.</p>
<p>	The rocky streams and
stream banks of this phase are prime habitat for the Water Shrew (<i>Sorex  palustris</i>),  a northern mammal known in Virginia only
from Highland and Bath Counties.</p>
<p>	Closely related to the
above is the 10th Landtype Phase, that of Forested Alluvial Flood
Plains, Terraces and Stream-fronting Slopes. It is confined to the
Allegheny Mountain section of the study area. It is the most
characteristic and extensively developed phase of the major stream
valley landtype. which encompasses the alluvial floor, terraces,
fans, meanders and stream-fronting slopes of the Laurel Fork Valley.
The unit occupies all topographic positions in the Landtype, with the
exception of the active steam channel shelf and is comprised of
habitats which are most influenced by dynamic alluvial processes.
Soils are frigid, but perhaps less acid and richer in nutrients than
those of most of the landtype phases previously described, since they
are in part developed on alluvium derived from a greater variety of
rock types than the latter. Forests are generally similar to those of
Landtype Phase 9 in species composition. However, Great Rhododendron
is an important component and covers much of the Valley floor. Also,
<i>Tuliptree</i>  (<i>Liriodendron  tulipifera</i>)  occurs at the
lowest elevations. Red Spruce has a scattered presence in birch and
Hemlock forests down to an elevation of about 3,100 feet  (945 m). </p>
<p>	Great Rhododendron
characterizes the Yellow Birch stands of the Valley floor, but it
also ascends steep, stream-fronting slopes of various aspects to form
thickets in a variety of community types. Fleming and Moorhead
speculate that the presence of Rhododendron may be related to
enhanced humidity generated by the large and relatively sheltered
stream valley, an opinion also arrived at by this reporter with
respect to other occurrences of the species  (see <a href=horseshoe.htm>our Horseshoe
Run/Dorman Ridge Section</a>). </p>
<p>	Landtype Phase 11 is
represented by Regularly Flooded Bouldery Stream Banks and Cobble
Bars. The landtype is confined to the Allegheny Mountain Section of
the study area and particularly along Laurel Fork Stream.</p>
<p>	The vegetation of this
phase is characterized by light-demanding, tough-rooted perennials
tolerant of frequent inundation and scouring. Twisted Sedge  (<i>Carex
</i> <i>torta</i>) is the dominant species., forming extensive
colonies. Frequent and locally abundant associates are Silky Willow (<i>Salix  sericea</i>),  Flat-top White Aster, Deer-tongue Grass (
<i>Panicum  clandestinum</i>),  Wrinkle=leaf Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago 
rugosa</i>),  Soft Rush,  Woodland Bulrush, Northern Woolgrass, Field
Horsetail (<i> Equisetum  arvense</i>),  Sensitive Fern   (<i>Onoclea
 sensibilis</i>),  New York Ironweed   (<i>Vernonia  noveboracensis</i>), Virginia Bugleweed  (<i>Lycopus  virginicus</i>)  and Mad-dog
Skullcap. 
</p>
<p>	The next three
Landtype Phases, Herbaceous Old Fields, Shrubby old Fields and
Coniferous Plantations, are of less interest from an ecological
standpoint than the foregoing, and will not be discussed further,
although the occurrence of  Ground Juniper  (<i>Juniperus  communis</i>) in Shrubby Old Fields is of some interest.</p>
<p>	Landtype Phase 15,
Mixed Hardwood Forests of Scarp Slope Hollows, is of considerable
interest through comparison with Landtype Phase 1, Northern Hardwood
Forests of Fertile Slopes and Hollows. It is however restricted to
the study area's Ridge and Valley Section. It occupies numerous
hollow heads on the upper portion of the steep, southeast-facing
scarp. Soils are very stony silt loams, dark, and apparently quite
fertile. They are largely &quot;mesic&quot; with regard to
temperature. This habitat often contains low ledges and outcrops. One
tested sample from this phase was from the head of a hollow at 3760
feet  (1147 m)  elevation. Its soil had a pH of 4.5, with 1471 ppm
calcium and 127 ppm magnesium. Large trees 130-160 years in age  (in
2004)  are quite common in the Phase, although the forest as whole
has been greatly altered by the Chestnut Blight, fire and windthrow.</p>
<p>	The canopy of this
Phase is generally dominated by Sugar Maple, Northern Red Oak and
hickories, among which Pignut  (<i>Carya  glabra </i>) is most
common. However Shagbark  (<i>C.  ovata </i>) and Mockernut (<i> C. 
tomentosa </i>) are also quite common. Also common in lower slopes of
the Phase, particularly in secondary stands, is Tuliptree,  a species
not present in much of the Laurel Fork area because of climatic
restrictions. However, it does not occur in the sample cited above as
a consequence of elevation. Other frequent canopy associates are
Chestnut Oak  (<i>Quercus  prinus</i>),  White Ash, Black Birch and
White Oak  (<i>Quercus  alba</i>). </p>
<p>	Common understory and
shrub species are Striped Maple, Hophornbeam, Witch Hazel, 
Maple-leaf Viburnum  (<i>Viburnum  acerifolium</i>),  Prickly
Gooseberry  (<i>Ribes  cynosbati</i>),  as well as saplings of Sugar
Maple and the hickories. At lower elevations Flowering Dogwood (
<i>Cornus  florida</i>)  and vines such as the grapes  (<i>Vitis</i> 
spp.)  and  Dutchman's Pipe  (<i>Aristolochia  macrophylla</i>)  also
occur.</p>
<p>	Among  herbs, White
Snakeroot  (<i>Eupatorium  rugosum </i>), Black Cohosh and Canada
Brome Grass  (<i>Bromus  purgans</i>) are frequently dominant.
Associates are  Hog Peanut  (<i>Amphicarpa  bracteata</i>), 
Enchanter's Nightshade  (the mesic soil species <i>Circaea </i>
<i>quadrisulcata </i>or <i>C.  canadensis</i> rather than <i>C. 
alpina</i> of frigid soils),  Virginia Waterleaf, Wide-leaf Joe-pie
Weed, Sicklepod  (<i>Arabis  canadensis</i>),  Horse Balm (
<i>Collinsonia </i> <i>canadensis</i>),  Tall Bellflower  (<i>Campanula
 americana</i>),  Basilbalm  (<i>Monarda  clinopodia</i>   rather
than <i>M.  didyma</i> of frigid soils),  Goatsbeard  (<i>Aruncus 
dioicus</i>),  Tall Agrimony  (<i>Agrimonia  gryposepala</i>), 
Three-lobed Violet  (<i>Viola  triloba</i>),  Indian Turnip, Hare
Figwort  (<i>Scrophularia  lanceolata</i>),  Rattlesnake Fern (
<i>Botrichium  virginianum</i>),  Sweet-scented Bedstraw  (<i>Galium 
triflorum</i>),  Wild Licorice   (<i>Galium </i> <i>cicaezans</i>), 
Purple Bedstraw  (<i>Galium  latifolium</i>),  Carolina Vetch  (<i>Vicia
 caroliniana</i>),  Carrion Flower  (<i>Smilax  herbacea</i>), 
Spreading Dogbane  (<i>Apocynum  androsaemifolium</i>),  Oxeye (
<i>Heliopsis  helianthoides</i>),  Cut-leaved Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago
 arguta</i>),  Nodding Fescue  (<i>Festuca  obtusa</i>), 
Slender-flowered  Muhly (<i> Muhlenbergia</i>  <i>tenuiflora</i>), 
Short-leaved Bluegrass  (<i>Poa  cuspidata</i>),  Slender Wild Rye (
<i>Elymus</i>  <i>villosus </i>), Appalachian Sedge  (<i>Carex 
appalachica </i>), Oval-leaved Sedge (<i> Carex  cephalophora</i> ), 
Loose-flowered Sedge<i> </i>(<i> Carex  laxiflora </i>),<i> </i>Smooth
Rockcress<i> </i> (<i>Arabis  laevigata</i>),  Early Meadowrue (
<i>Thalictrum  dioicum </i>), Early Saxifrage  (<i>Saxifraga </i>
<i>virginiensis</i>)  and  Ebony Spleenwort  (<i>Asplenium 
platyneuron</i>). </p>
<p>	According to Fleming
and Moorhead  (1996). </p>

<p>	&quot; The forests of
this phase tend to have a distinctive physiognomy consisting of more
or less regularly spaced, older growth northern red oak amid younger
growth comprised of sugar maple, hickories, and other species. In
many cases, these young cohorts have grown up to fill canopy gaps
created by the death of American chestnut  (<i>Castanea  dentata</i>
). Numerous, slowly rotting, fallen chestnut boles are present
everywhere in this Phase and provide evidence that this species was a
co-dominant tree in many pre-blight stands. Apparently, sugar maple,
hickories, tuliptree, and others were less abundant in the original
forests but were components of a rather rich, mesic, and mixed
American Chestnut-northern red oak community. Scars from at least two
fire events were observed on a number of older, relict trees.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
<p>	As seen in the listing
of species, there is a fundamental difference between this Landtype
Phase and that of Northern Hardwoods of Fertile Slopes and Hollows (
Phase 1),  despite the fertile soils that characterize both Phases.
Although both Phases have many species in common, there are a number
that apparently do not usually cross over.  Examples are Blue Cohosh
and Ramps, the latter in particular,  being a species confined to
rich northern hardwoods, and, as indicated above, frigid soils..
Others include  the different species of  genra such as<i>,</i>
<i>Circaea</i> and <i>Monarda.</i> While some of these differences
are attributable to differences in substrate as related to bedrock,
many reflect differences in soil and air temperatures. Ramps demand
the cooler soils as do also <i>Circaea  alpina</i> and <i>Monarda 
didyma.</i> The same is true of the northern forest Hobblebush as
distinguished from Maple-leaf  Viburnum,  which occurs widely in
warmer soils. In the example of Landtype Phase 15 cited briefly
above, the south-ranging species of <i>Circaea</i> is present rather
than the cool soil demanding <i>Circaea</i>  <i>alpina</i>, despite
an elevation of 3720 feet asl. This indicates that topography and
regional climatic variation may trump elevation. The southeast
aspects and Ridge and Valley position of Landtype Phase 15 engender
warmer soils than many lower valleys of the Allegheny Mountain
region. Although ambient air temperatures may be low at times at the
high elevation sites on the scarp slope, this cold air readily drains
down-slope and cannot accumulate as does that in valley flats.</p>
<p>	Landtype Phase 16
represents the Ericad Forests of North and East Facing Slopes. It is
restricted to the Ridge and Valley Section, which encompasses the
southeast flank  (scarp slope)  of  Middle Mountain. It occupies
north to east-facing sideslopes of the hollows. These habitats are
steeper, cooler and moister than adjacent crests and south-facing
slopes. Soils are mesic and formed in residuum and colluvium from
interbedded sandstones and shales. A tested sample had pH of 4.1,
with 72 ppm calcium and 20 ppm magnesium.</p>
<p>	The canopy is usually
dominated by Northern Red Oak, but Chestnut Oak, Red Maple, Shagbark
Hickory and Black Birch are common associates. Minor associates are
Cucumbertree, which may attain large size, White Oak and White Pine.</p>
<p>	Young Hemlock,
Northern Red Oak and Red Maple are common in the subcanopy, as are 
Hophornbeam. and Mountain Maple, while Witch Hazel, Mountain Holly,
Maple-leaf Viburnum, Mountain Laurel, Upland Low Blueberry and
Mountain Azalea  (<i>Rhododendron </i> <i>roseum</i>)  form shrub
layers.</p>
<p>	While the ground cover
is frequently dominated by tree seedlings, particularly those of
Striped Maple, as a consequence of Deer browsing, steeper slopes may
have a variety of herbs, These include the common occurrence of
Christmas and New York Ferns, Marginal Shield Fern  (<i>Dryopteris 
marginalis</i>),  Intermediate Shield Fern, Indian Cucumber-root, 
Round-leaf Violet and Big-leaf Aster  (<i>Aster  macrophyllus</i>). 
Other less common herbs are Purple Bedstraw  (<i>Galium  latifolium</i>), Curtis Goldenrod, Tall White Lettuce  (<i>Prenanthes  altissima</i>), Slender Wood Sedge  (<i>Carex  digitalis</i>),  Starry Campion (
<i>Silene  stellata</i>),  Lance-leaf Anemone  (<i>Anemone 
quinquefolia</i>  var <i>lanceolata </i>), Calico Aater  (<i>Aster 
lateriflorus</i>),  Bellow-beaked Sedge  (<i>Carex  albicans</i>), 
Canada Mayflower, Partridge Berry, Black Snakeroot  (<i>Sancula 
canadensis</i>),  Great Chickweed  (<i>Stellaria </i> <i>pubera </i>)
and Painted Trillium. 
</p>
<p>	Landtype Phase 17,
Ericad Forests of Medium to High Elevation Slopes, occurs locally
throughout most of the study area, where it is strongly associated
with warm infertile sites. On the Middle Mountain southeast-facing
scarp slope, it is locally common on interfluve ridges at higher
elevations. On the west flank of Middle Mountain it occupies sizable
zones on west to southwest slopes, and west of Laurel Fork Stream, it
becomes restricted to small zones  on south to southwest-facing
steep, incised valley sideslopes. In general the Phase is confined to
north aspects or higher elevations in the Ridge and Valley Section
and to warm aspects or lower elevations in the Allegheny Mountain
Section. Soil samples, consisting of stony silt loams, had an average
pH value of 4.1, with average calcium at 60 ppm and magnesium at 17
ppm.</p>
<p>	The vegetation
consists of variable mixtures of Chestnut Oak and Northern Red Oak,
with moderately to very dense ericaceous undergrowth. The only common
canopy associate is Red Maple, although Bigtooth Aspen and Pitch Pine
 (<i>Pinus  rigida</i>)  are found in many stands. On the Middle
Mountain scarp slope and locally elsewhere, Chestnut Oak usually
dominates and White Oak is frequent. In the Allegheny Mountain
portion, and locally on the Middle Mountain scarp slope, Northern Red
Oak is most abundant, and Black Birch may occur as well.</p>
<p>	Striped Maple is
common as trees and seedlings, and associated small trees and shrubs
include American Chestnut sprouts, Black Gum  (<i>Nyssa  sylvatica</i>), Downy Serviceberry, Sassafras  (<i>Sassafra  albidum</i>),  Bear
Oak  (<i>Quercus  ilicifolia</i>)  and Witch Hazel. In forest types
with Black Birch, Mountain Holly is common and Hemlock saplings may
occur.</p>
<p>	Mountain Laurel is
typically dominant in both the shrub and herb strata. Also common are
Upland Low Blueberry, Early Low Blueberry, Mountain Azalea,
Minnie-bush, and Teaberry. Great Rhododendron, which is almost
confined to the Laurel Fork Valley, occurs anomalously on a steep
west-facing slope along Buck Run as a continuous shrub layer. 
</p>
<p>	Herbs are scarce in
this Phase, But Gay Wings, Four-leaved Yam, Indian Pipe, Wild
Sarsaparilla and Tree Clubmoss have a scattered presence.</p>
<p>	Landtype Phase 18, 
Ericad Forests of Gentle Crests., occurs locally in the eastern half
of the study area., where it is strongly associated with gently
slopes on warm, infertile, high elevation sites on upper portions of
both flanks of Middle Mountain. Soils are deep, stony silt loams. The
following average values of soil elements were obtained: pH= 3.9,
calcium =54 ppm and magnesium = 19 ppm. Charcoal evidence of fire is
common. Scattered trees 130-160 years in age  (in 2004) are common in
many stands.</p>
<p>	This is mixed oak
forest, with White Oak usually co-dominant with Northern Red and
Chestnut Oaks. Red Maple is also common in the canopy, while Black
Birch, Shagbark Hickory and Black Cherry are minor canopy species.</p>
<p>	Components of the
understory and shrub layers are small Hemlock, Striped Maple, 
American Chestnut sprouts, Downy Serviceberry, Sassafras, Witch
Hazel, Minnie-bush,  Upland Low Blueberry, frequently in dense
patches, Early Low Blueberry, Mountain and Pinxter  (<i>Rhododendron 
nudiflorum</i>)  Azaleas and Teaberry.</p>
<p>	Common sedges, where
blueberry cover is thin, are Wood's Sedge  (<i>Carex  woodii </i>)
and Pennsylvania Sedge. Other herbs are Gay Wings,  Autumn Bent
Grass, Whorled Loosestrife, Four-leaved Yam, Indian Pipe,
Arrow-leaved Violet, Plantain-leaved Pusseytoes  (<i>Antennaria 
plantaginifolia</i>),  Blue Wood Aster  (<i>Aster  cordifolius</i>) 
and Lance-leaved Wild Licorice  (<i>Galium  lanceolatum</i>). </p>
<p>	 Landtype 19, Rock
Outcrops and Narrow Clifftop Crests occupies small, local areas in
and near the Laurel Fork Valley and on the upper portion of the
Middle Mountain scarp slope. It is confined to warm, infertile
habitats on and around major rock outcrops, usually with a south or
west aspect. There is little, if any, true soil in these habitats,
and vegetation is supported by  crevices and ledges with deep
accumulations of humus. A humus sample from a plot representative of
this Phase had a pH of 4.4, 60 ppm calcium and 17 ppm magnesium. In
this plot a charcoal-rich duff layer up to 11 cm deep was evidence of
one or more fires.</p>
<p>	The vegetation of this
Phase is characterized by a stunted and gnarled overstory of Chestnut
Oak, Northern Red Oak, Red Maple and rarely White Oak. Small Black
Birch and White Ash are common in crevices. On rasorback  crests and
clifftops,  Mountain Laurel is abundant, and Common Greenbrier forms
large climbing and sprawling colonies. In more open spots of the
clifftops Hay-scented Fern is common. Small shrubs and herbaceous
plants are very scarce in the crest zones dominated by greenbrier,
but shelves, crevices and ledges typically support a number of rock
or crevice-loving species. Examples are Rock Polypody  (<i>Polypodium
 virginianum</i>),  Wild Sarsaparilla, Summer Sedge  (<i>Carex 
aestivalis</i>),  Hay Sedge  (<i>Carex  argyrantha</i>),  Ribbed
Sedge  (<i>Carex  virescens</i>),  Northern Bush Honeysuckle (
<i>Diervilla  lonicera</i>),  Round-leaved Gooseberry  (<i>Ribes 
rotundifolia</i>),  Marginal Shield Fern, American Alumroot (
<i>Heuchera  americana</i>),  Wild Hydrangea  (<i>Hydrangea 
arborescens</i>)  and Downy Many Knees However, the most abundant and
conspicuous plants on these outcrops are often large rock-trype
lichens of the genus <i>Umbilicaria.</i></p>
<p><i>	</i>Of interest
also, is that this Phase provides prime hibernacula for the Forest
Rattlesnake   (<i>Crotalaria  horridus  horridus</i>). </p>
<p>	The final Landtype
Phase,  number 20, is represented by Oak- Ericad Forests of Medium
Elevation, SE to SW- Facing Slopes, and occurs locally in the eastern
half of the study area, where it is strongly associated with warm,
dry, infertile sites, mostly below 3,400 feet  (1,036 m)  elevation.
It is probably the most widely distributed Phase on the southeast
flank of Middle Mountain, and occupies southeast to southwest
sideslopes and interfluve spurs. West of the Middle Mountain summit
it is increasingly localized on more or less south-facing, convex
slopes and rarely occurs west of Laurel Fork Stream. Habitats include
steep areas of bouldery  colluvium and outcrops as well as residual
slopes with well-developed soils. Soil samples from three plots
yielded the following average values: pH = 4.1, calcium = 60 ppm and
magnesium = 16 ppm. 
</p>
<p>	These are dry forests,
typically dominated by Chestnut Oak, in some places, to the exclusion
of all other trees. Black Oak is a characteristic, in some cases
co-dominant tree, and Scarlet Oak  (<i>Quercus  coccinea</i> )  is
important at lower elevations, usually below 3,200 feet  (975 m), 
while Northern Red Oak is generally confined to high elevations.
White Oak, Pignut  and Mockernut Hickories, Red Maple and Pitch Pine
are occasional canopy associates.</p>
<p>	Small tree and shrub
layers include Red Maple, Black Gum, American Chestnut sprouts, Downy
Serviceberry, Sassafras, various oaks and hickories and Witch Hazel.
However ericads such as Mountain Laurel, Upland Low Blueberry, Deer
Berry and Pinxter Azalea tent to dominate both the shrub and
herbaceous strata. Teaberry is generally present and Black
Huckleberry varies from absent to locally abundant. Flowering Dogwood
occurs at lower elevations.</p>
<p>	While herbs are not
common in this community type, they include Whorled Loosestife,
Poverty Oat Grass, Canada Cinquefoil  (<i>Potentilla  canadensis</i>), Four-leaved Yam, Indian Pipe, Purple Bedstraw, Variable Panic
Grass  (<i>Panicum  commutatum</i>),  Small-fruited Panic Grass (
<i>Panicum  </i>dichotomum),  Bracken Fern, Arrow-leaved Violet,
Plantain-leaved Pusseytoes, Panicled Hawkweed, Entire-leaved Yellow
Foxglove  (<i>Aureolaria  laevigata</i>),  Trailing Arbutus,
Rattlesnake Weed, Mountain Bellwort  (<i>Uvularia  pudica</i>), 
Sessil-leaved Bellwort  (<i>Uvularia  sessilifolia</i>),  Prairie
Wedge Grass  (<i>Sphenopholis  obtusata</i>),  Hairy Angelica (
<i>Angelica  venenosa</i>)  and Featherbells  (<i>Stenanthium </i>
<i>gramineum</i>). </p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<ul>
<p>
<p>	The floras of the
Locust Springs / Laurel Fork Area illustrate beautifully their
relations to climate, substrate, topography and not least, regional
climatic variation with respect to physiographic province
characteristics. An interesting point relates to the stability
characteristics  (Mueller, 2000)  of such species as White Ash,
Hispid Greenbrier  (<i>Smilax  hispida </i>or <i>S.  tamnoides  </i>)
and Sharplobe Hepatica  (<i>Hepatica  acutiloba </i>). In lower
elevation, warmer habitats these species appear to be restricted to
more alkaline conditions than are typical of  the Laurel Fork
Landtype Phases. In the previous experience of this reporter, White
Ash seldom, if ever, occurred at pH values lower than 4.0 in all
habitats examined. Examples are the extensive data from the Peters
Mountain Area  (Fleming and Moorhead,  2000)  as well as his own
data. In the Laurel Fork habitats lower values are common, although,
as elsewhere, this species is generally associated with the richer
soils. Examination of Fleming and Moorhead's  (1996)  releve forms
reveals that in the case of White Ash, in 11 out of 19 plots that
contained this species,  pH values chosen as representative were 
less than 4.0, with the lowest at 3.5. Only one plot, at an elevation
of 3320 feet asl, with frigid soils, and a pH of 3.7, contained
Hispid Greenbrier. Sharp-lobe Hepatica was also restricted to a
single plot. In this case the elevation was 3360 feet in northern
hardwood,  also with frigid soils, and had a representative pH of
4.0. We should bear in mind however, that these single value pHs are
not necessarily  from soil equilibrated with the plants in question,
but are from arbitrarily located sites within the plots. Yet the
prevalence of low pH values in plots with White Ash seems to point to
a temperature effect. This conclusion is supported by the absence of
Tuliptree, a species known to be temperature sensitive, and which is
restricted to the lowest elevations of the High Allegheny
Sub-section. The same effect is probably operative in the cases of
Hispid Greenbrier and Sharplobe Hepatica and was in fact suggested
for the former in <a href=reddish.htm>our section on Reddish Knob</a> and elsewhere. Also,
Sharplobe Hepatica occurs in intimate association with such
acidiphiles as Canada Mayflower and Partridge Berry in the <a href=fannier.htm>Fanny
Bennett Hemlock Grove</a> and in the <a href=cranberry.htm>Cranberry Glades Area</a> in stands
which contain Red Spruce and numerous boreal species  (see our
sections on these areas). </p>
