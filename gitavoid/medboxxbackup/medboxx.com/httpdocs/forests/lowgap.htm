<p><b>November, 2001</b><b></b>
<ul>
<p> This documents an inventory of the forest through a
1000 ft (300 meters) change in elevation in the Allegheny Mountain subprovince
at near 39° N latitude. Start of the
inventory is at Low Gap along Route 33 at an elevation of about 2900 ft (880
meters) in Appalachian mixed forest. It
then extends through northern hardwood and spruce montane forest and ends at an
outpost of Northern Red oak  (<i>Quercus 
rubra</i>) forest at Stuart Knob and at about 3900 ft (1190 meters) elevation. Except for isolated trees this forest is
secondary and ranges from young to young- mature in age. In places individual large trees, possibly
dating to the primary forest, are
present. Along this traverse available
moisture and temperature, as related to topographic position, including aspect,
are seen to be an important modifiers of the elevational effect.

<h2>Low Gap and Vicinity</h2>
<b>Source Walk: 7-23-95</b>
<ul>
<p> The area surveyed at Low Gap is a northwest-sloping
hollow which forms a drainage leading to Taylor Run. This steep-sided hollow has numerous seeps, rock outcroppings and
abundant large woody debris, which, with the large, mature trees, provides a
structurally diverse forest interior habitat. 
The canopy is dominated by Sugar and Red Maples (<i>Acer saccharum</i> and<i> A. rubrum</i> 
), White Ash  (<i>Fraxinus 
americana</i> ), Northern Red
Oak, apparently Adelgid-free Canada Hemlock (
<i>Tsuga canadensis</i> ), Yellow and Black Birches (<i> Betula allegheniensis</i> and <i>B.
lenta </i>), Tuliptree  (<i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i> ), 
Cucumber Magnolia (<i> Magnolia acuminata</i> ), American Beech (<i> Fagus 
grandifolia</i> ) and Black
Cherry  (<i>Prunus serotina</i> ) . 
There is also a little American Basswood  (<i>Tilia americana </i>), a few Red Spruce (<i> Picea rubens</i> ) saplings and an undergrowth of Witch
Hazel  (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i> ), Alternate-leaved Dogwood  (<i>Cornus alternifolia </i>), Great Rhododendron 
 (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i> ), Maple-leaf Viburnum  (<i>Viburnum 
acerifolium</i> ) and abundant
Striped Maple (<i> Acer 
pensylvanicum</i> ) .
<p> The herbaceous ground cover in the dryer areas of the
generally moist slope included Beechdrops (<i>Epifagus
virginiana</i>), Partridge Berry (<i> Mitchella 
repens </i>), Wood Betony (<i>Pedicularis canadensis </i>), Northern White Violet (<i>Viola
pallens ) </i>, Round-leaf Violet  (<i>V.
rotundifolia</i> ), White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium rugosum </i>), Foamflower
 (<i>Tiarella cordifolia </i>) , Indian Cucumber-root  (<i>Medeola virginiana</i> ), Canada Mayflower 
 (<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>), Sweet-scented Bedstraw 
(<i>Galium triflorum </i>), 
an unidentified <i>Clintonia</i>, Mountain and White Wood Asters (<i> Aster 
acuminatus</i> and <i>A</i>. <i>divaricatus
</i>), Indian Turnip  (<i>Arisaema 
triphyllum </i>), Enchanter's
Nightshade (<i>Circæa quadrisulcata</i>),
White Avens (<i>Geum canadense</i>), Wild
Ginger (<i>Asarum canadense</i>), White Wood
and Upright Yellow Wood Sorrels (<i>Oxalis montana</i> and<i>O. stricta </i>), Honewort (<i>Cryptotaenia 
canadensis </i>), a species of <i>Prenanthes</i>, the sedges <i>Carex digitalis</i>, <i>C. laxiflora </i>and <i>C.
plantaginea</i>, the grasses <i>Poa alsodes</i>,
Bottle-brush Grass  (<i>Elymus hystix </i>) and <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>
and the Large Round-leaved Orchid (<i>Habenaria orbiculata</i> ) . 
Christmas Fern (<i> Polystichum acrostichoides</i> ) is common, Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium virginianum </i>) 
occurs on large rocks, and Rattlesnake Fern 
(<i> Botrychium virginianum</i> ) and Intermediate Shield
Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i> ), as well as Shining Clubmoss (<i> Lycopodium 
lucidulum </i>), were observed.
<p> Growing in seeps and along small temporary streams
were Fowl Managrass  (<i>Glyceria 
striata </i>), a jewelweed  (<i>Impatiens </i> sp ), Turtlehead  (<i>Chelone glabra</i> 
), and the sedge <i>Carex scabrata</i>.
<p> Fauna noted were abundant Dusky Salamanders (<i>Desmognathus</i> sp.) and Black-throated Green Warblers (<i>Dendroica virens</i>).
<p> The next station inventoried lies somewhat over a
mile (1.6 km) north of Low Gap along Forest Road 146 just west of FR 91, at an
elevation of about 3100 ft. (940 meters). 
The aspect is for the most part south, the forest is young, at least
near the road junction and consists largely of Yellow Birch with a heavy
undergrowth of Great Rhododendron. 
Perhaps 500 ft (150 meters) west of the road junction, along FR 146, the
forest is more mature and diverse with a canopy of Hemlock, Black Cherry,
Cucumber and Fraser  (<i>M</i>. <i>fraseri</i> ) Magnolias, Sugar Maple, Northern Red Oak and Tuliptree, and has
an undergrowth of Striped Maple, Witch Hazel and Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex Montana</i> ) . New York Fern (<i> Thelypteris noveboracensis</i> ) is abundant, but other ground cover is
sparse. In one place the canopy
consists of 40% Tuliptree, 40% Black Cherry, with the rest of Red Maple,
Northern Red Oak, Cucumber Magnolia, Yellow Birch and a little Red Spruce. Undergrowth is Beech and Striped Maple. Ground cover here consisted of Indian
Cucumber-root, Partridge Berry, Roundleaf Violet, Indian Turnip, Indian Pipe
  (<i>Monotropa uniflora</i> ), New York and Cinnamon 
  (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea </i>) Ferns, Ground Pine  (<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme ) </i>, Tree Clubmoss  (<i>L. obscurum </i>) and <i>Carex debilis</i>. Northern Red Oak increases substantially up slope. Although some large trees are present, this
forest is clearly more degraded— probably as a result of overcutting
—&nbsp;than that at Low Gap,as is shown particularly by lack of diversity and
sparse ground cover.

<h2>Bear Heaven Campground and Vicinity</h2>
<p><b>Source Walk: 
7-21-95</b>
<ul>
<p> Bear Heaven Campground lies at approximately 3600 ft.
(1100 meters) asl on a small mountain spur. 
The immediate area of the campground is quite flat but the surrounding
terrain slopes off in all directions. 
The canopy here is essentially northern hardwood and consists of large,
mature Black Cherry, Beech, Northern Red Oak, Sugar and Red Maples and White
Ash, with some trees as large as 3 ft (0.9 meter) dbh. These trees may be 100 years old or
older. Striped Maple is abundant, and
there are scattered Red Spruce in the understory. Although no Tuliptree was seen, a few were reported to be down
slope. There appear to be remains of a
few dead American Chestnut (<i> 
Castaea dentata </i>) and Witch Hazel, Minnie-bush  (<i>Menziesia pilosa </i>) and
Hobblebush (<i> Viburnum alnifolium </i>) form a thin shrub layer. 
Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax
rotundifolia</i>) and Hispid Greenbrier (<i>Smilax
hispida</i>) were the only vines seen. 
Although the forest here is mature with splendid trees, ground cover is
sparse and less diverse than at Low Gap, perhaps as a result of generally
rockier and dryer soil. Species
recorded were Canada Mayflower, White Wood Sorrel, Painted Trillium (<i> Trillium 
undulatum</i> ), Star Flower
  (<i>Trientalis borealis</i> ), a Clintonia (probably <i>C.</i>
<i>borealis</i>), Indian Cucumber-root,
Four-leaved Yam (<i> Dioscorea quaternata </i>), Clearweed (<i> Pilea pumila</i> ) stunted Wood Nettle  (<i>Laportea 
canadensis</i> ), Hay-scented (<i>Dennstaedtia</i> <i>punctilobula</i> ), Cinnamon and Marginal Shield Ferns and
the grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>. The first five plants listed are northern
species usually associated with cool growing conditions.
<p> Many large blocks of a light gray conglomerate are
exposed here and bear a growth of large lush Rock Tripe as well as some Rock Fern on their surfaces. Where flat surfaces of these rocks are near
horizontal, they may also have growths of the sedges <i>Carex debilis</i> or <i>Carex brunnescens</i>, with the latter, a
northern species, in particular forming dense mats. While mosses are not particularly abundant, <i>Leucobryum</i> <i>glucum</i> is
quite common.
<p> Evidence of past forest fires in the form of basal
trunk scars is common. However, the
general absence of widely spaced individuals of multiply-trunked trees seems to
indicate a long return period for these fires.
<p> Although
little time could be devoted to fauna, the calls of the Red-eyed Vireo  (<i>Vireo 
olivaceus</i> ) and Hermit
Thrush (<i> Catharus guttatus</i> ) were noted.

<h2>Bear Heaven to Stuart Knob</h2>
<b>Source Walk: 7-22-95</b>
<ul>
<p> This traverse, which extends along FR-91, ranges
between 3600 ft (1100 meters) and 3900 ft (1200 meters) elevation and includes
roadside as well as forest interior vegetation. In several places the forest was entered for spot inventories. To be most meaningful, species are generally
listed in the order in which they are encountered.
<p> The first section of the traverse, extending from
Bear Heaven to perhaps a mile northwest, is at essentially the same elevation
as Bear Heaven. Species successively
encountered, mostly in addition to those already seen at Bear Heaven, were
Cucumber magnolia, Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel, Honewort, a muhley grass (<i>Muhlenbergia</i> sp.), Smooth Sweet Cicely (
<i>Osmorhiza longistylis </i>), Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Wood Nettle,
Northerm White Violet, Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides
</i>) 
White Baneberry (<i>Actaea pachypoda </i>), White Snakeroot  (<i>Eupatorium</i> <i>rugosum </i>), a species of alien<i>Galinsoga</i>, a species of Jewelweed, Crooked-stem Aster (<i> Aster 
prenanthoides</i>), a species
of the grass <i>Agrostis</i>, Yellow Birch,
Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>), Lady
Fern (<i>Athyrium filix- femina</i>), 
New York Fern, Golden Ragwort (<i> Senecio aureus</i>), Great Rhododendron, Woodland Strawberry (<i>Fragaria 
vesca</i>), Common Horsetail (<i>Equisetum
arvense</i>), Fowl Managrass, Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus</i>), species of<i>Sphagnum</i>, <i>Thuidium</i> (Fern) and <i>Hypnum</i>
mosses, Hemlock, Northern Swamp Buttercup (<i> 
Ranunculus septentrionalis</i>), Mountain Oat Grass  (<i>Danthonia compressa </i>) . At the end of this
section a spot inventory was conducted within the forest, which is youthful and
has a northern aspect. Canopy species
in approximate order of abundance are Yellow Birch, Beech, Sugar and Red
Maples, Red Spruce, Hemlock, Black Cherry, and Fraser Magnolia with undergrowth
of Mountain Holly and Mountain
Laurel  (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>) . Birds noted were
Juncos  (<i>Junco hyemalis</i>) and Chipping Sparrows 
  (<i>Spizella passerina</i>) . Continuing beyond this
point along the road, we successively encountered Partridge Berry, the bulrush <i>Scirpus polyphyllus</i>, Shining Clubmoss, Tree Clubmoss, White Wood and
Mountain Asters, Robin's Plantain  (<i>Erigeron pulchellus </i>), Wrinkled-leaf Goldenrod (<i> Solidago rugosa</i> ), Fringed Loosestrife (<i> Lysimachia 
ciliata </i>), <i>Carex laxiflora</i>, Christmas Fern, Calico Aster  (<i>Aster lateriflorus </i>), Filmy Angelica  (<i>Angelica 
triquinata</i> ) and a single
small Summer Grape  (<i>Vitis aestivalis</i> ) vine were observed. 
Now, at an elevation of perhaps 3700 ft (1130 meters), the forest has an
open canopy with heavy undergrowth of Rhododendron and tree species much as at
the last spot inventory. Here on the
shady south side of the road, under overhanging trees, there is a rich
community of low plants including beautiful Plume Moss (<i>Ptilium crista-castrensis</i>), Tiered Moss (<i>Hylocomium splendens</i>), the leafy liverwort <i>Scapania nemerosus</i>, and on a wet bank, American Water Pennywort
  (<i>Hydrocotyle americana</i> ) and blooming Round-leaf Pyrola (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia</i>).
<p> A little over a mile east of Stuart Knob at perhaps 3700
ft (1130 meters) elevation we successively encountered the small spiny tree,
Devil's Walking Stick (<i>Aralia spinosa</i>),
Wild Rye (<i>Elymus riparius</i>), Panicled
Aster  (<i>Aster simplex </i>), Common Speedwell  (<i>Veronica officinalis</i>), 
White Grass  (<i>Leersia virginica</i>) and the Haircap Moss (<i>Polytrichum
juniperium</i>). Along this section of
the traverse we were serenaded by almost incessant and lively songs of Winter
Wrens  (<i>Troglodytes troglodytes </i>) punctuated by Sthe more ethereal ones of the Hermit Thrush..
<p> We now entered an area, still with a northern aspect,
of essentially montane spruce forest such as is usually found in summit areas
well above 4000 ft (1220 meters) but is here at perhaps 3800 ft (1160
meters). The canopy of this forest is
almost pure Red Spruce, perhaps little more than 30 years old, with minor
Yellow Birch and Hemlock and with an undergrowth of Mountain Maple (<i> Acer 
spicatum </i>), Mountain Holly and Hobblebush. Ground
cover is dominantly mosses, the liverwort <i>Bazzania
trilobata</i>, White Wood Sorrel and Intermediate Shield Fern. These plants also provide a covering, with
Rock Fern, of the many large sandstone blocks present here. There was also a scattering of the mushroom<i>Russula emetica</i>. A little farther on along the road we
encountered the first Mountain Ash  (<i>Sorbus americana</i> ), although this tree was probably undetected in the spruce
forest as well. Also in the general
area we noted Interrupted Fern  (<i>Osmunda claytoniana </i>) and in the road opening a Red Admiral Butterfly (<i>Venessa atalanta</i>).
<p> Not far past the spruce forest there is a patch of
recently cleared but re -grown forest that extends down -slope toward the head
of Condon Run, just beyond the western edge of the Otter Creek Wilderness. Here is more Devil's Walking Stick, a
curious, mostly southern species of the Ginseng Family, that occurs at quite
high elevations in the Appalachians although it does not extend far north. Here it is associated with Red Elderberry  (<i>Sambucus 
pubens</i> ), Painted Trillium (
<i> Trillium undulatum</i> ) and
Drooping Wood Reedgrass (<i>Cinna latifolia</i>), all three northerners, as
well as Deer-tongue Grass (<i> Panicum clandestinum </i>), 
Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>), the sedge <i>Carex intumescens</i>, Sensitive  (<i>Onoclea 
sensibilis</i> ) and Maidenhair
  (<i>Adiantum pedatum </i>) Ferns and a
species of wild current (<i>Rubes</i>
sp.). Curiously also, we find growing
together two species of Enchanters Nightshade, the temperate climate (<i>Circæa quadrisulcata</i> and the circumpolar
species<i>C. alpina</i>, which ranges to
Alaska and beyond, and is usually confined to high elevations.
<p> The road extends along the crest of the ridge leading
to Stuart Knob. The canopy here is
again Northern Hardwood, consisting of Beech (<i> Fagus grandifolia</i> ), Sugar Maple, Black Cherry, Northern Red
Oak and Cucumber Magnolia and with Red Spruce in the understory. Here also we noted the first Smooth
Gooseberry (<i>Ribes rotundifolium</i>), and again, the Large
Round-leaved Orchid (<i>Habenaria orbiculata</i>),
a northern species we already found at Low Gap. Farther along the spruce component increases in the hardwoods and
there is more Mountain Ash. Some of the
Spruce on the south-facing slope are very large, possibly 30 inches (90 cm) in
diameter and seem to be survivors of the primary forest that found sufficient
moisture, perhaps from colluvial springs. 
Witch Hazel is prominent undergrowth, the Bulrush <i>Scirpus cyperinus</i> occurs
along the road, and Northern Red Oak increases in proportion, until at the base
of Stuart Knob, it is the dominant canopy species. Although no attempt was made to ascend Stuart Knob, which rises
perhaps 150 ft (46 meters) above the road, it appears that Northern Red Oak
forest extends to the top, at least on the south slope. It is likely that on
such exposed and relatively dry ridges and peaks Red Spruce was always excluded
from the primary forest, which was dominated by Northern Red Oak.
<p> There is much in this traverse that begs explanation,
although certain features are clear. 
First, the forest type contrasts sharply with those of the Valley and
Ridge at similar elevations and on similar rock types. Northern Red Oak is here the only oak
observed and virtually all species are mesic excluding a few such generalists
as Mountain. Laurel and Common
Speedwell.  While the effect of
elevation is readily apparent, considerable tolerance of temperature range is
implied by the coexistence of temperate and southern species with those more
characteristic of the north and high elevations, a circumstance also noted
elsewhere (see our section on White Top Mountain).
<p> The effect of aspect is well illustrated by the
occurrence of typical young spruce
forest below 3800 ft (1160 meters) elevation only on the north facing
slope. The presence of Red Spruce in
the understory at all elevations traversed seems to indicate that this species
was selectively eliminated by logging and/or fires, was at first unable to
regenerate competitively on sites in which it shared dominance with hardwoods,
and is making a late recovery by virtue of its shade tolerance. If we exclude
the primary forest remnants on the high south-facing slope, on only the north-facing slopes above 3700
ft (1130 meters) was this species able to compete successfully with hardwoods
from the start of forest recovery.
<p> A further point of interest relates to air
movement. Since virtually the entire
forest traversed from just above Low Gap to Stuart Knob lies on slopes or ridge
crests, it is unlikely that cold air accumulation by air drainage plays much of
a role. Consequently we can assume that
the presence of cold climate species—spruce, Mountain Ash. Mountain Holly, White Wood Sorrel, etc. —
results from a pure elevational effect. 
The single exception is the occurrence of some cold-lovers such as Red
Spruce, Canada Mayflower and Large Round-leaved Orchid in the north-sloping
hollow at Low Gap, which may be attributable to a combination of cold air
accumulation and the northern aspect. 
Since all the forests traversed here lie under 4000 ft (1220 meters)
asl, and since they are generally on ridges and uplands, they are not, 
however, as subject to low temperatures as are communities that lie at similar
or even lower elevations in well defined basins surrounded by higher terrain. .
