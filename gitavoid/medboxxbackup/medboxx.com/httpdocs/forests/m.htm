<p><b>Maple Flats</b>
<p><b>Augusta County, Virginia</b>
<h2>January, 2001</h2>
<p> 
<p><b>General</b>
<p> 
<p><span> Maple Flats, more than a topographic feature, is a
complex, multifaceted ecosystem that incorporates elements of Appalachian,
coastal and northern floras and faunas. It consists of a northeast- sloping
plain formed by coalescent alluvial fans or aprons at the base of the dissected
Big Levels plateau. Comprised of a mix of materials ranging from boulders to
silts and muds, these fans are inferred to have been deposited by powerful
braided streams during the last ice age more than 15,000 years ago. Most of the
material brought down by these streams was derived from the resistant Antietam
Quartzite of Big Levels ( Kochel and Simmons,1986 ). At present little or no
sediment deposition is occurring at Maple Flats and the present day streams,
among which are Kennedy Creek and Canada Run in the area of this study, are now
eroding the fans on their way to the South River. Thus Maple Flats consists
essentially of fossil alluvium.
<p><span> The alluvial deposits of Maple Flats are underlain by
carbonates ( limestones and dolomites ) of Cambrian age, which have for
millions of years been subject to dissolution from downward-percolating
solutions of acid rain water that is further acidified by the siliceous rock of
the fans. This process has given rise to dozens of sinkhole ponds that
punctuate the alluvial plain. These ponds range in size from tiny to 800 feet (
244 m ) in largest dimension and in depth from very shallow to over 10 feet (
3m ) in some pond centers. As a consequence of different positions within the
regional subsurface drainage pattern the ponds show considerable variation in
their seasonal cycles of inundation and drying and this, combined with the
resident streams and local seeps, has given rise to a great diversity of
habitats and biota.
<p><span> More than 90 species of vascular plants that are to
some degree disjunct from their normal ranges have been found at Maple Flats (
T. Wieboldt, 1995, personal communication ). Some of these are rare and are
listed in <i>Virginia's</i> <i>Endangered Species </i>( Terwilliger ed.,
1991 ). Included are the pondweed <i>Potamogeton oakesianus</i>, Barratt's sedge (<i>Carex barrattii</i>) ,Variable Sedge (<i>Carex 
polymorpha</i>) , Black-fruited Spikerush (<i>Eleocharis melanocarpa</i>) ,
Robbin's Spikerush (<i>E. robbinsii</i>) , Torrey's Bullrush (<i>Scirpus 
torreyi</i>) , White Buttons (<i>Eriocaulon septangulare</i>) , Swamp Pink (<i>Helonias 
bullata</i>) , Bog Rose (<i>Arthusa bulbosa</i>) and Virginia Sneezeweed (<i>Helenium 
virginicum</i>) . The last-named is a two county endemic. Prominent
among disjunct fauna is the Tiger Salamander (<i>Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum</i>) . Many plants of the area have
been classified in terms of community types by Fleming and VanAlstine ( 1999 )
in a symposium proceedings ,number 13,
of the journal <i>Banisteria</i>. This
number, which should also be consulted for an overview of the fauna and other
aspects of the region and which contains an extensive bibliography of previous
work, is referred to in our text as &quot;B 13&quot; where its nomenclature is
adopted.
<p><span> Although many unusual species occur a Maple Flats,
the area is just as significant with regard to species not found there.
Particularly striking is the small number of canopy tree species, and to a
lesser degree this is true of woody plants in general. Also, many familiar
herbs of adjacent areas of similar elevation and precipitation are missing.
Close examination of the topography, rock base and soils immediately suggests
an answer. The dominantly siliceous quartzite alluvium is poor in nutrients and
this deficiency has, through the years been accentuated by vertical leaching of
the upper horizons. Due to low relief there is no access to colluvial processes
which might enrich these soils, although some enrichment might occur through
horizontal diffusive ( leaf ) transport ( Mueller, MS )
<p><span> The upland forest is continuous with and similar to
that described for Kennedy Creek above Coal Road ( see our section on Kennedy
Creek ). Like the latter, it is dominated by oaks, Black Gum, Pignut (<i>Carya 
glabra</i>) and Mockernut (<i>
C. tomentosa</i>) Hickories , Pitch
Pine and Shortleaf Pine (<i>Pinus echinata</i>) . Red Maple, White Oak, Black
Gum, Pitch Pine and Tuliptree dominate moister areas. Significantly, the upland
is characterized by Scarlet, Black and Chestnut Oaks that are adapted to the
severest conditions. Missing or in very low numbers even in the mesic areas are
basswoods, elms, hackberries, Sugar Maple, Beech, White Ash, Black Cherry,
Shagbark and Bitternut Hickories, Sycamore and even White Pine ( planted but
does not reproduce ). Understory trees
are largely confined to Downy Serviceberry 
(<i>Amelanchier arborea</i>) and Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus florida</i>) , but such species as Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya virginiana</i>) ,
Muscletree (<i>Carpinus caroliniana</i>) and hawthorns (<i>Crataegus</i> sp ) are not found. Similarly, shrubs are virtually confined to
acidiphiles such as Upland low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>) , Dangleberry (<i>Gaylussacia 
frondosa</i>) and other huckleberries, St. Andrew's Cross (<i>Hypericum 
hypericoides</i>) , Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>) ,
Chinquapin (<i>Castanea pumila</i>) , azaleas (<i>Rhododendron</i> spp ) and
Dwarf Spiraea (<i>Spiraea corymbosa</i>) , while other widespread
species such as Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i>) also are missing. Vines are
dominated by the greenbriers , especially the wide-ranging Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax 
rotundifolia</i>) , but the upland forests are characterized also by the
acidiphile Saw brier (<i>S. 
glauca</i>) .
<p><span> Herbs too are similar to those of the upland forest
along upper Kennedy Creek, except that an additional species, Pipsissewa (<i>Chimaphila 
umbellata</i>) , occurs in close association with its congener, Spotted
Wintergreen (<i>C</i>. <i>maculata</i>
).
<p><span> Although soils - if they may be called such - in the
upland forest, consist of little more than white sand or coarse cobble under a
thin mor, trees generally have good form. This is probably in part attributable
to an elevated water table during the growing season, but may also reflect
nutrients from the underlying carbonates brought in contact with the deeper
roots.
<p><span> Introduction to the Maple Flats wetland complex
conveniently begins at the two large artificial ponds ( here referred to as
&quot;false ponds&quot; ) which now desecrate it just north of Coal Road.
Unfortunately construction of these ponds caused considerable disruption of the
local drainage and soils, and along Coal Road probably contributed previously
unavailable nutrients to the system. The false ponds are rimmed by a variety of
vegetation, much of it alien. However natives also occur here.
<p><span> A part of the native wetland complex of Canada Run
lies immediately to the east of the false ponds and extends north along the
Run. While stream banks here are low, they are higher downstream and on other
branches, reflecting the prevalent erosion regime. The swamp forest here is
dominated by Red Maple, with Black Gum, Tuliptree, white Oak and Pitch Pine.
Many of the Pitch Pines - some quite large - are dead, perhaps victims of the
changed drainage, but more likely of the pine beetles. The understory here consists
of Arrow-wood Viburnum (<i>Viburnum dentatum</i>) , Smooth Alder (<i>Alnus 
serrulata</i>) , Winterberry Holly (<i>Ilex verticillata</i>) , Wild Raisin (<i>Viburnum</i> <i>cassinoides </i> ), Possum Haw (<i>V. nudum</i>) , Highbush
Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium corymbosum</i>) . Dangleberry , azalea (<i>Rhododendron</i> sp ) and Red
Chokeberry (<i>Aronia arbutifolia</i>) . Spice Bush (<i>Lindera 
benzoin</i>) , which is usually associated with richer soils, occurs
throughout. Other species, including herbs, are discussed in what follows.
<p><span> In terms of terrain covered in our inventories, Maple
Flats may be divided as follows: 1) upland forest, 2) the constructed false
ponds, 3) the Canada Run swamp to the east of the false ponds, 4)the area
downstream from the false ponds, 5) ponds along the woods road, including Twin
and Spring Ponds and 6) ponds near the 1600 foot ( 488 m ) asl contour.

<p><b>Source Walks: 10-2-93, 10-8-93, and 10-16-93</b>
<p><b><span> </span></b>Our survey of 10-2-93 was in the nature of a
reconnaissance with general observations of the swamp forest in the vicinity of
and east of the false ponds along a branch of Canada Run. The canopy in this
forest is dominated by Red Maple and large, mostly dead Pitch pine. Here for
the first time we noted the uncommon herb <i>Aneilema keisak</i>, a coastal plain species also
found in East Asia. Also seen in the swamp were luxuriant patches of Tree
Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium obscurum</i>) , Arrow-leaf Tearthumb (<i>Polygonum 
sagittatum</i>) and Marsh Purslane (<i>Ludwigia palustris</i>) , while
Small-flowered St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum mutilum</i>) was found on mud flats of the
nearly dry largest false pond. Of particular interest was the abundance of
variously colored Northern Cricket Frogs (<i>Acris crepitans</i>) . Other fauna observed were
an Eastern Ringneck Snake (<i>Diadophis punctatus</i>) and a Great Blue Heron (<i>Ardea</i> 
<i>herodias</i>) fishing in a small
residual pool in the largest false pond. Edging this pond was Black Willow (<i>Salix 
nigra</i>) and abundant Buttonbush (<i>Cephalanthus occidentalis</i>
).
<p><span> Our 10-8-93 survey was also brief, but extended to a
tiny natural sinkhole pond ( Elusive
Pond of B 13 ) immediately north of the largest false pond. Here was an
abundance of the coastal plain shrubs Possum Haw, then laden with ripe and
nearly ripe fruit, and Dangleberry as well as the more widespread Red
Chokeberry and Winterberry Holly , both
also heavy with ripe fruit, Arrowwood Viburnum 
and Spice Bush . Particularly abundant here was Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>) , which
formed dense patches on the pond's south and west sides. A pondweed that
sprawled on mud flats of this little pond may have been <i>Potamogeton oakesianus</i>, but
could not be identified as such. Cricket Frogs appeared to be particularly
common at this pond, which was sited in young and dense swamp forest of
decidedly acid character, with Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria
 procumbens</i>
) in heavy mats of <i>Sphagnum</i>.
<p><span> On 10-16-93 a more detailed inventory was done in the
swamp forest east of the false ponds. Successively noted in a traverse south to
north along Canada Run were Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus</i>) ,
large-flowered Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria integrifolia</i>) , Ground Berry (<i>Rubus 
hispidus</i>) , Cardinal Flower (<i>Lobelia cardinalis</i>) , Honey Mushroom (<i>Armillariella mellea</i>) , Highbush
Blueberry , Possum Haw, Red Chokeberry, Blue-black Chokeberry (<i>Aronia 
prunifolia</i>) , Primrose-leaf Violet (<i>Viola primulifoia</i>) , Wild
Raisin , <i>Carex intumescens</i>,
a Harvester (<i>Feniseca tarquinius</i>) Butterfly, a predator of
scale insects ( Klotz, 1951 ), Small Green Wood Orchid (<i>Habenaria clavellata</i>) ,
Ridged Yellow Flax (<i>Linum striatum</i>) , American Feverfew (<i>Parthenium</i> <i>integrifolium</i>) , <i>Aneilema 
keisak</i>, Winterberry Holly, Bushy Aster (<i>Aster</i> <i>dumosus</i>) , Calico Aster (<i>A. lateriflorus</i>) and Toothed White-topped
Aster (<i>Seriocarpus asteroides</i> or <i>Aster paternus</i>) . In the
vicinity of the small sinkhole pond north of the false ponds we observed
Virginia Chain Fern (<i>Woodwardia virginica</i>) for the first time, while on
the mudflats of the largest false pond the spikerush <i>Eleocharis acicularis</i> formed dense mats in association with
Mermaid Weed (<i>Proserpinaca palustris</i>) , Small-flowered St.
Johns-wort, the panic grass <i>Panicum boscii</i>, Spreading Witch Grass (<i>Panicum dichtomiflorum</i>) and the
&quot;fire weed&quot; <i>Erectites hieracifolium</i>. As usual, an abundance of
Cricket Frogs was manifest, particularly in the vicinity of the small sinkhole
pond.
<p><span> Some additional upland species seen this day were
Stiff Aster (<i>Aster</i> <i>linariifolius
</i>), St. Andrew's Cross (<i>Hypericum hypericoides </i> var <i>multicaule</i>) and Goats Rue (<i>Tephrosia virginiana</i>) ,
<p>&nbsp;
<p><b>Source Walks: 4-23-94, 5-23-94 and 11-6-94 </b>
<p><b><span> </span></b>Our walk of 4-23-94 was a rapid reconnaissance, first
through the swamp east of the false ponds, where we again noted the lush Tree
Clubmoss, Marsh Blue Violet (<i>Viola cuculatta</i>) in bloom, small white
violets, either Northern White (<i>Viola pallens</i>) or Sweet White (<i>V. 
blanda</i>) and Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>) in the fiddlehead stage.
Then in the adjacent upland forest we saw Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia 
sessilifolia</i>) , scattered small Canada Hemlock and Pinxter Azalea (<i>Rhododendron nudiflorum</i>) , also in bloom. Towhee (<i>Papilo erythropthalmus</i>) 
calls were common, and two ducks, likely Wood (<i>Aix sponsa</i>) were flushed
from an unidentified pond with heavy shrub undergrowth. Also observed was the
fairly frequent occurrence of an evergreen, thick-leaved small grape fern that
may, judging by its leaf shape, have been Blunt-lobe Grape Fern (<i>Botrychium 
oneidense</i>) , but more likely was Cut-leaf Grape Fern (<i>B. 
dissectum</i>) . Although there were scattered Gypsy Moth (<i>Lymantria 
dispar</i>) egg masses, the eggs bore small holes, presumably evidence
of a parasite, and thus were not viable. Despite the recent heavy onslaught of
this insect, many oaks seemed to be making a vigorous recovery, although many
too were perishing or lost limbs. As on
previous walks, Cricket Frogs were common.
<p><span> Our walk of 5-23-94 began by flushing a Woodcock (<i>Philohela 
minor</i>) near the pond parking lot on Coal Road ( FR 42 ), just south
of the smallest false pond. Other birds seen and/or heard in the vicinity were
White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>Sitta carolinensis</i>) and Tufted Titmouse (<i>Parus 
bicolor</i>) . Along the shore of the smallest false pond we saw Fox
Grape (<i>Vitis labrusca</i>) , the parent of some domestic grapes , and heard
calls of Green and Bull Frogs (<i>Rana clamitans</i> and <i>R. catesbyiana</i>) . East of
this pond we noted Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex/canadensis</i>) , Common Horsetail (
<i>Equisetum arvense</i>) , Whorled
Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia quadrifolia</i>) , Yellow Stargrass (<i>Hypoxis 
hirsuta</i>) , Mockernut Hickory (<i>Carya tomentosa</i>) , Gypsy Moth eggs and the
song of an unidentified vireo. Also seen was an unidentified ground berry , not
<i>Rubus 
hispidus</i>, but with a dull, dark green leaf. Following this we heard
Yellow-billed Cuckoo (<i>Coccyzus americanus</i>) , Scarlet Tanager (<i>Piranga 
olivacea</i>) and Wood Thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustellina</i>) and saw Royal Fern (<i>Osmunda 
regalis</i>) , Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana</i>) and
Spice Bush.
<p><span> A sinkhole pond ( Willow 3 of B 13 ) immediately west
of the woods road junction , was rimmed by Post and Pin Oaks, Black
Gum,Persimmon, Red Maple and Shortleaf Pine, with undergrowth of huckleberry,
while the pond, then dry, bore Dwarf Upland Willow (<i>Salix</i> <i>tristis</i>) , Wild Indigo (<i>Baptisia tinctoria</i>) , Bracken Fern (<i>Pteridium</i> <i>aquilinum</i>) , a variety
of tall grasses and mosses, including haircap (<i>Polytrichum</i> sp ) and peat (
<i>Sphagnum</i> sp ).
<p>`<span> The next sinkhole pond visited ( Oak 13 of B 13 ) lay just to the east of the left fork
of the woods road . An exciting occurrence here was the sighting of a large
Broadhead Skink (<i>Eumeces laticeps</i>) as it left the water with a
splash and dashed rapidly up a large dead snag that stood in the water. Adding
to the scene was the bright red breeding color of the animal's head. To date
this is the only known sighting of this species in the area.
<p><span> Our last stop of the day was at a pond that consisted
of two parts ( Twin Pond of B 13 ) with these separated by a low isthmus that
was flooded in high water. It lay immediately to the northwest of the
previously discussed pond . Here we observed a flock of Cedar Waxwings (<i>Bombycilla cedrorum</i>) , heard a Wood
Duck and a rich chorus of several species of frogs, not all of which were
identified. Here we also saw our first Maleberry (<i>Lyonia ligustrina</i>) and a Pitch Pine with resin oozing from holes that may
have been made by the Southern Pine Beetle (<i>Dendroctonus frontalis</i>) .



<p><span> Our survey of 11-6-94 was conducted under a near
cloudless sky and unseasonably warm ( ~80 deg. F/ 27 deg. C ) temperatures.
Starting just west of the largest false pond, a traverse was made northwest for
about 600 feet ( 180 m ) along the 1600
ft. contour to the pond a little east of it ( Pond 2 of B 13 ) . Here for the first
time we noted mistletoe (<i>Phoradendron flavescens</i>) on Black Gum and were
struck by the variety of tall grasses ( to be discussed later ) in the pond
bed, which again was dry. We then continued northwest for about 800 feet ( 240
m) to a larger pond ( Pond Deep 17 of B
13 ), which was also dry. Both of these ponds lay on the edge of an old
clearcut. In the upland forest between the two ponds we observed an
unidentified gentian (<i>Gentiana </i> sp ) with closed but faded blossoms, that had
long gone to seed. Mosses in this upland forest appeared to be dominated by one
or more species of <i>Leucobryum</i>, mostly
at tree bases. Noted at the second pond were Highbush Blueberry, extensive <i>Sphagnum</i> that extended from the mud
flats into the bordering forest, a Persimmon tree with tasty fruits and a flock
of Cedar Waxwings.
<p><span> We then traversed a little west of north for perhaps
2000 feet ( 610 m ) to the national forest boundary where we saw a quite large
pond or wetland ( Kennedy Mountain Meadow of B 13 ) that lay just beyond the
boundary. As this wetland lay on private land we did not inspect it, but turned
east toward the largest pond in the entire complex, Spring Pond . 
<p><span> On the way to Spring Pond we encountered a small dry
pond that exhibited a very distinct high water mark on trees within it. Not far
beyond this pond we also had an opportunity, at a fallen tree, to observe the
&quot;soil&quot; to some depth, noting that it consisted of little more than
white sand and cobbles with an inch-thick mor at the surface.
<p><span> Having arrived at Spring Pond, which is some 800 feet
( 244 m ) in greatest dimension and almost full of water even at this dry
season, we noted a canopy along the shore dominated by Red Maple and Black Gum,
many of which had been attacked by Beaver (<i>
Castor canadensis</i>) or showed fire
scars. Also common, particularly along the north shore,were numerous dead or
diseased Pitch Pine. Understory consisted of Highbush Blueberry, Possum Haw,
Maleberry and Smooth Alder . Some Pitch Pine showed evidence of the Southern
Pine Beetle. Moving along the pond's south shore from the west, we encountered
a patch of Large Cranberry at the water's edge, where this plant could benefit
from a favorable mix of light and shade as well as moisture and lower
temperatures. The Cranberry grew in <i>Sphagnum</i>
with a variety of herbs that we will identify later when we report on
inventories done during the growing season. However fruit present at this
season was some of the largest this reporter ever saw.
<p><span> Although Spring Pond at this season had almost open
water, a substantial number of plants were visible and these may have consisted
mostly of Golden Club (<i>Orontium aquaticum</i>) that covers the surface
almost completely during the summer. 
<p><span> Our return to Coal Road, during which we noted a
Red-bellied Woodpecker (<i>Centurus carolinus</i>) , took us past Twin Pond. On
this day the dry surface of the largest of the pair exhibited a very bouldery
shore and bed, and Virginia Sneezeweed was in full bloom on the isthmus between
the two ponds.
<p><span> We then continued to the pond ( Oak 13 of B 13 )
which lies about 500 feet ( 150 m) souteast of Twin Pond and is the one in
which the Broadhead Skink was seen on 5-23-94. This pond too was dry except for
a residue of water in its deepest part. Also observed here was a stand of small
Pin Oak as well as mistletoe on Black gum. 
<p><span> A few scattered small Hemlock and Virginia Juniper
were seen in the adjacent forest.
<p>&nbsp;
<p><b>Source Walks: 4-26-95, 5-7-95 and 7-18-95</b>
<p><b><span> </span></b>Our walk on 4-26-95 was along the woods road west of
the false ponds and extended to Spring Pond. Still near Coal Road we passed
through richer, more mesic forest than is usual for the upland and possibly
under the influence of spoil material related to human activities. Here we saw
the first and only Wild Ginger (<i>Asarum canadense</i>) seen on the Flats, as well
as the alien Beefsteak Plant (<i>Pirilla frutescens</i>) . Farther along, in dry
forest, we again noted St. Andrew's Cross and Pinxter Azalea, then Arrow-leaf
Violet (<i>Viola sagittata</i>) , Dwarf Iris (<i>Iris verna</i>) in bloom, Oat Poverty Grass (<i>Danthonia 
spicata</i>) , Common Speedwell (<i>Veronica officinalis</i>) , the sedge <i>Carex 
artitecta</i>, Cow Wheat (<i>Melampyrum lineare</i>) and Mountain Bellwort (<i>Uvularia 
pudica</i>) , with the latter in full bloom. Numerous butterflies,
including various swallowtails (<i>Papilio</i> sp ) and Spring Azure (<i>Lycaenopsis argiolus pseudargiolus</i>) , while unidentified
woodpeckers and warblers were seen and/or heard. There were no signs of the
Gypsy Moth and oaks were vigorously coming into leaf.
<p><span> At Spring Pond the entire surface was dotted with the
flower spikes of Golden Club, and along the shore, Highbush Blueberry and
Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia pilosa</i>) were leafing out. In one place
a single, partially-submerged plant of Swamp Pink was in bloom. golden Club and
Skunk Cabbage (<i>Symplocarpus foetidus</i>) showed evidense of having
been fed upon, perhaps by Muskrat (<i>
Ondara zibethica</i>) , Beaver or
Deer. Other herbs noted here were Fly Poison (<i>Amianthium muscaetoxicum</i>) ,
Kidney-leaf Grass of Parnassus (<i>Parnassia asarifolia</i>) , Shining Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium 
lucidulum</i>) , Tree Clubmoss and Bracken Fern.
<p><span> Also seen were seedlings of Black Chokeberry ( based
on glaberous leaves ). Yellow Swallowtail Butterflies were present and Canada
Geese (<i>Branta canadensis</i>
) called from the pond.
<p><span> Observed in the upland forest during our return were
Mockernut Hickory, Persimmon and the sedge <i>Carex laxiflora</i>. 
<p><span> On 5-7-95, a sunny but cool day, we again skirted the
east side of the false ponds. Here were Marsh Blue Violet and small white
violets, either Sweet White or Northern White , both in bloom. Spice Bush,
Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>) and the panic grass <i>Panicum 
boscii</i> were also noted, as
was a beautiful Rose-breasted Grossbeak (<i>
Pheucticus ludvicianus</i>) in low
trees. Vireos were heard, and tiny, very warty, gray Northern Cricket Frogs
seen in the stream's vicinity. 
<p><span> Then traversing the upland forest north of the
largest false pond, we saw Cinnamon Fern, Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>) and
a single small Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus</i> sp ), the first and only member of the genus
seen thus far at the Flats. Here also we saw a Black Oak with a swollen base
that may have been a fire scar.
<p><span> Now reaching the woods road west of the false ponds,
we again visited the pond ( Oak 13 ) at which we had seen the Broadhead Skink
on 5-25-94. On this pond's north side, on a mud flat, in association with
haircap moss, we saw the last season's dried remains of a plant that resembled
a pinweed (<i>Lechea </i> sp ). Then on the woods road again, we noted
frequent Common Speedwell , some Wild Vetch (<i>Vicia caroliniana</i>) in
bloom and, in the nearby forest, good examples of spaced fire sprouts of
Chestnut Oak.
<p><span> A brief visit to Twin Pond in passing showed small
berries already formed on Highbush Blueberry there.
<p><span> Arriving next at Spring Pond, we identified Wild
Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis
</i>) for the first time at the Flats. Also seen were witches broom on
serviceberry and a little Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>) and heard a Yellow-billed
Cuckoo call. Then proceeding to the boggy inlet at the Pond's east end, a spot
inventory was done of the vegetation in an area of about 400 square meters.
Tallied species were Red Maple, Black Gum, a little Pitch Pine, Highbush
Blueberry, a Chokeberry of unidentified species, Winterberry Holly, Possum Haw,
a little Mountain Laurel, Cinnamon Fern, a single Royal Fern, very large and
abundant Skunk Cabbage, Swamp Pink, Golden Club, Indian Cucumber-root, abundant
Teaberry, unidentified sedges and a Pink Ladyslipper (<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>) . <i>Sphagnum</i> was abundant throughout.
<p><span> The survey of 7-18-95 consisted of a circuit of the
false ponds followed by a spot inventory of a stand of mature forest that lies
between the pond and woods road parking lots.
<p><span> Identified in the upland forest on the approach to
the swamp east of the false ponds were Indian Tobacco (<i>Lobelia inflata</i>) , an
unidentified species of <i>Clematis</i>,
abundant Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinqefolia</i>) and Summer Grape (<i>Vitis 
aestivalis</i>) . After passing through a stand of Smooth Alder,
Small Green Wood Orchid, Intermediate
Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>
) and a little Boneset (<i>Eupatorium perfoliatum</i>) were seen. Also noted was
a low shrub that by leaf shape, color, veins and teeth, had the appearance of
Low Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier spicata</i>) and farther along, Dotted St. Johns Wort (<i>Hypericum punctatum</i>) ,
Seedbox (<i>Ludwigia</i> <i>alternifolia</i>
), Mountain Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum clavatum</i>) and the calls of Crows (<i>Corvus 
brachyrhynchos</i>) and Scarlet Tanagers. It should be mentioned that
calls of the latter were frequent throughout the traverse. Next seen were
Sensitive Fern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>) , a little Partridge Berry
and, on higher ground, New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris
 noveboracensis</i>) and abundant
seedlings of Sassafras.
<p><span> On the approach to the stream that discharges from
the largest false pond, a lush patch of Royal Fern attracted the eye. This was
followed in the upland forest by the first-noted American Chestnut (<i>Castanea 
dentata</i>) and Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum acerifolium</i>) ,
then by abundant Dangleberry and a cluster - the only seen all day - of Gypsy
Moth eggs. 
<p><span> Seen on the return along the woods road were frequent
Bushy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum dichotomum</i>) , Upland Low Blueberry with
ripe fruit, Saw Brier , Deer Berry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i>) with green fruit and a
morning glory, likely <i>Ipomoea pandurata</i> .
<p><span> Our spot inventory was taken in a stand of mature
mesic forest that lies between the pond and woods road parking lots. The area
is bisected by the inlet stream - a branch of Canada Run - of the smallest
false pond. The canopy consisted of Red Maple, Tuliptree, Black Gum, White,
Scarlet and Black Oaks, a few Pitch Pine, Black Locust and stunted and distorted Black Cherry. Measured
dbh values of some canopy species are as follows. Tuliptree: 23 inches ( 0.58 m
) ,Scarlet Oak: 22 inches ( 0.56 m ) and 24 inches ( o.61 m) and Pitch Pine: 24
inches. The most important understory species here is Flowering Dogwood, but
Downy Serviceberry is also present. Spice Bush is an abundant shrub in moist
areas where Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>) and Allegheny Blackberry (<i>Rubus 
allegheniensis</i>) also occur. Other shrubs that are scattered thinly
are Mountain Laurel, Pinxter Azalea , Arrowwood ,Black Haw (<i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>) and Maple
-leaf (<i>V. acerifolium</i>) Viburnums and the alien Autumn Olive (<i>Elaeagnus 
umbellata </i> ) . On a moist
slope, below the woods road and with a few shrubs extending to the stream,
there is a large patch of Coral Berry (<i>Symphoricarpos orbiculatus</i>) , a species not seen
elsewhere on the Flats, and which here may be related to introduced nutrients.
Common Greenbrier is abundant throughout, and Virginia Creeper, Ground Berry (<i>Rubus hispidus</i>) and
another unidentified ground or dewberry are other vines. There were patches of
New York Fern and, mostly near the stream, Cinnamon, Royal , Christmas (<i>Polytrichum 
acrostichoides</i>) and Intermediate Shield Ferns as well. Other herbs
noted were Tree Clubmoss, Indian Cucumber-root, small patches of Partridge
Berry, abundant <i>Carex intumescens</i>, stunted Sweet-scented
Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>) , Virginia Strawberry (<i>Fragaria 
virginiana</i>) a patch of Downy rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>) , a little <i>Carex baileyi</i>, Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina 
racemosa</i>) , Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia sessilifolia</i>) and
Mountain Bellwort. Abundant in moist areas was the alien Stinging Nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>) and small colonies of
Putty Root (<i>Aplectrum hyemale</i>) . A few Cricket Frogs were seen, but most were doubtless concealed
by the heavy ground cover.

<p><b>Source Walks: 8-24-95, 8-25-95, 8-25-96 and 8-31-96</b>
<p><span> Our walk of 8-24-95 again originated at the pond
parking lot on Coal road. From there we proceeded through the swamp east of the
false ponds to the small pond ( Elusive of B 13 ) north of these ponds. We then
visited several ponds along the woods road and ended our walk at Spring Pond.
<p><span> Before entering the swamp we noted Golden Aster (<i>Chrysopsis 
mariana</i>) , Primrose-leaf Violet, Wild Senstive Plant (<i>Cassia 
nictitans</i>) and Autumn Bent Grass (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>) . On
entering the swamp we saw Virginia Yellow Flax (<i>Linum virginianum</i>) and
Cardinal Flower in full bloom with many swallowtail butterflies (<i>Papilio </i> sp ) in attendance. Within and in close proximity to the stream,
we saw an unidentified quillwort (<i>Isoetes
</i> sp ), Crayfish, minnows and a Green
Frog. Fungi in the vicinity included Red Chantrelle (<i>Cantharellus cinnabarinus</i>) and species of <i>Russula</i> 
and <i>Entoloma</i>. Next seen were <i>Carex</i> 
<i>lurida</i>, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod
(<i>Solidago rugosa</i>) , White Grass (<i>
Leersia virginica</i>) , Cutleaf Grapefern , Large-flowered Skullcap, <i>Carex 
swanii</i>, Common Beggar-ticks (<i>Bidens vulgata</i>) , New York Fern and a single
Black Haw Viburnum. The calls of a Piliated Woodpecker (<i>Dryocopus pileatus</i> ) were heard at intervals. 
<p><span> As we approached the outlet stream for the largest
false pond, we saw a patch of Intermediate Shield Fern, and quite unexpectedly
for this elevation, a few plants of Mountain Aster (<i>Aster acuminatus</i>) . Also
present in the vicinity were Witerberry Holly, Highbush Blueberry, <i>Rubus 
hispidus</i>, Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>) , <i>Sphagnum</i> and <i>Hypnum</i> mosses - 
all under a canopy dominated by Red Maple and Black Gum. The manna grass
<i>Glyceria 
melicaria </i>occurred along the
stream.
<p><span> Continuing through the upland forest, we saw the bush
clover <i>Lespedeza intermedia</i> in bloom and Clasping Milkweed (<i>Asclepias amplexicaulis</i>) , a species characteristic
of dry, sandy soils. Having now reached the woods road west of the false ponds,
we moved north along it to the pond in which we had seen the Broadhead Skink (
Oak ), noting there Small-flowered St. Johns-wort and an unidentified species
of <i>Agrostis</i>.
<p><span> We again now investigated Twin Pond, our approach
being through a dense stand of Dangleberry, which on this occasion was laden
with the sweetest huckleberries we had known. After passing through this
thicket, we came to the isthmus that divides the two ponds and saw there White
Buttons and Virginia Sneezeweed rising above the shallow water and beginning to
bloom. Also noted here for the first time was Button Bush.
<p><span> At Spring Pond we returned to the westernmost patch
of Large Cranberry on the south shore. There we noted that the water level had
dropped about a foot below that of 5-7-95 and that in association with the
Cranberry were Three-way Sedge (<i>Dulichium arundinaceum</i>) , Robbin's Spikerush, the
rush <i>Juncus subcaudatus</i> and
Rattlesnake Mannagrass (<i>Glyceria canadensis</i>) , the last-named a disjunct
northerner. 
<p><span> On 8-25-95 we again returned to Spring Pond, and on
the way saw New Jersey Tea (<i>Ceonothus americanus</i>) for the first time along
the woods road. Then, on the gentle northeast slope that extends to Spring
Pond, we encountered patches of Pipsissewa in association with its congener
Spotted Wintergreen. On this slope, in typical Chestnut Oak forest, we saw both Chinquapin and sprouts of American
Chestnut.
<p><span> A traverse was then made around Spring Pond,
beginning with the west and north shores. Initially, on the west side, we were
attracted by the graceful form and pink - purple blooms of the shrub Water
Loosestrife (<i>Decodon verticillata</i>) . Large ferns were also
abundant with Virginia Chain Fern at the water's edge and Cinnamon Fern behind
this. As we progressed along the north shore - an environment quite unlike that
of the south shore - we saw more Water Loosestrife, and in quite deep water,
tall culms of the coastal grass <i>Panicum</i> <i>hemitomon</i>.
Also included in the relatively lush vegetation here were Fox Grape with large
but unripe fruit, the dodder <i>Cuscuta compacta 
</i>and Groundnut (<i>Apios americana</i>) .






<p><span> After rounding the Pond's east end we encountered a
patchy strand of Large Cranberry not previously observed by us. In one place
amongst the Cranberry there were several Pitcher Plants (<i>Saracenia purpurea</i>) ,
likely variety venosa</i> ,since these
plants were short and broad. It is possible and even likely that they were
planted here. Associated herbs included
Carex folliculata</i>, Cotton Sedge ( Eriophorum virginicum</i>) , a bladderwort (<i>Utricularia </i> sp ) and Marsh St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum virginicum</i> or Triadenum fraseri</i>) . Adjacent moist shady slopes
bore many plants of the orchid Whorled Pogonia (<i>Isotria verticillata</i>) ,
which, in the absence of an inflorescence, closely resembled <i>Medeola</i>. Also seen in moist areas was
Black Choke Berry as distinguished by its blue-black fruits.
<p><span> Our survey of 8-25-96 included a more detailed
inventory of the pond number 2 ( of B 13 ) near the 1600 foot contour as well
as cursory observations of other ponds along the woods road.
<p><span> Early on, along the woods road we noted Bear Oak (<i>Quercus 
ilicifolia</i>) for the first time, then the root-bearing fungus <i>Collybia 
radicata </i> var furfuracea
</i> ( or Xerula furfuracea</i>) , Starved Panic Grass (<i>Panicum </i> depauperatum</i>) ,
Black-seeded Needle Grass ( Stipa avenacea</i>) and Red Fescue (<i>Festuca 
rubra</i>) .
<p><span> The pond
number 2 ( of B 13 ) is bordered by an old clearcut . Now dry, this pond was
notable for the diversity of its grasses and coastal plain herbs. These
included Long-leaved Panic Grass ( Panicum longifolium</i>) , Switch Grass (<i>P. 
virgatum</i>) , P. verrucosum</i> , Yellow Indian Grass (<i>Sorghastrum 
nutans</i>) , Little Bluestem ( Andropogan scoparius</i>) , Hairgrass (<i>Agrostis 
hyemalis</i>) , Bushy Aster, Lance-leaf Violet , the St. Johns-wort <i>Hypericum 
gymnanthum</i>, Meadow Beauty ( Rhexia mariana</i>) in bloom, Marsh Pink (<i>Sabatia 
campanula</i>) , also in bloom, and Wild Indigo. Especially imposing was
the flowering Switch Grass, while Yellow Indian Grass and Little Bluestem were
only coming into bloom.
<p><span> We next visited the pond that lies to the west of the
fork in the woods road ( Willow 3 of B 13 ) and which was first visited on
5-23-94. Our visit here was only long enough to confirm the presence of Dwarf
Willow. A return to this pond a week later would result in a more detailed
inventory.
<p><span> Returning again to the pond southeast of Twin Pond (
Oak ), where we had previously seen the Broadhead Skink, we were greeted by a
striking sight. This consisted of 
numerous frogs, quite large and bright green, and which we took to be
Green Frogs, that were spotted at regular intervals of several meters along the
water's edge. Some adjacent frogs were observed to engage in tussles with each
other, as if in rivalry. On our closer approach all leapt into deeper water
with loud squeeks. Also seen here was a Painted Turtle (<i>Chrysemys picta</i>) , abundant
filimentous spikerush and Sphagnum</i>.
At Twin Pond, as in the previous year, Virginia Sneezeweed and White Buttons
were in bloom. However, the water was lower and the adjacent Dangleberry crop
not nearly as large.
<p>`<span> Terminating our traverse at Spring Pond was uneventful except for observing a
plant of some interest, namely both
staminate and pistillate Devil's Bit ( Chamaelirium luteum</i>) and a caterpillar with a
remarkable resemblance to a leaf in the nearby upland forest.
<p><span> On 8-31-96, a clear, warm and dry day, a return visit
was made to some sites visited the week earlier. The first of these was the
pond number 2 ( of B 13 ) near the 1600 ft. contour . Here three soil samples (
Table 1 ), all from surface layers, were taken as follows: MF1 from the pond
edge near haircap moss, MF2 near a patch of Yellow Indian Grass within the pond
and MF3 near a clump of Long-leaved Panic Grass near the pond's center.
Additional plants identified at this pond were a large bush of Black Haw
Viburnum at the pond's edge and clumps of Carex complanatum</i> in the adjacent forest. Also noted was a slight penetration of
Little Bluestem and Yellow Indian Grass into the ericaceous shrub layer at the
pond's edge. Insects that were conspicuous at this pond were yellow jacket
hornets, red dragonflies and dark swallowtail butterflies.
<p><span> Next visited was the larger pond ( pond Deep 17 of B
13 ), also along the 1600 foot contour, and which had been the object of our
11-6-94 visit. Like the pond of the previous week, this pond was blessed with
rimming frogs that leapt squeeking into deeper water as they were approached.
Birds, likely Wood Ducks , also rose from the water. The only conspicuous
herbaceous vegetation noted consisted of spikerush, some panicum and a few
clumps of White Buttons. A soil sample ( MF4 ) was taken from the water's edge.
The loud drumming of an unidentified woodpecker sounded from the surrounding
woods.
<p><span> A further survey was also done at the pond ( Willow 3
) that lies just west of the fork in the woods road and which was briefly
visited on 5-23-94 and 8-25-96. As previously noted, Dwarf Upland Willow is
conspicuous in this pond's vegetation. Associates were yellow Indian Grass,
Little Bluestem, Saw Brier, Creeping Five-leaf, Wild Indigo, Bushy Aster,
Arrow-leaf Violet, Bracken Fern and the two milkworts <i>Polygala brevifolia</i> and
P. incarnata </i>. In places there was
a deep carpet of mosses, including haircap, and <i>Cladina</i> lichen. Haircap,
other mosses and Cladina</i> were also abundant under huckleberry at the
pond's edge, which is rimmed by Black Gum, Red Maple, Pitch Pine, Post and Pin
Oaks and Highbush Blueberry. Also seen here was a Cricket Frog, although no
standing water was present.
<p><span> A brief return to Twin Pond was greeted by a large
bird, likely a Blue Heron. Particularly impressive along the woods road on our
return was the blaze of Golden Asters.
<p><span> The acid character of all the sinkhole ponds visited
is clearly indicated by the character of their vegetation and this is
substantiated by the pH values and general chemistry exhibited in Table1. The
acidic nature of the water has also been established by direct analysis (
Downey et al</i>, 1999 ) .Of particular
interest is how characteristic prairie species such as Little Bluestem, Yellow
Indian Grass and Switch Grass thrive in this acidic environment. The acidity
also indicates that the movement of water is prevailingly downward and that
artesian springs that might access the underlying carbonates are not active.
<p>&nbsp;
<p><b>Source Walks: 3-28-99, 4-26-99 and 5-9-99</b>
<p><span> This report contains additional observations on
phenology as well as adding a few new species to our tally. Each of the three
surveys extended along the woods road, included adjacent ponds and terminated
at Spring Pond. That of 3-28-99 also included a brief observation of an
irregular forest swamp on the divide between Canada Run and Kennedy Creek,
while those of 4-26-99 and 5-9-99 began with observations in the mesic forest
along Coal Road.
<p><span> Our survey of 3-28-99, on a sunny, pleasant day,
began with a cursory visit to the small forested swamp ( 18 of B 13 ) on the
Canada Run- Kennedy Creek divide. The canopy in this swamp is dominated by Red
Maple and Black Gum with scattered Pitch Pine, while White Oak is restricted to
its slightly elevated edge. Although Mountain Laurel occurs along its edge,
there is little or no undergrowth in the swamp itself. Unidentified species of <i>Sphagnum</i>, <i>Hypnum</i> and other mosses dominate the ground cover.
<p><span> Next, moving along the woods road, we arrived at a
tiny conical pond ( 16 of B 13 ). The pignut <i>Carya glabra</i> occurs with
oaks at the pond edge, where Saw Brier and unidentified species of <i>Dicranum</i> and Polytrichum</i> mosses
also occurred. Cricket Frogs were observed and a Spring Peeper was heard
calling. Mr Don Church, a herpetologist we encountered, was kind enough to
reveal the presence of centimeter-long larvae of the Marbled Salamander (<i>Ambystoma 
opacum</i>) in this pond.
<p><span> As we passed the largest false pond we startled a
flock of perhaps five Wood Ducks and, on a foray to Elusive Pond, observed
abundant Mistletoe on Black Gum o the Pond's southeast side.
<p><span> We then observed Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigaea 
repens</i>) and a Turkey Vulture (
Cathartes aura</i>) on our way to Oak
Pond, where we noted the Eastern Newt, a water scorpion ( Corixidae ) and
numerous Cricket Frogs. Following these we made a brief visit to Twin Pond,
where we saw Mourning Cloak ( Nymphalis antiopa</i>) and unidentified brown and
orange butterflies ,and to Spring Pond where we were greeted by the trumpeting
of Canada Geese. Also noted in the upland forest were a few Adelgid-infected
Hemlock as well as Black Cherry and Black Locust of poor form.
<p><span> Of significance on the 4-26-99 visit was the
observation on the drive in of a single blooming Redbud ( Cercis canadensis ) immediately adjacent to Coal
Road. This tree, which is quite demanding of nutrients, likely depended for
these on road gravel, and its occurrence was in stark and enlightening
exception to the general Maple Flats area ,where the species was not observed
by us.
<p><span> An opportunity was taken to measure the pH of the
branch of Canada Run that feeds the false ponds and which flows through the
tract of mesic forest near Coal Road. To avoid possible contamination by the
road,the sample was taken to the south and upstream from the road. The value
obtained was pH=5.3. Also noted in the vicinity of this tract was abundant
Marsh Blue Violet and Wild Pansy ( Viola rafinesquii</i>) , both in bloom, as well as
numerous Cricket Frogs and droppings of the Cottontail Rabbit (<i>Sylvilagus 
floridanus</i>) .
<p><span> Moving once more along the woods road but still near
Coal Road, we encountered Japanese Honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera japonica</i>) ,
Cleavers ( Galium</i> aperine
</i>) and a large patch of May Apple (
Podophyllum peltatum</i>) , with the
last-named growing out of a heavy mat of oak leaves. It is likely that these
mesic species, as obseved earlier, owe their presence here to nutrients that
resulted from human activities associated with construction of the false ponds.
Faunal sightings here included Ruby-throated Hummingbird (<i>Archilochus colubris</i>) , butterflies and bumblebees
on Autumn olive.
<p><span> A striking sight in the dry ericaceous upland forest
was the abundance of Flowering Dogwood in bloom. Conspicuous along the woods road were scattered <i>Carya 
glabra</i>, Pitch and Shortleaf Pines, including seedlings and saplings,
Creeping Five-leaf ( Potentilla canadensis</i>) , Rattlesnake Weed (<i>Hieracium 
venosum</i>) , Trailing Arbutus, Teaberry, Spotted Wintergreen and a
violet with leaves resembling those of Viola primulifolia ,</i>but with deep purple
flowers.In one place Black Haw Viburnum grew with Mountain Laurel under
Chestnut Oak in a good illustration of the large stability and association
range of this viburnum. Insects in this community included a small black
butterfly and an inch-long grasshopper.<b></b>
<p><b><span> </b>Continuing on to Oak Pond, the now-familiar squeeking
frogs were again present at the water's edge, as were abundant
dragonflies. Of interest also was the
identification as Carya glabra </i> of </i>an impressive 29 inch ( 0.74 m ) dbh tree
that dominates this ponds topographic rim. 
<p><span> Then moving overland from this large pignut toward
Twin Pond, two small Mockernut Hickories, a Black Oak with a prominent fire
scar and an occurrence of Wild Lupine ( Lupinus perennis</i>) were successively noted. In
close association with the Lupine was the alien Hairy Vetch (<i>Vicia 
villosa</i>) , which was in bloom. After listening to Spring Peepers at
Twin Pond, the traverse was terminated at Spring Pond, where Swamp Pink was in
full bloom.
<p><span> Our 5-9-99 visit began with another inventory of the
mesic forest near Coal Road. Bird life was quite varied and common and included
Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Red-eyed Vireo ( Vireo olivaceus</i>) , Great Crested Flycatcher (<i>Myiarchus 
crinitus</i>) , Blue Jay (
Cyanocitta cristata</i>) ,
White-breasted Nuthatch, Red-bellied Woodpecker, as well as small unidentified
birds - likely warblers - in the canopy. Scarlet Tanager calls were heard quite
frequently as well. Other fauna included Red Eft, Red-backed Salamander (<i>Plethodon </i> cinereus</i>) , Dusky
Salamander ( Desmognathus fuscus</i>) and a great number of Cricket
Frogs, especially near the stream. It appeared that the number of salamanders
recorded depended only on the number of of rocks or pieces of woody debris we
were willing to overturn. All in all the impression was of a healthy amphibian
fauna in this tract of mesic forest.
<p><span> Additional plants not previously observed here were
Minnie-bush, Tasslerue ( Trautvetteria caroliniensis</i>) , a single blooming
anemone, either A</i>. quinquefolia </i>or A. lancifolia 
</i>and common aromatically-blooming Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola 
blanda</i>) . Mosses included a species of<i>Atrichum</i> and an
intergrowth of Thuidium delicatulum</i> and a Mnium</i>. The fungus <i>Urnula craterium</i> was found at the base of a fallen Black Oak with very
shallow roots.
<p><span> Also found in an area of dumped spoil that appeared
enriched in nutrients were Sensitive Fern, a single plant of Wild Geranium (<i>Geranium</i> maculatum</i>) and a small
patch of May Apple. 
<p><span> Again on the woods road, we heard the call of an Oven
Bird ( Seiurus</i> aurocapillus</i>
). Near Oak Pond a single small Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>) was noted, as were Towhees and a Wood Duck at Twin
Pond.
<p><span> At Spring Pond Pink Azalea was in full bloom, but
Swamp Pink flowers had faded. Here we observed a Yellow-billed Cuckoo at close
range and heard a Wood Thrush call from a considerable distance. Both Green and
Gray Tree Frogs called along the shore, and we again noticed the great
variation of colors - ranging from bright green to black - of the Cricket
Frogs.
<p>&nbsp;

<p> 
<h1>Interpretation</h1>
<p>&nbsp;
<p><span> Beyond its
unusual character and beauty, Maple Flats is a premier classroom of forest
ecology. It well illustrates the pedagogic importance of extreme or end-point
habitats in the delineation of the condition ranges or stability fields of
species and communities ( Mueller,1998 ). By mapping out these extremes in
terms of environmental factors such as physical, chemical and biologic
variables, the stability ranges of individual species can be determined. The
extreme chemical composition of the siliceous fossil alluvium and the profound
acid leaching this alluvium has been subject to, allow us, to a first
approximation, to combine virtually all major soil nutrients in making
comparisons with other forest types. The deficiencies of nutrients in the soils
of Maple Flats are so great that the position of the area in the multidimensional
space of environmental factors is well separated from that of rich mesic
forests and even from those of common forest types as shown in figure 1. This
is illustrated by the low species number of canopy trees, by the shrub types
and by the wetland-related species. The limited availability of nutrients is also reflected in the restricted
numbers of both species and individuals of mammals ( Reynolds<i>et al</i>, 1999 ) and Reptiles ( Mitchell
and Buhlmann, 1999 ) Plants which occur in both rich mesic forests and here - Black and White Oaks, Red Maple,
Black Gum, Virginia Creeper, Common Greenbrier, to name a few - have very large
stability fields indeed. The impressive assemblage of unusual and disjunct
species is a result of the habitat diversity engendered by the sinkhole ponds
and swamp forests. Thus habitat diversity counters low nutrient availability in
this case. Finally the area wonderfully illustrates why the term &quot;
conservation biology &quot; is inadequate in this and many other cases when the
physico-chemical environment is so much in command. Only &quot; conservation
ecology &quot; is an adequate term in these cases - and I believe, quite
generally.
