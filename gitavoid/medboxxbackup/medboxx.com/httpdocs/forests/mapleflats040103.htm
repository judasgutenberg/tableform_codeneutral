<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
 
<p>Maple
Flats, more than a topographic feature, is a complex, multifaceted
ecosystem that incorporates elements of Appalachian, coastal and
northern floras and faunas. It consists of a northeast- sloping
plain formed by coalescent alluvial fans or aprons at the base of
the dissected Big Levels plateau. Comprised of a mix of materials
ranging from boulders to silts and muds, these fans are inferred to
have been deposited by powerful braided streams during the last ice
age more than 15,000 years ago. Most of the material brought down by
these streams was derived from the resistant Antietam Quartzite of
Big Levels  (Kochel and Simmons,1986).  At present little or no
sediment deposition is occurring at Maple Flats and the present day
streams, among which are Kennedy Creek and Canada Run in the area of
this study, are now eroding the fans on their way to the South
River. Thus Maple Flats consists essentially of fossil alluvium.
<p>The
alluvial deposits of Maple Flats are underlain by carbonates (limestones and dolomites)  of Cambrian age, which have for millions
of years been subject to dissolution from downward-percolating
solutions of acid rain water that is further acidified by the
siliceous rock of the fans. This process has given rise to dozens of
sinkhole ponds that punctuate the alluvial plain. These ponds range
in size from tiny to 800 feet  (244 m)  in largest dimension and in
depth from very shallow to over 10 feet  (3m)  in some pond centers.
As a consequence of different positions within the regional
subsurface drainage pattern the ponds show considerable variation in
their seasonal cycles of inundation and drying and this, combined
with the resident streams and local seeps, has given rise to a great
diversity of habitats and biota.
<p>More
than 90 species of vascular plants that are to some degree disjunct
from their normal ranges have been found at Maple Flats  (T.
Wieboldt, 1995, personal communication).  Some of these are rare and
are listed in <i>Virginia's</i> <i>Endangered Species </i>(Terwilliger ed., 1991).  Included are the pondweed <i>Potamogeton 
oakesianus</i>,  Barratt's sedge  (<i>Carex  barrattii </i>),Variable
Sedge  (<i>Carex  polymorpha</i>),  Black-fruited Spikerush (<i>Eleocharis  melanocarpa</i>),  Robbin's Spikerush  (<i>E. 
robbinsii</i>),  Torrey's Bullrush  (<i>Scirpus  torreyi</i>), 
White Buttons  (<i>Eriocaulon  septangulare</i>),  Swamp Pink (<i>Helonias  bullata </i>), Bog Rose  (<i>Arthusa  bulbosa</i>)  and
Virginia Sneezeweed  (<i>Helenium  virginicum</i>).  The last-named
is a two county endemic. Prominent among disjunct fauna is the Tiger
Salamander  (<i>Ambystoma  tigrinum  tigrinum</i>).  Many plants of
the area have been classified in terms of community types by Fleming
and VanAlstine  (1999)  in a symposium proceedings , number 13, of
the journal <i>Banisteria</i>. This number, which should also be
consulted for an overview of the fauna and other aspects of the
region and which contains an extensive bibliography of previous
work, is referred to in our text as &quot;B 13&quot; where its
nomenclature is adopted.

<p>Although
many unusual species occur a Maple Flats, the area is just as
significant with regard to species not found there. Particularly
striking is the small number of canopy tree species, and to a lesser
degree this is true of woody plants in general. Also, many familiar
herbs of adjacent areas of similar elevation and precipitation are
missing. Close examination of the topography, rock base and soils
immediately suggests an answer. The dominantly siliceous quartzite
alluvium is poor in nutrients and this deficiency has, through the
years been accentuated by vertical leaching of the upper horizons.
Due to low relief there is no access to colluvial processes which
might enrich these soils, although some enrichment might occur
through horizontal diffusive  (leaf)  transport  (Mueller, MS) 
<p>The
upland forest is continuous with and similar to that described for
Kennedy Creek above Coal Road  (see our section on Kennedy Creek). 
Like the latter, it is dominated by oaks, Black Gum  (Nyssa 
sylvatica),  Pignut  (<i>Carya  glabra</i>)  and Mockernut (<i> C. 
tomentosa </i>) Hickories,  Pitch Pine  (<i>Pinus  rigida</i> )  and
Shortleaf Pine  (Pinus <i> echinata </i>). Red Maple  (<i>Acer 
rubrum</i>),  White Oak  (<i>Quercus  alba</i>),  Black Gum, Pitch
Pine and Tuliptree   (<i>Liriodendron  tulipifera</i>)  dominate
moister areas. Significantly, the upland is characterized by
Scarlet, Black and Chestnut Oaks  (<i>Quercus  coccinia,  Q. 
velutina</i> and Q<i>.  prinus </i>) that are adapted to the
severest conditions. Missing or in very low numbers even in the
mesic areas are basswoods  (<i>Tilia </i> spp),  elms  (<i>Ulmus </i>
spp),  hackberries  (<i>Celtis</i>  spp),  Sugar Maple  (<i>Acer 
saccharum</i>),  Beech  (<i>Fagus  grandifolia </i>), White Ash (<i>Fraxinus  americana</i>),  Black Cherry  (<i>Prunus  serotina</i>), Shagbark and Bitternut Hickories  (<i>Carya  ovata</i> and <i>C. 
cordiformis</i>),  Sycamore  (<i>Platanus  occidentalis</i>)  and
even White Pine  (<i>Pinus  strobus</i>)   (planted but does not
reproduce).   Understory trees are largely confined to Downy
Serviceberry   (<i>Amelanchier  arborea</i>)  and Flowering Dogwood 
 (<i>Cornus  florida </i>),  but such species  as Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya  virginiana </i>), Muscletree  (<i>Carpinus  caroliniana </i>)
and hawthorns  (<i>Crataegus</i>   sp)  are not found. Similarly,
shrubs are virtually confined to acidiphiles such as Upland low
Blueberry  (<i>Vaccinium  pallidum</i>),  Dangleberry  (<i>Gaylussacia
 frondosa </i>) and other huckleberries, St. Andrew's Cross (
<i>Hypericum  hypericoides </i>), Mountain Laurel  (<i>Kalmia 
latifolia</i>),  Chinquapin (<i> Castanea  pumila </i>), azaleas (<i>Rhododendron</i>  spp)  and Corymbed Spiraea (<i> Spiraea 
corymbosa </i>), while other widespread species such as Witch Hazel
 (<i>Hamamelis  virginiana </i>) also are missing. Vines are
dominated by the greenbriers,  especially the wide-ranging Common
Greenbrier  (<i>Smilax  rotundifolia </i>), but the upland forests
are characterized also by the acidiphile  Saw brier  (<i>S.  glauca
</i>).
<p>Herbs
too are similar to those of the upland forest along upper Kennedy
Creek, except that an additional species, Pipsissewa  (<i>Chimaphila
 umbellata </i>), occurs in close association with its congener,
Spotted Wintergreen  (<i>C</i>.  <i>maculata</i>). 
<p>Although
soils - if they may be called such - in the upland forest, consist
of little more than white sand or coarse cobble under a thin mor,
trees generally have good form. This is probably in part
attributable to an elevated water table during the growing season,
but may also reflect nutrients from the underlying carbonates
brought in contact with the deeper roots.
<p>Introduction
to the Maple Flats wetland complex conveniently begins at the two
large artificial ponds  (here referred to as &quot;false ponds&quot;) which now desecrate it just north of Coal Road. Unfortunately
construction of these ponds caused considerable disruption of the
local drainage and soils, and along Coal Road probably contributed
previously unavailable nutrients to the system. The false ponds are
rimmed by a variety of vegetation, much of it alien. However natives
also occur here.
<p>A
part of the native wetland complex of Canada Run lies immediately to
the east of the false ponds and extends north along the Run. While
stream banks here are low, they are higher downstream and on other
branches, reflecting the prevalent erosion regime. The swamp forest
here is dominated by Red Maple, with Black Gum, Tuliptree, White Oak
and Pitch Pine. Many of the Pitch Pines - some quite large - are
dead, perhaps victims of the changed drainage, but more likely of 
pine beetles. The understory here consists of Arrow-wood Viburnum (
<i>Viburnum  dentatum</i>),  Smooth Alder  (<i>Alnus  serrulata </i>),
Winterberry Holly  (<i>Ilex  verticillata</i>),  Wild Raisin (
<i>Viburnum</i>   <i>cassinoides </i>),  Possum Haw  (<i>V.  nudum
</i>), Highbush Blueberry  (<i>Vaccinium  corymbosum</i>). 
Dangleberry,    azalea  (<i>Rhododendron</i>  sp)  and Red
Chokeberry  (<i>Aronia  arbutifolia </i>).  Spice Bush  (<i>Lindera 
benzoin</i>),  which is usually associated with richer soils, occurs
throughout. Other species, including herbs, are discussed in what
follows.
<p>In terms
of terrain covered in our inventories, Maple Flats may be divided as
follows: 1) upland forest, 2) the constructed false ponds, 3) the
Canada Run swamp to the east of the false ponds, 4)the area
downstream from the false ponds, 5) ponds along the woods road,
including Twin and Spring Ponds and 6) ponds near the 1600 foot (488 m)  asl contour. 
<p>Also
presented here is the first systematic survey of bryophytes (
exclusive of the Sphagnums)   for Maple Flats known to this
reporter.

Walks: 10-2-93, 10-8-93, and 10-16-93</h2>
<ul>
Our
survey of 10-2-93 was in the nature of a reconnaissance with general
observations of the swamp forest in the vicinity of and east of the
false ponds along a branch of Canada Run. The canopy in this forest
is dominated by Red Maple and large, mostly dead Pitch pine. Here
for the first time we noted the uncommon herb <i>Aneilema  keisak</i>,
a coastal plain species also found in East Asia  (now generally
conceded as being introduced by human agencies).  Also seen in the
swamp were luxuriant patches of Tree Clubmoss  (<i>Lycopodium 
obscurum</i>),  Arrow-leaf Tearthumb (<i> Polygonum  sagittatum </i>)
and Marsh Purslane  (<i>Ludwigia  palustris</i>),  while
Small-flowered St. Johns-wort  (<i>Hypericum  mutilum</i>)  was
found on mud flats of the nearly dry largest false pond. Of
particular interest was the abundance of variously colored Northern
Cricket Frogs  (<i>Acris  crepitans </i>). Other fauna observed were
an Eastern Ringneck Snake  (<i>Diadophis  punctatus</i>)  and a
Great Blue Heron  (<i>Ardea</i>  <i>herodias </i>) fishing in a
small residual pool in the largest false pond. Edging this pond was
Black Willow  (<i>Salix  nigra</i>)  and abundant Buttonbush (<i>Cephalanthus  occidentalis</i>). 
<p>Our
10-8-93 survey was also brief, but extended to a tiny natural
sinkhole pond   (Elusive Pond of B 13)  immediately north of the
largest false pond. Here was an abundance of the coastal plain shrub
Possum Haw, then laden with ripe and nearly ripe fruit, and
Dangleberry, as well as the more widespread Red Chokeberry  and
Winterberry Holly,  both also heavy with ripe fruit, Arrowwood
Viburnum  and Spice Bush.  Particularly abundant here was Common
Greenbrier  (<i>Smilax </i> <i>rotundifolia</i>),  which formed
dense patches on the pond's south and west sides. A pondweed that
sprawled on mud flats of this little pond may have been <i>Potamogeton
 oakesianus</i>, but could not be identified as such. Cricket Frogs
appeared to be particularly common at this pond, which was sited in
young and dense swamp forest of decidedly acid character, with
Teaberry  (<i>Gaultheria </i> <i>procumbens</i>)  in heavy mats of
<i>Sphagnum</i>.
<p>On
10-16-93 a more detailed inventory was done in the swamp forest east
of the false ponds. Successively noted in a traverse south to north
along Canada Run were Northern Bugleweed  (<i>Lycopus  uniflorus </i>),
Large-flowered Skullcap  (<i>Scutellaria  integrifolia</i>),  Ground
Berry  (<i>Rubus  hispidus</i>),  Cardinal Flower  (<i>Lobelia 
cardinalis</i>),  Honey Mushroom  (<i>Armillariella </i> <i>mellea</i>), Highbush Blueberry,  Possum Haw, Red Chokeberry, Blue-black
Chokeberry  (<i>Aronia  prunifolia </i>), Primrose-leaf Violet (<i>
Viola  primulifoia </i>), Wild Raisin,  <i>Carex </i> <i>intumescens</i>,
a Harvester  (<i>Feniseca  tarquinius</i>)  Butterfly, a predator of
scale insects  (Klotz, 1951),  Small Green Wood Orchid  (<i>Habenaria
 clavellata </i>), Ridged Yellow Flax  (<i>Linum  striatum</i>), 
American Feverfew  (<i>Parthenium</i>  <i>integrifolium</i>), 
<i>Aneilema  keisak</i>, Winterberry Holly, Bushy Aster  (<i>Aster</i>
 <i>dumosus</i>),  Calico Aster  (<i>A.  lateriflorus</i>)  and
Toothed White-topped Aster  (<i>Seriocarpus  asteroides</i>  or 
<i>Aster  paternus</i>).  In the vicinity of the small sinkhole pond
north of the false ponds we observed Virginia Chain Fern (
<i>Woodwardia  virginica </i>) for the first time, while on the
mudflats of the largest false pond the spikerush <i>Eleocharis 
acicularis</i>  formed dense mats in association with Mermaid Weed (
<i>Proserpinaca  palustris </i>), Small-flowered St. Johns-wort, the
panic grass <i>Panicum  boscii</i>, Spreading Witch Grass  (<i>Panicum
</i> <i>dichtomiflorum</i>)  and the &quot;fire weed&quot; <i>Erectites
 hieracifolium</i>. As usual, an abundance of Cricket Frogs was
manifest, particularly in the vicinity of the small sinkhole pond.
<p>Some
additional upland species seen this day were Stiff Aster  (<i>Aster</i>
 <i>linariifolius </i>), St. Andrew's Cross  (<i>Hypericum 
hypericoides </i> var  <i>multicaule </i>) and Goats Rue  (<i>Tephrosia
 virginiana </i>),

Walks: 4-23-94, 5-23-94 and 11-6-94 </h2>
<ul>
<p>
Our
walk of 4-23-94 was a rapid reconnaissance, first through the swamp
east of the false ponds, where we again noted the lush Tree
Clubmoss, Marsh Blue Violet (<i> Viola  cuculatta </i>) in bloom,
small white violets, either Northern White  (<i>Viola  pallens </i>)
or Sweet White (<i> V.  blanda</i>)  and Cinnamon Fern  (<i>Osmunda 
cinnamomea</i>)  in the fiddlehead stage. Then in the adjacent
upland forest we saw Sessile-leaved Bellwort  (<i>Uvularia 
sessilifolia </i>), scattered small Canada Hemlock and Pinxter
Azalea  (<i>Rhododendron  nudiflorum</i>),  also in bloom. Towhee (<i>Papilo  erythropthalmus</i>)  calls were common, and two ducks,
likely Wood  (<i>Aix  sponsa </i>) were flushed from an unidentified
pond with heavy shrub undergrowth. Also observed was the fairly
frequent occurrence of an evergreen, thick-leaved small grape fern
that may, judging by its leaf shape, have been Blunt-lobe Grape Fern
(<i> Botrychium  oneidense </i>), but more likely was Cut-leaf Grape
Fern  (<i>B.  dissectum</i>).  Although there were scattered Gypsy
Moth  (<i>Lymantria  dispar</i>)  egg masses, the eggs bore small
holes, presumably evidence of a parasite, and thus were not viable.
Despite the recent heavy onslaught of this insect, many oaks seemed
to be making a vigorous recovery, although many too were perishing
or lost  limbs. As on previous walks, Cricket Frogs were common.
<p>Our
walk of 5-23-94 began by flushing a Woodcock (<i>Philohela  minor</i>) near the pond parking lot on Coal Road (FR 42), just south of
the smallest false pond. Other birds seen and/or heard in the
vicinity were White-breasted Nuthatch  (<i>Sitta  carolinensis</i>) 
and Tufted Titmouse (<i> Parus  bicolor</i>).  Along the shore of
the smallest false pond we saw Fox Grape  (<i>Vitis  labrusca </i>),
the parent of some domestic grapes,  and heard calls of Green and
Bull Frogs  (<i>Rana  clamitans</i>  and  <i>R.  catesbyiana </i>).
East of this pond we noted Creeping Five-leaf  (<i>Potentilla 
simplex/canadensis </i>)  (in later inventories to be identified as
to species by floral characteristics),  Common Horsetail  (<i>Equisetum
</i> <i>arvense </i>), Whorled Loosestrife (<i> Lysimachia 
quadrifolia </i>), Yellow Stargrass  (<i>Hypoxis  hirsuta </i>),
Mockernut Hickory, Gypsy Moth eggs and the song of an unidentified
vireo. Also seen was an unidentified ground berry,  not <i>Rubus 
hispidus</i>, but with a dull, dark green leaf. Following this we
heard Yellow-billed Cuckoo  (<i>Coccyzus  americanus </i>), Scarlet
Tanager  (<i>Piranga  olivacea</i>)  and Wood Thrush  (<i>Hylocichla
 mustellina </i>) and saw Royal Fern  (<i>Osmunda  regalis</i>), 
Indian Cucumber-root  (<i>Medeola  virginiana </i>) and Spice Bush.
<p>A
sinkhole pond  (Willow 3 of B 13)  immediately west of the woods
road junction,  was rimmed by Post and Pin Oaks  (<i>Quercus 
palustris</i>),  Black Gum, Persimmon   (<i>Quercus  stellata</i>), Red Maple and Shortleaf Pine, with undergrowth of huckleberry,
while the pond, then dry, bore Dwarf Upland Willow  (<i>Salix</i> 
<i>tristis</i>),  Wild Indigo  (<i>Baptisia  tinctoria </i>),
Bracken Fern  (<i>Pteridium</i>  <i>aquilinum</i>),  a variety of
tall grasses and mosses, including haircap  (<i>Polytrichum</i>  sp) and peat  (<i>Sphagnum</i>  sp). 
`The
next sinkhole pond visited  (Oak 13 of  B 13)  lay just to the east
of the left fork of the woods road.  An exciting occurrence here was
the sighting of a large Broadhead Skink  (<i>Eumeces  laticeps </i>)
as it left the water with a splash and dashed rapidly up a large
dead snag that stood in the water. Adding to the scene was the
bright red breeding color of the animal's head. To date this is the
only sighting of this species in the area that this reporter is
aware of.
<p>Our
last stop of the day was at a pond that consisted of two parts (
Twin Pond of B 13)  with these separated by a low isthmus that was
flooded in high water. It lies immediately to the northwest of the
previously discussed pond.  Here we observed a flock of Cedar
Waxwings  (<i>Bombycilla </i> <i>cedrorum</i>),  heard a Wood Duck
and a rich chorus of several species of frogs, not all of which were
identified. Here we also saw our first Maleberry  (<i>Lyonia </i>
<i>ligustrina </i>) and a Pitch Pine with resin oozing from holes
that may have been made by the Southern Pine Beetle  (<i>Dendroctonus
 frontalis </i>).

<p>
<p>Our
survey of 11-6-94 was conducted under a near cloudless sky and
unseasonably warm  (~80 deg. F/ 27 deg. C)  temperatures. Starting
just west of the largest false pond, a traverse was made northwest
for about  600 feet  (180 m)  along the 1600 ft. contour to the pond
a little east of it  (Pond 2 of B 13) .  Here for the first time we
noted mistletoe  (<i>Phoradendron  flavescens</i>)  on Black Gum and
were struck by the variety of tall grasses  (to be discussed later) 
in the pond bed, which again was dry. We then continued northwest
for about 800 feet  (240 m) to a larger pond   (Pond Deep 17 of B 13
), which was also dry. Both of these ponds lay on the edge of an old
clearcut. In the upland forest between the two ponds we observed an
unidentified gentian  (<i>Gentiana </i> sp)  with closed but faded
blossoms, that had long gone to seed. Mosses in this upland forest
appeared to be dominated by one or more species of <i>Leucobryum</i>,
mostly at tree bases. Noted at the second pond were Highbush
Blueberry, extensive <i>Sphagnum</i> that extended from the mud
flats into the bordering forest, a Persimmon tree with tasty fruits
and a flock of Cedar Waxwings.
<p>We then
traversed a little west of north for perhaps 2000 feet  (610 m)  to
the national forest boundary where we saw a quite large pond or
wetland  (Kennedy Mountain Meadow of B 13)  that lay just beyond the
boundary. As this wetland lay on private land we did not inspect it,
but turned east toward the largest pond in the entire complex,
Spring Pond.  
<p>On
the way to Spring Pond we encountered a small dry pond that
exhibited a very distinct high water mark on trees within it. Not
far beyond this pond we also had an opportunity, at a fallen tree,
to observe the &quot;soil&quot; to some depth, noting that it
consisted of little more than white sand and cobbles with an
inch-thick mor layer at the surface.
<p>Having
arrived at Spring Pond, which is some 800 feet  (244 m)  in greatest
dimension and almost full of water even at this dry season, we noted
a canopy along the shore dominated by Red Maple and Black Gum, many
of which had been attacked by Beaver (<i> Castor  canadensis </i>)
or showed fire scars. Also common, particularly along the north
shore,were numerous dead or diseased Pitch Pine. Understory
consisted of Highbush Blueberry, Possum Haw, Maleberry and Smooth
Alder.  Some Pitch Pine showed evidence of the Southern Pine Beetle.
Moving along the pond's south shore from the west, we encountered a
patch of Large Cranberry  (<i>Vaccinium  macrocarpon</i>)  at the
water's edge, where this plant could benefit from a favorable mix of
light and shade as well as moisture and lower temperatures. The
Cranberry grew in <i>Sphagnum</i> with a variety of herbs that we
will identify later when we report on inventories done during the
growing season. However fruit present at this season was some of the
largest this reporter ever saw.
<p>Although
Spring Pond at this season had almost open water, a substantial
number of plants were visible and these may have consisted mostly of
Golden Club  (<i>Orontium  aquaticum </i>) that covers the surface
almost completely during the summer. 
<p>Our
return to Coal Road, during which we noted a Red-bellied Woodpecker
 (<i>Centurus  carolinus </i>), took us past Twin Pond. On this day
the dry surface of the largest of the pair exhibited a very bouldery
shore and bed, and Virginia Sneezeweed was in full bloom on the
isthmus between the two ponds. Also of interest is the apparent
bleaching of the surface of the boulders and cobbles, which may
signal acid leaching of iron or other oxides when exposed near the
surface.
<p>We then
continued to the pond  (Oak 13 of B 13)  which lies about 500 feet (150 m) southeast of Twin Pond and is the one in which the Broadhead
Skink was seen on 5-23-94. This pond too was dry except for a
residue of water in its deepest part. Also observed here was a stand
of small Pin Oak as well as mistletoe on Black gum. 
<p>A
few scattered small Canada Hemlock  (<i>Tsuga  canadensis</i>)  and
Virginia Juniper  (<i>Juniperus  virginiana</i>)  were seen in the
adjacent forest.

Walks: 4-26-95, 5-7-95 and 7-18-95</h2>
<ul>
<p>
Our
walk on 4-26-95 was along the woods road west of the false ponds and
extended to Spring Pond. Still near Coal Road we passed through
richer, more mesic forest than is usual for the upland and possibly
under the influence of spoil material related to human activities.
Here we saw the first and only Wild Ginger  (<i>Asarum  canadense</i>) seen on the Flats, as well as the alien Beefsteak Plant  (<i>Pirilla
 frutescens </i>). Farther along, in dry forest, we again noted St.
Andrew's Cross and Pinxter Azalea, then Arrow-leaf Violet  (<i>Viola
 sagittata </i>), Dwarf Iris  (<i>Iris  verna</i>)  in bloom, 
Poverty Oat Grass  (<i>Danthonia  spicata </i>), Common Speedwell (<i>Veronica  officinalis </i>), the sedge <i>Carex  artitecta</i>,
Cow Wheat  (<i>Melampyrum  lineare</i>)  and Mountain Bellwort (<i>
Uvularia  pudica </i>), with the latter in full bloom. Numerous
butterflies, including various swallowtails  (<i>Papilio</i>  sp) 
and Spring Azure (<i> Lycaenopsis  argiolus  pseudargiolus</i>), 
while unidentified woodpeckers and warblers were seen and/or heard.
There were no signs of the Gypsy Moth and oaks were vigorously
coming into leaf.
<p>At
Spring Pond the entire surface was dotted with the flower spikes of
Golden Club, and along the shore, Highbush Blueberry and Minnie-bush
 (<i>Menziesia  pilosa </i>) were leafing out. In one place a
single, partially-submerged plant of Swamp Pink was in bloom. Golden
Club and Skunk Cabbage  (<i>Symplocarpus  foetidus</i>)  showed
evidense of having been fed upon, perhaps by Muskrat (<i> Ondara 
zibethica</i>) ,  Beaver or Deer. Other herbs noted here were Fly
Poison  (<i>Amianthium  muscaetoxicum</i>),  Kidney-leaf Grass of
Parnassus  (<i>Parnassia  asarifolia</i>),  Shining Clubmoss (
<i>Lycopodium  lucidulum </i>), Tree Clubmoss and Bracken Fern.
<p>Also
seen were seedlings of Black Chokeberry  (based on glaberous leaves). Yellow Swallowtail Butterflies were present and Canada Geese (<i>Branta </i> <i>canadensis</i>)  called from the pond.
<p>Observed
in the upland forest during our return were Mockernut Hickory,
Persimmon (<i> Diospyros  virginiana</i>)  and the sedge <i>Carex 
laxiflora</i>. 
<p>On
5-7-95, a sunny but cool day, we again skirted the east side of the
false ponds. Here were Marsh Blue Violet and small white violets,
either Sweet White or Northern White,  both in bloom. Spice Bush,
Hay-scented Fern  (<i>Dennstaedtia  punctilobula</i>)  and the panic
grass <i>Panicum  boscii</i>  were also noted, as was a beautiful
Rose-breasted Grossbeak (<i> Pheucticus  ludvicianus</i>)  in low
trees. Vireos were heard, and tiny, very warty, gray Northern
Cricket Frogs seen in the stream's vicinity.  
<p>Then
traversing the upland forest north of the largest false pond, we saw
Cinnamon Fern, Four-leaved Yam (<i> Dioscorea  quaternata </i>) and
a single small Hawthorn  (<i>Crataegus</i>  sp),  the first and only
member of the genus seen thus far at the Flats. Here also we saw a
Black Oak with a swollen base that may have been a fire scar.
<p>Now
reaching the woods road west of the false ponds, we again visited
the pond  (Oak 13)  at which we had seen the Broadhead Skink on
5-25-94. On this pond's north side, on a mud flat, in association
with haircap moss, we saw the last season's dried remains of a plant
that resembled a pinweed  (<i>Lechea </i> sp).  Then on the woods
road again, we noted frequent Common Speedwell,  some Wild Vetch (
<i>Vicia  caroliniana </i>) in bloom and, in the nearby forest, good
examples of spaced fire sprouts of Chestnut Oak.A brief visit to
Twin Pond in passing showed small berries already formed on Highbush
Blueberry there.
<p>Arriving
next at Spring Pond, we identified Wild Sarsaparilla  (<i>Aralia </i>
<i>nudicaulis </i>) for the first time at the Flats. Also seen were
witches broom on serviceberry and a little Partridge Berry (
<i>Mitchella  repens</i>)  and heard a Yellow-billed Cuckoo call.
Then proceeding to the boggy inlet at the Pond's east end, a spot
inventory was done of the vegetation in an area of about 400 square
meters. Tallied species were Red Maple, Black Gum, a little Pitch
Pine, Highbush Blueberry, a Chokeberry of unidentified species,
Winterberry Holly, Possum Haw, a little Mountain Laurel, Cinnamon
Fern, a single Royal Fern, very large and abundant Skunk Cabbage,
Swamp Pink, Golden Club, Indian Cucumber-root, abundant Teaberry,
unidentified sedges and a Pink Ladyslipper  (<i>Cypripedium  acaule</i>
). <i>Sphagnum</i> was abundant throughout.
<p>The
survey of 7-18-95 consisted of a circuit of the false ponds followed
by a spot inventory of a stand of mature forest that lies between
the pond and woods road parking lots.
<p>Identified
in the upland forest on the approach to the swamp east of the false
ponds were Indian Tobacco  (<i>Lobelia  inflata </i>), an
unidentified species of <i>Clematis</i>, abundant Virginia Creeper (
<i>Parthenocissus  quinqefolia </i>) and Summer Grape (<i> Vitis 
aestivalis</i>).  After passing through a stand of Smooth Alder,
Small  Green Wood Orchid, Intermediate Shield Fern (<i> Dryopteris </i>
<i>intermedia</i>)  and a little Boneset  (<i>Eupatorium 
perfoliatum</i>)  were seen. Also noted was a low shrub that by leaf
shape, color, veins and teeth, had the appearance of Low
Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier  spicata</i>)  and farther along, 
Dotted St. Johns Wort  (<i>Hypericum  punctatum</i>),  Seedbox (<i>Ludwigia</i>  <i>alternifolia</i>),  Mountain Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum  clavatum</i>)  and the calls of Crows (<i> Corvus 
brachyrhynchos</i>)  and Scarlet Tanagers. It should be mentioned
that calls of the latter were frequent throughout the traverse. Next
seen were Sensitive Fern  (<i>Onoclea  sensibilis </i>), a little
Partridge Berry and, on higher ground, New York Fern  (<i>Thelypteris
 noveboracensis</i>)  and abundant seedlings of Sassafras  (<i>Sassafra
 albidum</i>). 
<p>On
the approach to the stream that discharges from the largest false
pond, a lush patch of Royal Fern attracted the eye. This was
followed in the upland forest by the first-noted American Chestnut (<i>
Castanea  dentata </i>) and Maple-leaf Viburnum  (<i>Viburnum 
acerifolium </i>), then by abundant Dangleberry and a cluster - the
only seen all day - of Gypsy Moth eggs.
<p>Seen
on the return along the woods road were frequent Bushy Panic Grass (
<i>Panicum  dichotomum </i>), Upland Low Blueberry with ripe fruit,
Saw Brier,  Deer Berry  (<i>Vaccinium  stamineum</i>)  with green
fruit and a morning glory, likely <i>Ipomoea  pandurata</i>. 
<p>Our
spot inventory was taken in a stand of mature mesic forest that lies
between the pond and woods road parking lots. The area is bisected
by the steep - banked inlet stream - a branch of Canada Run - of the
smallest false pond. The canopy consisted of Red Maple, Tuliptree,
Black Gum, White, Scarlet and Black Oaks, a few Pitch Pine, Black
Locust and  stunted and distorted Black Cherry. Measured dbh values
of some canopy species are as follows. Tuliptree: 23 inches  (0.58 m
), Scarlet Oak: 22 inches  (0.56 m)  and 24 inches  (o.61 m) and
Pitch Pine: 24 inches. The most important understory species here is
Flowering Dogwood, but Downy Serviceberry is also present. Spice
Bush is an abundant shrub in moist areas where Black Elderberry (
<i>Sambucus  canadensis</i>)  and Allegheny Blackberry  (<i>Rubus 
allegheniensis </i>) also occur. Other shrubs that are scattered
thinly are Mountain Laurel, Pinxter Azalea,  Arrowwood, Black Haw (<i>
Viburnum </i> <i>prunifolium</i>)  and Maple -leaf Viburnums and the
alien Autumn Olive  (<i>Elaeagnus  umbellata </i>) .  On a moist
slope, below the woods road and with a few shrubs extending to the
stream, there is a large patch of Coral Berry  (<i>Symphoricarpos 
orbiculatus </i>), a species not seen elsewhere on the Flats, and
which here may be related to introduced nutrients. Common Greenbrier
is abundant throughout, and Virginia Creeper,  Ground Berry  (<i>Rubus
 hispidus</i>)  and another unidentified ground or dewberry are
other vines. There were patches of New York Fern and, mostly near
the stream, Cinnamon, Royal,  Christmas  (<i>Polytrichum 
acrostichoides </i>) and Intermediate Shield Ferns as well. Other
herbs noted were Tree Clubmoss, Indian Cucumber-root, small patches
of Partridge Berry, abundant <i>Carex  intumescens</i>, stunted
Sweet-scented Bedstraw  (<i>Galium  triflorum</i>),  Virginia
Strawberry  (<i>Fragaria  virginiana </i>) a patch of Downy
rattlesnake Plantain  (<i>Goodyera </i> <i>pubescens </i>), a little
<i>Carex baileyi</i>, Plume Lily (<i> Smilacina  racemosa</i>) , 
Sessile-leaved Bellwort  (<i>Uvularia  sessilifolia</i>)  and
Mountain Bellwort. Abundant in moist areas was the alien Stinging
Nettle  (<i>Urtica dioica</i>)  and small colonies of Putty Root (<i>Aplectrum  hyemale </i>).  A few Cricket Frogs were seen, but
most were doubtless concealed by the heavy ground cover.

Walks: 8-24-95, 8-25-95, 8-25-96 and 8-31-96</h2>
<ul>
<p>Our walk
of 8-24-95 again originated at the pond parking lot on Coal road.
From there we proceeded through the swamp east of the false ponds to
the small pond  (Elusive of B 13)  north of these ponds. We then
visited several ponds along the woods road and ended our walk at
Spring Pond.
<p>Before
entering the swamp we noted Golden Aster  (<i>Chrysopsis  mariana </i>),
Primrose-leaf Violet, Wild Senstive Plant  (<i>Cassia  nictitans </i>)
and Autumn Bent Grass  (<i>Agrostis  perennans </i>). On entering
the swamp we saw Virginia Yellow Flax  (<i>Linum  virginianum</i>) 
and Cardinal Flower in full bloom with many swallowtail butterflies
 (<i>Papilio </i> sp)  in attendance. Within, and in close proximity
to the stream, we saw an unidentified quillwort  (<i>Isoetes </i> sp), Crayfish, minnows and a Green Frog. Fungi in the vicinity
included Red Chantrelle  (<i>Cantharellus </i> <i>cinnabarinus </i>)
and species of <i>Russula</i>  and <i>Entoloma</i>. Next seen were
<i>Carex</i>  <i>lurida</i>, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago 
rugosa</i>),  White Grass (<i> Leersia </i> <i>virginica</i>), 
Cutleaf Grapefern,  Large-flowered Skullcap, <i>Carex  swanii</i>,
Common Beggar-ticks  (<i>Bidens  vulgata </i>), New York Fern and a
single Black Haw Viburnum. The calls of a Piliated Woodpecker (<i>
Dryocopus  pileatus</i> )  were heard at intervals. 
<p>As
we approached the outlet stream for the largest false pond, we saw a
patch of Intermediate Shield Fern, and quite unexpectedly for this
elevation, a few plants of Mountain Aster  (<i>Aster  acuminatus</i>), perhaps indicating accumulation of subsiding cold air from the
mountains. Also present in the vicinity were Witerberry Holly,
Highbush Blueberry, <i>Rubus  hispidus</i>, Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium  delicatulum </i>), <i>Sphagnum</i> and <i>Hypnum</i> 
mosses -  all under a canopy dominated by Red Maple and Black Gum.
The manna grass <i>Glyceria  melicaria  </i>occurred along the
stream.
<p>Continuing
through the upland forest, we saw the bush clover <i>Lespedeza 
intermedia</i>  in bloom and Clasping Milkweed  (<i>Asclepias </i>
<i>amplexicaulis</i>),  a species characteristic of dry, sandy
soils. Having now reached the woods road west of the false ponds, we
moved north along it to the pond in which we had seen the Broadhead
Skink  (Oak),  noting there Small-flowered St. Johns-wort and an
unidentified species of <i>Agrostis</i>.
<p>We again
now investigated Twin Pond, our approach being through a dense stand
of Dangleberry, which on this occasion was laden with the sweetest
huckleberries we had known. After passing through this thicket, we
came to the isthmus that divides the two ponds and saw there White
Buttons and Virginia Sneezeweed rising above the shallow water and
beginning to bloom. Also noted here for the first time was Button
Bush.
<p>At
Spring Pond we returned to the westernmost patch of Large Cranberry
on the south shore. There we noted that the water level had dropped
about a foot below that of 5-7-95 and that in association with the
Cranberry were Three-way Sedge  (<i>Dulichium  arundinaceum </i>),
Robbin's Spikerush, the rush <i>Juncus  subcaudatus</i>  and
Rattlesnake Mannagrass  (<i>Glyceria  canadensis</i>),  the
last-named a disjunct northerner. 
<p>On
8-25-95 we again returned to Spring Pond, and on the way saw New
Jersey Tea  (<i>Ceonothus  americanus</i>)  for the first time along
the woods road. Then, on the gentle northeast slope that extends to
Spring Pond, we encountered patches of Pipsissewa in association
with its congener Spotted Wintergreen. On this slope, in typical
Chestnut Oak forest, we  saw both Chinquapin and sprouts of American
Chestnut.
<p>A
traverse was then made around Spring Pond, beginning with the west
and north shores. Initially, on the west side, we were attracted by
the graceful form and pink - purple blooms of the shrub Water
Loosestrife  (<i>Decodon  verticillata </i>). Large ferns were also
abundant with Virginia Chain Fern at the water's edge and Cinnamon
Fern behind this. As we progressed along the north shore - an
environment quite unlike that of the south shore - we saw more Water
Loosestrife, and in quite deep water, tall culms of the coastal
grass <i>Panicum</i>  <i>hemitomon</i>. Also included in the
relatively lush vegetation here were Fox Grape with large but unripe
fruit, the dodder <i>Cuscuta  compacta  </i>and Groundnut  (<i>Apios
 americana</i>). 
<p>After
rounding the Pond's east end we encountered a patchy strand of Large
Cranberry not previously observed by us. In one place amongst the
Cranberry there were several Pitcher Plants  (<i>Saracenia  purpurea
</i>), likely variety <i>venosa</i>, since these plants were short
and broad. It is possible and even likely that they were planted
here. Associated herbs included<i> Carex </i> <i>folliculata</i>,
Cotton Sedge  (<i>Eriophorum  virginicum</i>),  a bladderwort (<i>Utricularia </i> sp)  and Marsh St. Johns-wort  (<i>Hypericum 
virginicum</i>  or <i>Triadenum  fraseri</i>).  Adjacent moist shady
slopes bore many plants of the orchid Whorled Pogonia  (<i>Isotria 
verticillata</i>),  which, in the absence of an inflorescence,
closely resembled <i>Medeola</i>. Also seen in moist areas was Black
Choke Berry as distinguished by its blue-black fruits.
<p>Our
survey of 8-25-96 included a more detailed inventory of the pond
number 2  (of B 13)  near the 1600 foot contour as well as cursory
observations of other ponds along the woods road.
<p>Early
on, along the woods road we noted Bear Oak (<i> Quercus  ilicifolia
</i>) for the first time, then the root-bearing fungus <i>Collybia 
radicata </i> var  <i>furfuracea </i>  (or  <i>Xerula  furfuracea </i>),
Starved Panic Grass  (<i>Panicum </i> <i>depauperatum</i>), 
Black-seeded Needle Grass  (<i>Stipa  avenacea </i>) and Red Fescue
 (<i>Festuca  rubra </i>).
<p>The
 pond number 2  (of B 13)  is bordered by an old clearcut.  Now dry,
this pond was notable for the diversity of its grasses and coastal
plain herbs. These included Long-leaved Panic Grass  (<i>Panicum 
longifolium</i>),  Switch Grass  (<i>P.  virgatum</i>),  <i>P. 
verrucosum</i>,  Yellow Indian Grass  (<i>Sorghastrum  nutans</i>), 
Little Bluestem  (<i>Andropogan  scoparius </i>), Hairgrass (
<i>Agrostis  hyemalis</i>),  Bushy Aster, Lance-leaf Violet,  the
St. Johns-wort <i>Hypericum  gymnanthum</i>, Meadow Beauty  (<i>Rhexia
 mariana </i>) in bloom, Marsh Pink  (<i>Sabatia  campanula </i>),
also in bloom, and Wild Indigo. Especially imposing was the
flowering Switch Grass, while Yellow Indian Grass and Little
Bluestem were only coming into bloom.
<p>We next
visited the pond that lies to the west of the fork in the woods road
 (Willow 3 of B 13)  and which was first visited on 5-23-94. Our
visit here was only long enough to confirm the presence of Dwarf
Willow. A return to this pond a week later would result in a more
detailed inventory.
<p>Returning
again to the pond southeast of Twin Pond  (Oak),  where we had
previously seen the Broadhead Skink, we were greeted by a striking
sight. This consisted of  numerous frogs, quite large and bright
green, and which we took to be Green Frogs, that were spotted at
regular intervals of several meters along the water's edge. Some
adjacent frogs were observed to engage in tussles with each other,
as if in rivalry. On our closer approach all leapt into deeper water
with loud squeeks. Also seen here was a Painted Turtle  (<i>Chrysemys
 picta </i>), abundant filimentous spikerush and <i>Sphagnum</i>. At
Twin Pond, as in the previous year, Virginia Sneezeweed and White
Buttons were in bloom. However, the water was lower and the adjacent
Dangleberry crop not nearly as large.
Terminating
our traverse at Spring  Pond was uneventful except for observing a
plant of some  interest, namely both staminate and pistillate
Devil's Bit  (<i>Chamaelirium  luteum</i>)  and a caterpillar with a
remarkable resemblance to a leaf in the nearby upland forest.
<p>On
8-31-96, a clear, warm and dry day, a return visit was made to some
sites visited the week earlier. The first of these was the pond
number 2  (of B 13)  near the 1600 ft. contour.  Here three soil
samples  (Table 1),  all from surface layers, were taken as follows:
MF1 from the pond edge near haircap moss, MF2 near a patch of Yellow
Indian Grass within the pond and MF3 near a clump of Long-leaved
Panic Grass near the pond's center. Additional plants identified at
this pond were a large bush of Black Haw Viburnum at the pond's edge
and clumps of <i>Carex  complanatum</i>  in the adjacent forest.
Also noted was a slight penetration of Little Bluestem and Yellow
Indian Grass into the ericaceous shrub layer at the pond's edge.
Insects that were conspicuous at this pond were yellow jacket
hornets, red dragonflies and dark swallowtail butterflies.
<p>Next
visited was the larger pond  (Pond Deep 17 of B 13),  also along the
1600 foot contour, and which had been the object of our 11-6-94
visit. Like the pond of the previous week, this pond was blessed
with rimming frogs that leapt squeaking into deeper water as they
were approached. Birds, likely Wood Ducks,  also rose from the
water. The only conspicuous herbaceous vegetation noted consisted of
spikerush, some panicum and a few clumps of White Buttons. A soil
sample  (MF4)  was taken from the water's edge. The loud drumming of
an unidentified woodpecker sounded from the surrounding woods.
<p>A
further survey was also done at the pond  (Willow 3)  that lies just
west of the fork in the woods road and which was briefly visited on
5-23-94 and 8-25-96. As previously noted, Dwarf Upland Willow is
conspicuous in this pond's vegetation. Associates were yellow Indian
Grass, Little Bluestem, Saw Brier, Creeping Five-leaf, Wild Indigo,
Bushy Aster, Arrow-leaf Violet, Bracken Fern and the two milkworts
<i>Polygala  brevifolia</i>  and<i> P.  incarnata </i>. In places
there was a deep carpet of mosses, including haircap, and <i>Cladina</i>
 lichen. Haircap, other mosses and <i>Cladina</i>  were also
abundant under huckleberry at the pond's edge, which is rimmed by
Black Gum, Red Maple, Pitch Pine, Post and Pin Oaks and Highbush
Blueberry. Also seen here was a Cricket Frog, although no standing
water was present.
<p>A brief
return to Twin Pond was greeted by a large bird, likely a Blue
Heron. Particularly impressive along the woods road on our return
was the blaze of Golden Asters.
<p>The
acid character of all the sinkhole ponds visited is clearly
indicated by the character of their vegetation and this is
substantiated by the pH values and general chemistry exhibited in
Table1. The acidic nature of the water has also been established by
direct analysis  (Downey <i>et al</i>, 1999) . Of particular
interest is how characteristic prairie species such as Little
Bluestem, Yellow Indian Grass and Switch Grass thrive in this acidic
environment. The acidity also indicates that the movement of water
is prevailingly downward and that artesian springs that might access
the underlying carbonates are not active.

Walks: 3-28-99, 4-26-99 and 5-9-99</h2>
<ul>
<p>This
report contains additional observations on phenology as well as
adding a few new species to our tally. Each of the three surveys
extended along the woods road, included adjacent ponds and
terminated at Spring Pond. That of 3-28-99 also included a brief
observation of an irregular forest swamp on the divide between
Canada Run and Kennedy Creek, while those of 4-26-99 and 5-9-99
began with observations in the mesic forest along Coal Road.
<p>Our
survey of 3-28-99, on a sunny, pleasant day, began with a cursory
visit to the small forested swamp  (18 of B 13)  on the Canada Run-
Kennedy Creek divide. The canopy in this swamp is dominated by Red
Maple and Black Gum with scattered Pitch Pine, while White Oak is
restricted to its slightly elevated edge. Although Mountain Laurel
occurs along its edge, there is little or no undergrowth in the
swamp itself. Unidentified species of <i>Sphagnum</i>, <i>Hypnum</i>
and other mosses dominate the ground cover.
<p>Next,
moving along the woods road, we arrived at a tiny conical pond  (16
of B 13).  The pignut <i>Carya glabra</i>  occurs with oaks at the
pond edge, where Saw Brier and unidentified species of <i>Dicranum</i>
 and <i>Polytrichum</i> mosses also occurred. Cricket Frogs were
observed and a Spring Peeper was heard calling. Mr Don Church, a
herpetologist we encountered, was kind enough to reveal the presence
of centimeter-long larvae of the Marbled Salamander  (<i>Ambystoma 
opacum</i>)  in this pond.
<p>As we
passed the largest false pond we startled a flock of perhaps five
Wood Ducks and, on a foray to Elusive Pond, observed abundant
Mistletoe on Black Gum o the Pond's southeast side.
<p>We
then observed Trailing Arbutus  (<i>Epigaea  repens </i>) and a
Turkey Vulture (<i> Cathartes  aura </i>) on our way to Oak Pond,
where we noted the Eastern Newt  (<i>Notophthalmus  viridescens</i>
), a water scorpion  (Corixidae)  and numerous Cricket Frogs.
Following these we made a brief visit to Twin Pond, where we saw
Mourning Cloak  (<i>Nymphalis  antiopa </i>) and unidentified brown
and orange butterflies, and to Spring Pond where we were greeted by
the trumpeting of Canada Geese. Also noted in the upland forest were
a few Adelgid-infected Hemlock as well as Black Cherry and Black
Locust  (<i>Robinia  pseudoacacia </i>) of poor form.
<p>Of
significance on the 4-26-99 visit was the observation on the drive
in of a single blooming Redbud  (Cercis  canadensis)  immediately
adjacent to Coal Road. This tree, which is quite demanding of
nutrients, likely depended for these on road gravel, and its
occurrence was in stark and enlightening exception to the general
Maple Flats area, where the species was not observed by us.
<p>An
opportunity was taken to measure the pH of the branch of Canada Run
that feeds the false ponds and which flows through the tract of
mesic forest near Coal Road. To avoid possible contamination by the
road,the sample was taken to the south and upstream from the road.
The value obtained was pH=5.3. Also noted in the vicinity of this
tract was abundant Marsh Blue Violet and Wild Pansy  (<i>Viola 
rafinesquii</i>),  both in bloom, as well as numerous Cricket Frogs
and droppings of the Cottontail Rabbit  (<i>Sylvilagus  floridanus
</i>).
<p>Moving
once more along the woods road but still near Coal Road, we
encountered Japanese Honeysuckle (<i> Lonicera  japonica </i>),
Cleavers  (<i>Galium</i>  <i>aperine </i>) and a large patch of May
Apple (<i> Podophyllum  peltatum </i>), with the last-named growing
out of a heavy mat of oak leaves. It is likely that these mesic
species, as observed earlier, owe their presence here to nutrients
that resulted from human activities associated with construction of
the false ponds. Faunal sightings here included Ruby-throated
Hummingbird  (<i>Archilochus </i> <i>colubris</i>),  butterflies and
bumblebees on Autumn olive.
<p>A
striking sight in the dry ericaceous upland forest was the abundance
of Flowering Dogwood in bloom.  Conspicuous along the woods road
were scattered <i>Carya  glabra</i>, Pitch and Shortleaf Pines,
including seedlings and saplings, Creeping Five-leaf (<i> Potentilla
 canadensis </i>), Rattlesnake Weed  (<i>Hieracium  venosum</i>), 
Trailing Arbutus, Teaberry, Spotted Wintergreen and a violet with
leaves resembling those of <i>Viola  primulifolia, </i>but with deep
purple flowers.In one place Black Haw Viburnum grew with Mountain
Laurel under Chestnut Oak in a good illustration of the large
stability field and association range of this viburnum. Insects in
this community included a small black butterfly and an inch-long
grasshopper.
<p>Continuing
on to Oak Pond, the now-familiar squeaking frogs were again present
at the water's edge, as were abundant dragonflies.  Of interest also
was the identification as <i>Carya  glabra </i> of <i> </i>an
impressive 29 inch  (0.74 m)  dbh tree that dominates this ponds
topographic rim. 
<p>Then
moving overland from this large pignut toward Twin Pond, two small
Mockernut Hickories, a Black Oak with a prominent fire scar and an
occurrence of Wild Lupine  (<i>Lupinus  perennis </i>) were
successively noted. In close association with the Lupine was the
alien Hairy Vetch  (<i>Vicia  villosa </i>), which was in bloom.
After listening to Spring Peepers at Twin Pond, the traverse was
terminated at Spring Pond, where Swamp Pink was in full bloom.
<p>Our
5-9-99 visit began with another inventory of the mesic forest near
Coal Road. Bird life was quite varied and common and included
Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Red-eyed Vireo  (<i>Vireo  olivaceus</i>), 
Great Crested Flycatcher  (<i>Myiarchus  crinitus </i>), Blue Jay (<i>
Cyanocitta  cristata</i>),  White-breasted Nuthatch, Red-bellied
Woodpecker, as well as small unidentified birds - likely warblers -
in the canopy. Scarlet Tanager calls were heard quite frequently as
well. Other fauna included a Red Eft of the Eastern Newt, Red-backed
Salamander  (<i>Plethodon </i> <i>cinereus</i>),  Dusky Salamander (
<i>Desmognathus  fuscus </i>) and a great number of Cricket Frogs,
especially near the stream. It appeared that the number of
salamanders recorded depended only on the number of of rocks or
pieces of woody debris we were willing to overturn. All in all the
impression was of a healthy amphibian fauna in this tract of mesic
forest.
<p>Additional
plants not previously observed here were Minnie-bush, Tasslerue (
<i>Trautvetteria  caroliniensis </i>), a single blooming anemone,
either <i>A</i>.  <i>quinquefolia  </i>or <i>A.  lancifolia  </i>and
common aromatically-blooming Sweet White Violet  (<i>Viola  blanda
</i>). Mosses included a species of<i> Atrichum</i>  and an
intergrowth of <i>Thuidium  delicatulum</i>  and a <i>Mnium</i>. 
The fungus <i>Urnula </i> <i>craterium</i> was found at the base of
a fallen Black Oak with very shallow roots.
<p>Also
found in an area of dumped spoil that appeared enriched in nutrients
were Sensitive Fern, a single plant of Wild Geranium  (<i>Geranium</i>
 <i>maculatum </i>) and a small patch of May Apple. 
<p>Again
on the woods road, we heard the call of an Oven Bird  (<i>Seiurus</i>
 <i>aurocapillus</i>).  Near Oak Pond a single small Striped Maple (
<i>Acer </i> <i>pensylvanicum</i>)  was noted, as were Towhees and a
Wood Duck at Twin Pond.
<p>At
Spring Pond Pink Azalea was in full bloom, but Swamp Pink flowers
had faded. Here we observed a Yellow-billed Cuckoo at close range
and heard a Wood Thrush call from a considerable distance. Both
Green and Gray Tree Frogs called along the shore, and we again
noticed the great variation of colors - ranging from bright green to
black - of the Cricket Frogs.

<ul>

<p>I
attempted to take a pH reading with a Kelway Soil Tester in the
forest floor within the mesic   (reltively)  forest near Coal Road.
However I was unsuccessful, frustrated by the very heavy organic (
mor)  layer, which was too compressible for this type of meter to
yield an accurate value. We then hiked to Pond 5 east of Spring
Pond, where I obtained a reading of pH = 6.0 in mud rich in organic
matter. We then hiked to Horseshoe Swamp, where, in the deep leaf
mould of a Red Maple - Black Oak - White Oak - Pitch Pine swamp
forest, I recorded pH = 5.0. We then turned south to Split Level (
no 9)  Pond, noting it was covered by dead grass, much of which
appeared to be Switch Grass. Beaver sign was also abundant here,
Finally, while traversing to Pond 7 we observed several healthy -
appearing  American Chestnut saplings up to 4 inches  (10 cm)  dbh.

<ul>
<p>The
weather was mild, with an almost cloudless sky, as I arrived at
about noon at the junction of the forest road with Coal Road just
west of the false ponds. The primary objectives of this visit were
soil temperature and pH determinations  (Mueller, 2002).  Red - eyed
Vireos called and I noted an inch - long  (2.5 cm)  Gypsy Moth
caterpillar, the first evidence of the insect here in years. I then
proceeded to make pH and soil temperature measurements in the
adjacent tract of the previously cited mesic forest. A flat area
about 2 meters from a branch of Canada run was chosen among
Partridge Berry. The temperature determination  (T - 36),  at the
conventional depth of 5 inches  (13 cm)  yielded T = 12.0 deg C. The
soil sample  (no 1 of the series),  taken from a depth of 2 - 3
inches  (5 - 8 cm)  had an  pH value of 4.5 both initially and 28
hours later.
<p>The next
station chosen for measurements was a little west of the forest road
and perhaps 250 yards north of the steel gate on a flat aspect and
under mature Pitch Pine in the upland forest and among Upland Low
Blueberry and Red Maple seedlings. A soil temperature  (T - 37)  of
T = 11.0 deg C was obtained at the 5 inch depth in yellow sand soil
under thin needle mor. A soil sample  (no 2 of the series)  from a 2
- 3 inch depth had an initial pH value of 4.1, but 28 hours one of
4.5.
 The
third station was located just east the forest road and a little
southwest of Spring Pond. The call of a Gray Tree Frog was heard on
the way to this station. The station was located under an oak canopy
that included Chestnut Oak. A soil temperature  (T - 38)  of 12.0
deg C was obtained at the usual depth of 5 inches on a flat aspect.
A soil sample  (no 3 of the series)  taken from the usual depth of 2
- 3 inches, had a pH of 4.4 both initially and 28 hours later. The
soil of these determinations was white sand with dark organic matter
under a thin mor.
<p>The
fourth station was located about half way between station 3 and
Spring Pond on a slight slope of northeast aspect, under abundant
Chestnut Oak, with a sparse ground cover of blooming Common Many
Knees  (<i>Polygonatum  biflorum </i>) and Downy Seviceberry 
seedlings. The soil here was a semi - mor or sandy mull. The soil
temperature  (T - 39)  at the usual depth was T = 12.5 deg C. A soil
sample  (no 4 of the series),  from the usual depth yielded pH = 4.5
both initially and 28 hours later. 
<p>
The
fifth station was near. the edge of Spring Pond, which was unusually
high as a result of Beaver action  (according to Fred Huber of the
US Forest Service, who was encountered on the traverse). 
Consequently water extended perhaps 20 feet  (six meters)  inland
from the tree line of the old shore. The aspect was essentially
flat. Ground cover consisted largely of Mountain Laurel and
Teaberry. The soil temperature  (T - 40)  at the usual depth was T =
12.5 deg C. The soil sample  (no 5 of the series),  also from the
conventional depth, had an initial pH value of 4.0 and 28 hours
later one of 3.8. The soil consisted of a thin mor above white sand.

<p>
A return
was now made to the point of origin, during which two Scarlet
Tanagers were heard singing. A little north of the gate there is a
seep or springbrook that flows from the west. Stunted May Apple  (<i>Podophyllum  peltatum</i>)  grew on the brook's bank, in one of only two
known occurrence of this plant in the entire area of Maple Flats
explored in our project. In a determination of the brook's water,
the pH was found to be 5.2. 


<p>Readings
of soil temperature and pH  (both at the conventional depths)  were
also taken at a station south of Coal Road about five meters from
Canada Run under Mountain Laurel. The soil temperature  (T - 42), 
on a flat aspect, was found to be T = 13.0 deg C The soil sample had
a pH of 4.5 both initially and 28 hours later.

<p>
An
additional observation this day was of blooming <i>Potentilla 
canadensis, </i>confirming once more the presence of this<i>
species.</i>

<p>As
in all our bryophyte determinations, it is informative to compare
the species and their frequencies here with those of other forest
types. In what follows much of the discussion is based on Crum and
Anderson  (1981).  Among the most common species are <i>Entodon 
seductrix</i>, <i>Campylium  chrysophyllum</i>, <i>Polytrichum  ohioense</i>
and <i>Anomodon rostratus</i>. All are common in eastern North
America and a variety of Central Appalachian forest types in
particular. <i>Entodon seductrix, Ditrichum  pallidum, Leucobryum 
albidum</i> and a number of other species are characteristic of dry,
rather open oak forests such as dominate in the Maple Flats upland
and which border the sinkhole ponds. <i>Climacium  americanum</i>,
var  <i>kinderbergii</i>, although relatively frequent in occurrence
here, is so by virtue of its aquatic form in the pond habitat, as
are <i>Aulacomnium  palustre</i>.and<i> Fontinalis. Hypnum 
curvifolium</i>, a species characteristic of moist environments and
down wood debris in cool mesic forests, occurs at pond edges and on
moist woody debris  in particular. Of particular interest are
<i>Dicranum  polysetum, Drepanocladus  fluitans,, Isopterygium 
elegans, Pleurozium  schreberi</i> and <i>Tetraphis  pellucida</i>.
The first of these is relatively uncommon    - at  least in our
inventories -  in the Central Appalachians, but is widespread
northward and ranges south to North Carolina. <i>Depanocladus 
fluitans</i> is characteristic of bogs, meadows and swales across
the high north and ranges south only to West Virginia and Virginia.
It was found by Gibson  (1970)  in Alder Run Bog in West Virginia's
Dolly Sods, a severe boreal habitat, and is uncommon in the Central
Appalachians. <i>Ispoterygium  elegans</i>  also has a northern
distribution, <i>Pleurozium  schreberi</i> is quite common in cool,
acidic forests of these mountains, and  northern in distribution.
<i>Tetraphis  pellucida</i>, like a number of the observed species,
is strongly acidiphile, and like  the foregoing, has a dominantly
northern range. It was one of the two most frequent species found by
us in West Virginia's Cathedral State Forest's Hemlock groves. The
calciphile  <i>Campylium  chrysophyllum's</i> relatively frequent
occurrence in this predominantly acidic terrain may have an
explanation in its mode of occurrence on moist humus and decaying
wood. There is some evidence, not all of it yet published in our
inventories, that alkalization may be associated with the pervasive
decay of at least some organic matter  (see the section on Morris
Hill).  Peculiar also, is our failure to find any examples of the
ordinarily widespread genus <i>Mnium</i>. Finally, although eight
habitats are represented in our survey, none from the complex swamp
forest environment are. It is possible that including this
environment would increase the species number  substantially.

<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<ul>

<p>Beyond its unusual character and beauty, Maple Flats is a premier
classroom of forest ecology. It well illustrates the pedagogic
importance of extreme or end-point habitats in the delineation of
the condition ranges or stability fields of species and communities
 (Mueller,1998, 2000).  By mapping out these extremes in terms of
environmental factors such as physical, chemical and biologic
variables, the stability ranges of individual species can be
determined. The extreme chemical composition of the siliceous fossil
alluvium and the profound acid leaching this alluvium has been
subject to, allow us, to a first approximation, to combine virtually
all major soil nutrients in making comparisons with other forest
types. The deficiencies of nutrients in the soils of Maple Flats are
so great that the position of the area in the multidimensional space
of environmental factors is well separated from that of rich mesic
forests and even from those of common forest types as shown in
figure 1. This is illustrated by the low species number of canopy
trees, by the shrub types and by the wetland-related species. The
limited  availability of nutrients is also reflected in the
restricted numbers of both species and individuals of mammals (
Reynolds<i> et al</i>, 1999)  and Reptiles  (Mitchell and Buhlmann,
1999)   An interesting contrast, however, is the apparent abundance
of certain forest interior birds, such as the Scarlet Tanager, which
usually indicates rich habitat. It is likely that the observed
abundance of this bird is due to the presence of abundant water and
associated habitat diversity, features which may assert themselves
more in birds than in ground dwelling animals. Plants which occur in
both rich mesic forests  and here - Black and White Oaks, Red Maple,
Black Gum, Virginia Creeper, Common Greenbrier, to name a few - have
very large stability fields indeed. The occurrence of bryophytes
exclusive of the <i>Sphagnum</i>s also fits the pattern. While the
number of species found by us is not great, some  uncommon
northerners are represented. The impressive assemblage of unusual
and disjunct species in the general flora is probably a result of
the habitat diversity engendered by the sinkhole ponds and swamp
forests. Thus habitat diversity apparently counters low nutrient
availability in this case. Finally the area wonderfully illustrates
why the term &quot; conservation biology &quot; is inadequate in
this and many other cases when the physico-chemical environment is
so much in command. Only &quot; conservation ecology &quot; is an
adequate term in these cases - and I believe, quite generally.
