<h1>Meadow Creek Watershed</h1>
<b>Greenbrier County, West Virginia</b>
<br><b>November, 1999</b>

<ul><blockquote>


 
 
 
 
<p>
<p><b>General</b>
<p>
<ul>
<p> Meadow Creek, a branch of Anthony Creek, extends from
Neola to above the Lake Sherwood impoundment. In terms of bedrock, the area of
our inventories is underlain by the Mississippian
Pocono Formation ( Cardwell et al 1968 ). Elevations range from 2200 feet ( 671 m ) to 2680 feet ( 817 m ) near Lake
Sherwood. In only a few adjacent places does the Watershed attain elevations
exceeding 3000 feet ( 915 m ) asl. Soils appear to be prevailingly acidic,and
in at least some places, such as the vicinity of Lake Sherwood, clay-rich.
Generally the Pocono Formation is dominated by massive sandstone with minor
shale, coal beds and other rocks. Presumably where clay-rich soils occur, bedrock
is locally shaly or possibly is fault gouge. This range of possibilities is
supported by the generally low relief and subdued topography in the vicinity of
the Lake.
<p> As is well-known from reports of the original forest
cover ( Brooks, 1910 ), White Pine was
generally abundant in the Anthony Creek Watershed and indeed in adjacent
watersheds such as that of Knapp Creek and elsewhere immediately west of
Allegheny Mountain. This circumstance appears to indicate a strong climatic
factor in its occurrence since a variety of rocks underlie these areas. While
this tree is frequently associated with light, sandy soils, it seems here to
thrive on heavy clay as well. It does so well in fact that it seems to be able
to hold its own with deciduous species and in some cases show a spontaneous
resurgence in these forests after their original reduction by logging and
fires. This behavior with respect to deciduous species appears to contradict
experience in such regions as the Lake States where White Pine is regarded as
dependant on large openings to become established.
<p> Four separate inventories were conducted in the
Watershed, one along the Meadow Creek mainstem, one along Laurel Run, one along
the Upper Meadow Creek Trail at Lake Sherwood and one along the Lake Sherwood
Trail.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul>
<p> <b>Meadow Creek Mainstem</b>

<br><b>Source Walk: 5-20-98</b>
<ul>
<p><b> </b>The location of this inventory was confined to a
stream-side site somewhat over a mile ( 1.6 km ) upstream from the Ruckers Gap
road junction with Route 14, which parallels the Creek. Our inventory was
opportunistic in that the site was our over-night camp on this clear and
pleasant evening.
<p> Elevation here is near 2500 feet ( 763 m ) asl.
Sandstone exposed along the stream is almost horizontal and a measurement of
the stream water yielded pH= 5.0. Meadow Creek was high and its roar loud
enough to obscure most faunal sounds.
<p> The forest appeared to be young, perhaps of the order
of 50 years in age, with a canopy dominated by White Oak, but with abundant
Northern Red Oak, Red Maple, White and Pitch Pines, some Virginia Pine, White
Ash, Sugar Maple, American Basswood, Canada Hemlock, Black Birch, Black Locust,
Black Cherry and Sassafras. The understory included Serviceberry, Flowering
Dogwood and the hawthorn<i>Crataegus
flabellata</i>. Shrubs along the stream were Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) , Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i>) , Ninebark (<i>Physocarpus opulifoius</i>) , Silky Willow (
<i>Salix sericea</i>) , Silky Dogwood (<i>Cornus amomum</i>), Wild Plum (<i>Prunus americana</i>) , Smooth Alder (<i>Alnus serrulata</i>) , Staghorn Sumac (<i>Rhus typhina</i>) and Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>) .
<p> A stand of Red and Sugar Maples, Northern Red Oak,
Black Birch and Hemlock had a ground cover consisting of Heartleaf (<i>Hexastylis virginica</i>) , Four-leaved Yam
(<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>) , Wild
Geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>) ,
Cut-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago arguta</i>
), Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum
acrostichoides</i>) , Bunch Flower (<i>Veratrum
parviflorum</i>) , Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina
racemosa</i>) , White Clintonia (<i>Clintonia
umbellulata</i>) , Carrion Flower (<i>
Smilax herbacea</i>) , Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia
nudicaulis</i>) and <i>Carex</i> <i>gracillima</i>. Also found in the nearby
forest were Downy Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum
pubescens</i>) and Fly Poison (<i>Amianthium
muscaetoxicum</i>) .
<p> A community more in the open consisted of a
side-lighted stand of American Basswood, Northern Red Oak, Red Maple, White
Ash, Black Cherry, Downy Serviceberry, Hophornbeam and Sassafras with Summer
Grape (<i>Vitis aestivalis</i>) , Virginia
Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</i>
), Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax
rotundifolia</i>) , Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum</i>
<i>acerifolium</i>) , Witch Hazel, Creeping
Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex</i>) ,
Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i>
), Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>
) and the only Spotted Wintergreen (<i>
Chimaphila maculata</i>) seen in the Watershed.
<p> A likely more acidic community at the forest edge
along the road consisted of Mountain Laurel, Heartleaf, Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda claytoniana</i>) , Bracken Fern (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) and Wood Betony (<i>Pedicularis canadensis</i>) .
<p> Other species seen along the road, particularily in
richer soil areas, and which may have benefitted from road-derived nutrients,
were Flat-top White Aster (<i>Aster
umbellatus</i>) , Late Goldenrod (<i>Solidago
gigantea</i>) , Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia
quadrifolia</i>) , Bloodroot (<i>
Sanguinaria canadensis</i>) , Barren Strawberry (<i>Waldsteinia fragarioides</i>) , Steel's Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum steeleanum</i>) , Variable Panic
Grass (<i>Panicum commutatum</i>) and <i>Carex laxiflora</i>.
<p> Birds heard above the sound of the stream were Scarlet
Tanager (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>) .
Red-eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>) ,
and on the morning after a night of rain, Ovenbird (<i>Seiurus aurocapillus</i>) and Baltimore Oriole (<i>Icterus glabula</i>) . Also heard were the calls of Spring Peepers (<i>Hyla crucifer</i>) .
<p>&nbsp;
</ul>
<p><b>Laurel Run</b>
<br> 
<b>Source Walk: 5-21-98</b>
<ul>
<p><b> </b>Flowing directly north, Laurel Run joins Meadow Creek
at an elevation of 2212 feet ( 675 m) upstream from a sharp bend in the latter.
Our traverse during a rainy morning extended south along the stream for about
1500 feet ( 458 m ) to the first ford. Because our stay was brief, no attempt
was made to record all species along this relatively rich acid-mesic
bottomland.
<p> The canopy near the stream is dominated by White Oak
with substantial Northern Red Oak, Shagbark Hickory, Red and Sugar Maples,
Black Birch, American Basswood, Tuliptree, White Pine, Canada Hemlock, White
Ash, Sassafras and a little Big-tooth Aspen (<i>Populus grandidentata</i>) . A single Wild Crabapple (<i>Malus coronaria</i>) was seen.
<p> The shrub layer was dominated by Great Rhododendron (
<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) with abundant
Witch Hazel and less common Ninebark, Wild Raisin (<i>Viburnum cassinoides</i>) , Allegheny Blackberry (<i>Rubus allegheniensis</i>) and doubtless others.
<p> The entire stretch of bottom land surveyed appeared
to be covered by a rich but distinctly acid-disposed flora. Included were
Interrupted and Bracken Ferns, New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis</i>) , large patches of Barren Strawberry,
Wild Sarsaparilla, Goats Beard (<i>Aruncus
dioicus</i>) , Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria
procumbens</i>) , Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium
flabelliforme</i>) , Bunch Flower, White Clintonia, Creeping Five-leaf, Foam
Flower (<i>Tiarella cordifolia</i>) in
bloom, Four-leaved Yam, a luxuriant patch of an unidentified Iris, Poke
Milkweed (<i>Asclepias exaltata</i>) , Wood
Betony, Tall Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum
pubescens</i>) , Blue Monkshood (<i>Aconitum
uncinatum</i>) , Wild Blue Phlox (<i>Phlox
divaricata</i>) in bloom, Hairy-jointed Meadow Parsnip (<i>Thaspium barbinode</i>) , Wreath Goldenrod (<i>Solidago caesia</i>) , Big-leaf Aster, Mountain Oatgrass (<i>Danthonia compressa</i>) , the forest
bluegrass <i>Poa alsodes</i>, <i>Carex stipata</i> and <i>C. laevivaginata</i>. A number of the more acid-loving species such as
Teaberry and Ground Pine were concentrated under Rhododendron.
<p> Like that of the bottom land forest, the canopy of
the adjacent upland forest is dominated by White Oak and, although fewer
species are present, Northern Red Oak, Red and Sugar Maples, Shagbark Hickory
and White Pine also occur in the area inventoried. A little Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>) occurs in the
understory. Found in the ground cover were Cucumbertree seedlings, Maidenhair
Fern (<i>Adiantum pedatum</i>) , Round-lobe
Hepatica (<i>Hepatica americana</i>) ,
Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa uniflora</i>) ,
Squaw Root (<i>Conopholis americanus</i>) 
and <i>Carex laxiflora</i>. Under a large
White Pine bordering the bottom land, and on its north side, a large patch of
blooming Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum
canadense</i>) decorated the forest floor. Accompanying the Mayflower within a
meter radius were Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia
perfoliata</i>) , Downy Many Knees, Canada Brome Grass (<i>Bromus</i> <i>purgans</i>) , Bunch
Flower, Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum
lanuginosum</i>) , Lovage (<i>Ligusticum
canadense</i>) , Black Cohosh, New York and Interruped Ferns and <i>Carex gracilescens</i>. 
<p> Birds seen or heard on the traverse included
Ovenbird, Black-throated Blue Warbler (<i>
Dendroica caerulescens</i>) , Rose-breasted Grossbeak (<i>Pheucticus ludovicianus</i>) and the only Wood Thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustelina</i>) thus far in the
Watershed, or indeed along Anthony Creek as well.
<p> Despite the presence of isolated northern species
such as Canada Mayflower and Wild Sarsaparilla, there is little evidence of
cold air trapping in this valley. This result is perhaps to be expected, given
the relatively low mountain ridges in the vicinity.
<p>&nbsp;

<p><b>Upper Meadow Trail</b>

<br><b>Source Walk: 6-16-98</b>
<ul>
<p><b> </b>The Upper Meadow Trail extends from the parking lot at
the southwest end of Lake Sherwood to the crest of Meadow Mountain. Our
traverse was limited to perhaps a half mile ( 0.8 km ) of this trail. The
initial elevation is near Lake level and the Trail does not rise much above
this over the extent of our traverse.
<p> Our inventory began under the threat of rain in
mature forest canopy with White Pine to two feet ( 0.6 m ) or more in diameter
and even thicker but less tall White Oak . Red Maple of smaller size was
common, while the understory consisted of Striped Maple, <i>Crataegus flabellata,</i> Downy Serviceberry, Hophornbeam and, in moist
areas, Muscletree.
<p> Ground cover in the upland forest included
conspicuously-blooming Fly Poison, Mountain Bellwort (<i>Uvularia pudica</i>) , the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum,</i> a few plants of the northern Large
Round-leaved Orchid (<i>Habenaria
orbiculata</i>) , Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella
repens</i>) Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera
pubescens</i>) , New York Fern and the uncommon grass <i>Calamagrostis porteri</i>. 
<p> Flowing through this forest was a quite strong
springbrook with a yellow clay bottom and shale fragments. pH of the water was
5.5. The flora associated with this springbrook included Witch Hazel, Ground
Berry (<i>Rubus hispidus</i>) , Cinnamon
Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>) ,
Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium virgiianum</i>
), lush examples of the sedges <i>Carex
scabrata</i> and <i>C</i>. <i>debilis,</i> also <i>C. baileyi, C. swanii, C. gynandra</i>, White Wood Aster (<i>Aster</i> <i>divaricatus</i>) , Crooked-stem Aster (<i>A. prenanthoides</i>) , Wreath Goldenrod, Tall Meadowrue, Round-leaf
Pyrola (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia</i>) ,
Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum
</i>), Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola
virginiana</i>) Blue Monkshood, Bunch Flower, Indian Pipe, Wood Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>) , Barren
Strawberry, Plume Lily, Hairy Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza claytoni</i>) , Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>) , Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus
virginicus</i>) , Woodland Meadow Parsnip (<i>Thaspium
trifoliatum</i>) , Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis stricta</i>) , Creeping Five-leaf, Mad-dog Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria lateriflora</i>) , Mountain Oat
Grass and Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca</i> <i>obtusa</i>) . Fungi noted were <i>Collybia dryophila, Pluteus
flavofuligineus </i>and <i>Hygrophorus psitacinus</i>.. Ovenbirds,
Scarlet Tanagers and a distant Wood Thrush were heard here.
<p> Now moving onward through upland forest with a mature
canopy of White Pine and White Oak, we noted,in succession, seedlings and
saplings of White Ash, Downy Serviceberry (<i>
Amelanchier arborea</i>) , saplings of Hemlock, Christmas Fern, the fungus <i>Amanita flavoconia</i> or &quot;Yellow
Patches&quot;, Spittle Bugs on White Pine saplings, Wild Liquorice (<i>Galium circaezans</i>) , Canada Brome Grass
(<i>Bromus purgans</i>) , Sugar Maple
saplings, a 32 inch ( 0.87 m ) dbh White Pine, Purple Bedstraw (<i>Galium latifolium</i>) , dead and diseased
but also healthy-appearing Flowering Dogwood, Black Cohosh and White Snakeroot
(<i>Eupatorium rugosum</i>) . Pressing
ahead we saw Thyme-leaved Bluets (<i>Houstonia
serpyllifolia</i>) , Nodding Fescue, the alien Canada Bluegrass (<i>Poa compressa</i>) , <i>Carex laxiflora</i>, then abundant Mountain Oat Grass at the trail
edge, more Sugar Maple saplings, large White Pine and White Oak with a very
sparse ground flora and a heavy leaf mat consisting almost entirely of White
Oak leaves. Next seen were scattered Hemlock, more Downy Serviceberry,followed
by the call of a Wood Thrush, then more Canada Brome Grass, <i>Carex appalachica</i>, Four-leaved Milkweed
(<i>Asclepias</i> <i>quadrifolia</i>) in bloom, Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria pubera</i>) , the panic grass <i>Panicum boscii</i>, <i>Brachyelytrum
erectum</i> ,the fungus <i>Crepidotus
applanatus</i>, <i>Oxalis Stricta</i> ( a
virtual constant along the Trail ), more Thyme-leaved Bluets, the fungi <i>Amanita vaginata </i>and <i>Laccaria laccata</i>,
then the first Teaberry with ever-present Fly Poison, followed by more ailing
Flowering Dogwood, the fungi <i>Collybia
confluens </i>and <i>Mycena haematopus</i> ( edible and with a blood red latex ) in
association with the moss <i>Hypnum</i> and Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>) on a dead down
bole. Emerging from the moss <i>Dicranum</i>
was the tiny fungus <i>Rickenella fibula</i>.
These were followed by Upland Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>) in association with Teaberry and numerous
seedlings of White Pine, then American Chestnut sprouts, Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigaea repens</i>) , Round-leaved Pyrola,
Arrow-leaf Violet (<i>Viola sagittata</i>
), a <i>Cladina</i> lichen, a Gall of the Earth (<i>Prenanthes</i> sp ), Deer Berry (<i>Vaccinium
stamineum</i>) , a little Bowman's Root (<i>Gillenia</i>
<i>trifoliata</i>) and the edible fungus <i>Suillus pictus</i>. . 
<p> We had been passing over gently-rolling terrain and
now reached the main road ( Rt. 14 ). On crossing the road we began to see
Black Huckleberry (<i>Gaylussacia baccata</i>) .
Also seen here was our first Black Gum, <i>Carex
complanata</i> and the fungus <i>Amanita muscaria</i> var <i>formosa</i>,
followed by abundant White Pine, White Oak and Red Maple. The base of a large
White Oak harbored a community of the mosses <i>Aulocomnium heterostichum</i>, two species of <i>Anomodon</i>, a<i>Brachythecium</i>,
a <i>Mnium</i>, <i>Forsstroemia trichomitria</i>, <i>Thuidium
delicatulum</i>,<i>Platygyrium repens</i> and a <i>Campilium</i>.
Associated with them were Upland Low Blueberry, Teaberry, <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i> and Mountain Bellwort. Nearby, on a rotting
down bole stained by the green fungus <i>Chlorociboria
aeruginasces,</i> we saw a brilliant metallic green and red 0.5 cm click beetle
(<i>Elateridae</i>) in one of those
curious juxtapositions that seem to be frequent in wild nature. A little
farther on a small White Oak had, at breast level, a striking colony of the
beautiful moss <i>Neckera pennata</i>.
<p> At this point the trail was interrupted by a power
line opening populated by Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>) and a few plants of Devil's Bit (<i>Chamaelirium luteum</i>) . Mountain Laurel
in bloom also made a scattered appearance. Upon again entering the forest, we
saw our first Cucumbertree and the fungus <i>Marasmius
rotula</i>. We soon approached a springbrook in the vicinity of which was Witch
Hazel, Saw Brier (<i>Smilax glauca</i>) ,
abundant New York Fern, Bushy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum
dichtomum</i>) , <i>Carex digitalis</i>, an
undetermined species of Iris, <i>Leucobryum</i>
cushion moss and the long-rooted edible
fungus <i>Xerula furfuracea</i>. Nearby we
sighted a large stick nest in a White Pine.
<p> As we continued along the trail, Black Huckleberry
appeared to increase in abundance and we encountered the first Chestnut Oak and
Pignut Hickory, although White Pine, White Oak and Red Maple still dominated
the canopy. Here we also saw Flame Azalea (<i>Rhododendron
calendulaceum</i>) , a Red Maple sapling encrusted with<i>Usnea</i> lichen and the moss <i>Ulota crispa</i>, while the ground cover
contained abundant Rattlesnake Weed (<i>Hieracium</i>
<i>venosum</i>) . Next noted were our first
Pitch Pine, the fungus <i>Tricholomopsis</i>
<i>platyphylla</i> ( a species said to be
edible &quot; with caution &quot; ) and the call of an Ovenbird. We then passed
through a small section of a clearcut, perhaps 20 years in age. Beyond the
clearcut large White Pine were accompanied by Chestnut Oak, Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus radicans</i>) , Arrow-leaf Violet,
Thyme-leaved Bluets, Indian Tobacco (<i>
Lobelia inflata</i>) and an unidentified species of <i>Clitocybe</i> fungus. Also
identified on soil here was the moss <i>Rhynchostegium</i>
<i>serrulatum</i>. These were succeeded by
the call of an unidentified Vireo and the moss <i>Campilium chrysophyllum</i> at the base of a sapling.
<p> We then entered another, perhaps 15 year old,
clearcut, seeing patches of unidentified haircap (<i>Polytrichum</i>) moss, a
species of<i>Inocybe</i> fungus, dead Flowering Dogwood and Gay Wings
(<i>Polygalla paucifolia</i>) . The soil
here, as elsewhere, appeared to be clay-rich.
<p> At this point our traverse was terminated due to
impending rain, and we retraced our route. During our return it appeared that
we were being &quot;followed&quot; for some distance by a Scarlet Tanager, who
called repeatedly, although it is possible that more than more than one bird
was involved.
<p> On our return to the parking lot we became aware of
both Black and Scarlet Oaks in its vicinity, although we had seen none on our
traverse. Our arrival was also soon succeeded by a violent hailstorm that
produced 3 cm diameter hailstones that dented an aluminum camper shell roof on
our vehicle. This storm, which piled hailstones in small drifts, was followed
by a large fall in temperature for a short period. 
<p> Additional fungi collected on this traverse and
identified by R. Hunsucker were the following:
<p> <i>Amanita
geminata</i>
<br><i>Lycoperdon
marginatum</i>
<br> <i>Tylopilus
indecisus</i>
<br><i>Austroboletus
gracilis</i>
<br> <i>Micromphala
foetidum</i>
<p><i> </i>Lichens and additional bryophytes from the traverse
were also identified by R. Hunsucker. In the following a lichen and a liverwort
are explicitly indicated and mosses are the rest:
<p><i>Heteroderma
leucomelaena</i>-a lichen on White Oak bark 
<br><i>Mnium
cuspidatum</i>-on base of White Oak
<br> <i>Mnium
affine </i>var<i>ciliare</i>-at base of White Oak on soil, rotten wood
<br> <i>Brachythecium
oxycladon</i>-at base of White Oak on bark
<br> <i>Campilium
chrysophyllum</i>-on bark at base of White Oak
<br><i>Fissidens
osmundioides</i>
<br><i>Haplohymenium
triste</i>-on trunks of White and Northern Red Oaks
<br><i>Tortella
humilis</i>-on bark at base of White Oak, other trees
<br><i>Pylasiella
intricata</i>-on bark of White and Northern Red Oaks
<br> <i>Frullania
brittoniae</i>-liverwort on bark of Oak, Red Maple
<p> 
</ul>
<p> <b>Lake Sherwood Trail</b>
<br><b>Source Walk: 6-17-98</b>
<ul>
<p><b> </b>This and connecting trails circle Lake Sherwood. Our
traverse began at the point of origin of the previous traverse, extended
southeast along the Lake shore, turned sharply northeast, still following the
shore, then returned to its origin along the northwest shore.
<p> Our early morning start was greeted by calls of
Scarlet Tanagers, Wood Thrush, Red Wing Blackbirds (<i>Agelaius phoeniceus</i>) and Green Frogs (<i>Rana clamitans</i>) . Our initial course was through forest dominated
by large, if not old, White Pine, with Northern Red, White and Black Oaks and
abundant Red Maple. A detail here was the Great thickness of the leaves of
Northern Red Oak, which resenbled those of Black Oak, a characteristic also
noted along Meadow Creek. Shrubs and ground flora included Upland Low
Blueberry, Hairy Bedstraw (<i>Galium
pilosum</i>) , Wood Betony, <i>Carex
gracilescens</i> and the fungi <i>Trichaptum biformis</i> ( &quot;the sawdust
maker&quot; ), <i>Scizophyllum</i> <i>commune</i> 
and <i>Stereum complicatum</i>. Other
birds seen were White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>
Sita carolinensis</i>) and Flicker (<i>Colaptes
auratus</i>) . On the nearby Lake shore we identified the Burreed <i>Sparganium</i> <i>androcladum</i>, which is said to favor &quot;muddy shores&quot;,
perhaps reflecting the local clay soil.
<p> Again within the forest, we were attracted by an
unusual community under Northern Red Oak on a northeast-facing earth bank. It
was dominated by Squaw-weed ( Senecio obovatus ) in close association with <i>Carex</i>
<i>willdenowii</i>, <i>Panicum boscii</i>, Wild Liquorice, Black Cohosh, <i>Brachyelytrum</i> <i>erectum</i>,
Blue Wood Aster (<i>Aster cordifolius</i>
), Wreath Goldenrod, Plume Lily, Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>) , Great Chickweed, a Little Teaberry and a few
seedlings of Red Maple. A dense sprinkling of Red Maple seedlings surrounded
the community.
<p> Continuing along the trail, we successively noted
Thyme-leaved Bluets, more Squaw Weed with<i>
Carex gracilescens</i> and Black Haw
Viburnum (<i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>) 
under White Pine, then Rattlesnake Weed, Sugar Maple, the call of an Ovenbird,
Pinesap (<i>Monotropa hypopithys</i>) .
Hophornbeam and New York Fern. Next seen was a somewhat unusual plant, a
species of <i>Polemonium</i>, most likely<i>P. reptans</i> ( Greek Valerian ), a native
despite its common name. Although it resembles its rarer congener <i>P.</i> <i>vanbruntiae</i>
( Jacobs Ladder ), it is smaller and less upright. However we could not make a
positive identification despite the presence of seed capsules. The Polemonium
was here associated with <i>Carex
gracilescens</i> and New York Fern in
moist clay-rich soil. Also present nearby was Cowbane (<i>Oxypolis rigidior</i>) , which resembles <i>Polemonium</i> in the form of its leaves.
<p> Where a springbrook discharges into the Lake we saw
an unidentified loosestrife ( Lysimachia sp ), <i>Carex lurida</i>, Three-way Sedge (<i>Dulichium</i>
<i>arundinaceum</i>) , more <i>Polemonium</i>, the mint <i>Stachys cordata</i>, the edible fungus <i>Hygrophorus flavescens</i> ( characteristic
of damp mossy soils ) and numerous emerging dragon flies, apparantly trying
their wings. Here too we heard a Wood Thrush call.
<p> The trail now passed along the base of a steeper
slope with some quite large Hemlock and Northern Red Oak, but with Pignut
Hickory of undetermined species, White Oak, Red and Sugar Maples, Hophornbeam
and the ever-present White Pine. After a short distance we reached the western
end of the Lake dam. However, just before reaching the dam, and under a canopy
of White Pine and Scarlet Oak, we found the uncommon Northern Bedstraw (<i>Galium boreale</i>) in close association
with <i>Calamagrostis poteri</i>, Plume
Lily, Teaberry, Blue Wood Aster, Big-leaf Aster, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Wild
Geranium and Four-leaved Yam.
<p> On the grass-covered earthen dam we observed Barn
Swallows (<i>Hirundo rustica erythrogaster</i>
) over the Lake, an Eastern Kingbird (<i>Tyranus</i>
<i>tyranus</i>) and numerous droppings of
Canada Geese (<i>Branta canadensis</i>) .
<p> At the east end of the dam, immediately west of the
spillway, there is a stand of very large White Pine, some 40 inches ( one m )
dbh. In association were a few Black Birch, Red Maple, Sugar Maple saplings and
Hophornbeam. A common shrub here was Early Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium angustifolium</i>) , a northerner, and in some places Upland
Low Blueberry as well. Ground cover included Ground Berry (<i>Rubus hispidus</i>) , Canada Mayflower, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain,
Fly Poison, Partridge Berry, the rush <i>Juncus
effuse</i>s, New York and Hay-scented Ferns. Beaver sign abounded .
<p> On crossing the spillway we entered once more a
forest of large White Pine and White Oak. As we continued north along the east
shore, we successively noted the following: the calls of Scarlet Tanager and
Red-eyed Vireo, more large White Pine, large Scarlet Oak, then Sugar Maple,
more White Oak and a dense growth of the sedge <i>Carex pensylvanica</i>. Following were Hog Peanut ( the first seen by
us in the area ), White Snakeroot, Hairy Sweet Cicely, and along a springbrook,
the two spinulose shield ferns <i>Dryopteris</i>
<i>intermedia</i> and the deciduous <i>D.
carthusiana</i> as well as Spiked
Lobelia (<i>Lobelia spicata</i>) in bloom.
<p> We now entered an area of small White Pine, perhaps
the site of a former field. Here vigorous ground-dwelling mosses included <i>Dicranum</i> and <i>Pleurosium schreberi</i> and were associated with <i>Cladina</i> 
lichen, a <i>Galerina </i>fungus and
Creeping Five-leaf under pine.
<p> Farther along the Trail we saw Rattlesnake Fern,
White Pine, White Oak and more emerging dragon flies along the shore, then the
first Pitch Pine, the fungus <i>Amanita
flavoconia</i>, Black Huckleberry, Upland Low Blueberry and suddenly, abundant
Ground Pine. Continuing, there was <i>Leucobryum</i> cushion moss, Deer Berry, Interrupted Fern
and abundant Rattlesnake Weed. Hearing the call of an Ovenbird, we entered an
area of concentrated Black Huckleberry, more Pitch Pine, <i>Calamagrostis porteri</i> and
in the Lake's shallows, Three-way Sedge. As elsewhere, yellow clay formed the
Lake bank and bottom.
<p> We soon came to another springbrook, noting that
where it entered the Lake there were large beds of <i>Sphagnum</i> moss and Three-way
Sedge, and on the near bank, Fly Poison and the only Mountain Aster (<i>Aster acuminatus</i>) seen on either
traverse. As we continued along the trail edged by the northern blue grass <i>Poa alsodes</i>,, now filling its seeds, a
Scarlet Tanager called again. Following these were abundant Ground Pine,
Intermediate Shield and Hay-scented Ferns and a few plants of Downy Rattlesnake
Plantain, while in an adjacent small embayment, a Spring Peeper called briefly,
although it was near mid-day. Not far beyond there was stunted Christmas Fern (
<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>) and, in
yet another springbrook, the manna grass <i>Glyceria
melicaria</i> and on its edge,
Interrupted and Royal (<i>Osmunda regalis</i>
) Ferns. Under adjacent large White Pine, White and Scarlet Oaks were Teaberry,
Rattlesnake Weed, Trailing Arbutus, the wood rush <i>Luzula echinata</i>, cushions of <i>Leucobryum</i> moss, <i>Cladina</i> lichen and a single plant of Creeping Phlox
(<i>Phlox stolonifera</i>) in bloom. Also
seen here was a single plant of Heartleaf in association with the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>. Red-eyed Vireos
and Chickadees of an unidentified species also called here.
<p> Not far distant in the forest interior we saw a few
large clumps of Great Rhododendron, the only example of this species seen on
either traverse. Also noted at the forest edge was the only example of the
sedge <i>Carex intumescens </i> seen by us.
<p> The canopy now consisted of abundant Pitch Pine
accompanied by White Pine, White Oak and Red Maple with diseased Flowering
Dogwood in the understory.A Scarlet Tanager and an Ovenbird called, and from
the Lake,were joined by a Green Frog. As we approached the head of the Lake we
identified the first-seen shrub of Maleberry (<i>Lyonia</i> <i>ligustrina</i>) .
<p> Our completion of the circuit on the west side of the
Lake was rapid and included few observations, since this side is developed for
camping. Seen however were Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia
pilosa</i>) , Maleberry, an isolated occurrence of Wild Comfrey (<i>Cynoglossum virginianum</i>) , perhaps
related to introduced nutrients, more Northern Bedstraw, our first Poverty Oat
Grass (<i>Danthonia spicata</i>) , Smooth
Alder, Beaked Hazelnut (<i>Corylus cornuta</i>) ,
Swamp Candles (<i>Lysimachia terrestris</i>
) and the Broad-leaf Cattail (<i>Typha</i> <i>latifolia</i>) . Obvious also on this side
of the Lake was the replacement of Scarlet Tanagers by American Robins (<i>Turdus migratorius</i>) , a tolerator of
human-induced degradation. While it is likely that the Lake shore would have
added many more species to our tally, many of these would also be a consequence
of human disturbance.
<p> The following are additional fungi identified by R.
Hunsucker from collections along the Lake Sherwood Trail:
<p> <i>Clitocybe</i>
sp- on ground
<br> <i>Dacrymyces
palmatus</i>-on Pitch Pine down bole
<br> <i>Tremellodendron
pallidum</i>- on ground in mixed woods
<br> <i>Collybia
confluens</i>-on ground in mixed woods
<br><i>Leucopaxillus
albissimus</i>-on hardwood and conifer leaves
<br> <i>Cantharellus
minor</i>-among <i>Climacium americanum</i> in mixed woods
<br><i>Tremella
mesenterica</i>-on dead hardwood branches
<br> <i>Tricholomopsis
platyphylla</i>-on rotting down trees
<br><i>Suillus
granulatus</i>-on soil under White Pine, its favorite habitat
<br> <i>Cryptoporus
volvatus</i>-on trunk of dead standing Pitch Pine
<br> <i>Tylopilus
indecisus</i>-on ground in oak-Red Maple-White Pine forest
<br> <i>Spathularia
velutipes</i>
<br> <i>Marasmius
siccus</i>-on ground in mixed forest
<br> <i>Galerina</i>

<p> <b>Summary</b>
<ul>
<p> 
<p> Among the markedly northern species identified on
these traverses are Early Low Blueberry, Beaked Hazelnut, Canada Mayflower,
Wild Sarsaparilla , Large Round-leaved Orchid, Mountain Aster and Northern
Bedstraw. All have very limited
occurrences, appearing almost as curiosities and likely related to very local
conditions. As previously indicated for the lower watershed, this is an
expected consequence of the modest elevation and the lack of nearby high slopes
that might serve as sources of cold air to drain into the area. It seems likely
that the presence of certain species, such as Northern Bedstraw near the Lake
shore may be related to the cooling effect of the water during the early part
of the growing season.
