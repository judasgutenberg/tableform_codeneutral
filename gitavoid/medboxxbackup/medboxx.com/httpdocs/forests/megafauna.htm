<p>Wander
from the sea coast to the Appalachian crest - indeed almost anywhere
in the Eastern US -  and you will meet a familiar tribe - the
hawthorns. Although most concentrated in Eastern North America, with
more than 100 species, the genus <i>Crataegus</i> is found throughout
the north temperate zone and many mountain ranges in the southern
part of the continent. Small trees, or frequently only brush - sized,
the hawthorns catch our eye with their hedge - shaped arboreal forms,
heavy autumn crops of conspicuously - colored fruit and, above all,
their formidable armament of long, sharp thorns.</p>

<p>The
thorns of  hawthorns are clearly intended to fend off browsers, who
find both leaves and fruit highly desirable. Other plants in the rose
family, of which the hawthorn genus is a member, are similarly
desired. But what do the thorns fend off? Almost the only native
browser in the Eastern United States in modern times, and for that
matter during the entire Holocene Epoch, is and was the White -
tailed Deer. The only other browser, the Moose, was confined to
northern bog areas, and though Elk and Bison were present in the
historical period, they are primarily grazers. Smaller browsers such
as deer and domestic goats, are not stopped by large thorns, since
they easily reach between them. These thorns, which in Cockspur
Hawthorn  (<i>Crataegus  crus - galli</i>)  reach 5 inches in length,
were evolved to protect the plant from large browsers.</p>
<p>	To
find these large browsers we must look in the fossil record, back
12,000 - 15,000 years during the late Pleistocene, when an impressive
megafauna ranged the land. According to John Guilday  (<i>Quaternary
Extinctions, A</i> <i>Prehistoric Revolution</i>, Paul S. Martin and
Richard G. Klein editors, U of AZ Press, 1984)  these large browsers
included the Mastodon  (<i>Mamut  americanum</i>),  Jefferson Ground
Sloth  (<i>Megalonyx  jeffersoni</i>),  Harlans Ground Sloth (
<i>Glossotherium  harlani</i>)  and the Stag Moose  (<i>Cevalces
scotti</i>).  In addition two mammoths  (<i>Mamuthus</i>)  and a
horse   (<i>Equs  complicatus</i>)  probably browsed some. Other
browsers larger than the White - tail included a tapir, a large
peccary, and Caribou.</p>
<p>	The
browsing habits of these larger animals must have been quite
different from those of the delicate - muzzled deer. It seems likely
that they would have broken off whole branches or engulfed entire
branch ends, stripping off the leaves and small twigs, as existing
elephants do. Feeding leaf by leaf as deer and goats do would not
have satisfied their enormous intake requirements. With these
aggressive browsers the long thorns would have been the perfect
counterpoise to maintain a balance between the eaters and the eaten.
The hawthorns even went so far as to protect themselves from possible
assaults on their nutritious inner bark by evolving &quot;monkey
puzzles&quot; of large complex thorn growths on their trunks.</p>
<p>	If
thorns were so effective in deterring browsers, why didn't more of
the hundreds of other tree species in North America evolve them? The
answer to this is complex and probably will never be completely
known. However, as indicated previously, many members of the rose
family seem to be particularly attractive to browsers. Also, it is
likely that many other species found it more economical to invest
their energy and nutrients in chemical defenses.</p>
<p>	Several
other members of the rose family do have thorns for defense. An
example is the Wild Crab Apple  (<i>Pyrus </i> <i>coronaria </i>),
which is almost as well defended as the hawthorns. Another is the
Wild Plum, though its thorns are less impressive. Additionally,
thorns are prevalent in the legume family. In the Eastern US the
thorny legumes include the Black Locust  (<i>Robinia</i> 
<i>pseudoacacia</i>)  and the Honey Locust   (<i>Gleditsia 
tricanthos</i>).  The latter has impressive thorns on both branches
and trunk.</p>
<p>	Another
factor governing the development of thorn protection is habitat.
Evidence indicates that, by and large, the megafauna occupied open
savannas and spruce - pine - shrub parkland rather than deep forests.
This open country would probably also have been the preferred
location for hawthorns, crab apples, plums and locusts because all
are intolerant of shade and today are more at home in forest edges
and clearings than in deep woods. At present we can see hawthorns
flourishing in openings of montane Red Spruce forests of the high
Alleghenies, a habitat that approaches that inferred for the
Pleistocene mastodon. Species of maple, oak and other components of
the great mixed deciduous forest would have been exposed to heavy
browsing only at forest edges since forest interior habitat would not
have been favored by the megafauna. Finally, many plants may not have
adequate genetic resources to evolve them.</p>
<p>	Clearly,
the hawthorns, Honey Locust and other heavily - thorned plants are
relics of another time and most significantly of a fauna long
vanished. This fauna became extinct approximately 10,000 - 11,000
years ago, a time span apparently sufficiently short for the thorns
to persist. There simply have not been enough generations of trees
since the Pleistocene to breed out a feature so beneficial when large
browsers were around. Also, there is probably some residual benefit
in the thorns, since they do slow even small browsers. However, the
thorns represent a considerable investment in energy and nutrients,
and one would expect them to gradually disappear or be replaced by
smaller thorns.</p>
<p>	Very
likely, thorns are not the only persisting relics of the megafauna.
They are simply the most visible. There may be a host of chemical
repellants that are specific for mastodon, ground sloth and other
megafaunal browsing niches and have not yet vanished. The same may be
said of fruit and seeds designed to be dispersed by the megafauna. An
example of a fruit may be that of the thorn - bearing Osage Orange (
<i>Maclura  pomifera</i>),  which is at present consumed by horses
but not by cattle, and would probably have also appealed to
Pleistocene horses and other megafauna  (Gus Mueller, personal
communication).  Even form and growth habits of trees and bushes were
probably sensitive to influences of the great browsers.</p>
<p>
The thorn plants we see today are graphic reminders of
how much the planet has lost since the Pleistocene. They are 
messengers
 from the grand age of wilderness that for some unknown reason
underwent a transformation at the beginning of the Holocene, but
still retained its ecological integrity until European man began to
destroy it. The megafaunal browsers can be regarded as predators of a
type, albeit of plants. Like their legacy of thorny plants, existing
ecosystems are part of the preexisting complex of predator - prey
relationships. Although the most important large predators of the
Holocene have been extirpated in the Eastern US, the &quot;ghosts&quot;
of these predators haunt us by the wild characteristics we so admire
in their remaining prey fauna - the fleetness of the deer and the
craftiness and stealth of smaller herbivores and carnivores that were
hunted by them. The absence of the large carnivores has thrown these
ecosystems out of balance. The small carnivores, the Raccoon, the
Opossum, skunks and foxes, have increased in numbers to where they
contribute significantly to the decline of many birds and other prey.
Also, it is likely that some endemic plants have been brought to
extinction by the over abundant deer which leave high browse lines on
trees in many areas. The sum of these effects is genetic
deterioration, loss of species diversity and general environmental
degradation. What began as perhaps a &quot;normal&quot; ecosystem
transformation at the end of the Pleistocene has turned to pervasive
decline heading toward collapse. 
</p>
<p>	We
can't bring back the thorn - molding megafauna, but we can and must
bring back the assemblage of  Wolves, Panthers, Wolverines and large
raptorial birds that form the peak of the trophic pyramid and are
needed to balance the system. We must also try to bring back the
large ungulates, the Elk and Bison, to reclaim their important
niches. More than an atavistic wish, this restoration of the rightful
heirs to the land is an ecological imperative that is gaining
credence with each passing day as our dependence on nature and
ecosystems becomes more evident.</p>
