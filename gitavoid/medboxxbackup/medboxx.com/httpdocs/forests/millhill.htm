<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<p>Mill Hill is a half mile (0.8 km) 
long, tadpole-shaped hill with a N-S orientation. Elevations range from 1550 to
1850 feet (473 to 564 m) asl. It is
cut off from the southwest end of Bolar Mountain by Mill Creek (see <a href=bolar.htm>our
section on Bolar Mountain</a>), and the waters of the Lake Moomaw impoundment abut
it on the east. The Hill is along the strike from Blowing Springs (see <a href=blows.htm>our
section</a> on the latter) and is underlain by the same Upper Silurian/ Lower
Devonian lithology (Rader and Evans,
1993) . This lithology is complex and includes shales, which are exposed at the
Hill base, limestones and sandstones. It is likely that the latter, as the most
erosion resistant type, form the Hill's crest. Of particular interest are
calcareous sandstones, in which silica grains are cemented by calcium
carbonate, and which may give rise to substrates for plants much like those
derived from limestone. Since these rocks are highly deformed the same rock
type may appear in different relations to other rock types.
<p> 
</ul>
<h2>Source Walk: 5-14-01</h2>
<ul> Our
inventory traverse began at near 1:00 PM at the Hill's northwest base on a
bordering road. After a short climb to the top of the defining spur, it
extended south along the spur top to the broadened summit. From there it curved
southwest to the bordering road again, and along this road to the point of origin.
The weather was sunny, bright and cool.
<p> After
identifying a Parula Warbler (<i>Parula 
americanus</i>) near the junction with Route 600, we began our ascent
of the northwest side of the spur. The forest canopy here consisted or almost
pure Canada Hemlock (<i>Tsuga 
canadensis</i>), with trees mostly in the range of 10 inches (0.25 m) 
dbh and much defoliated by the Adelgid. Ground flora was sparse, but included
Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia 
punctilobula</i>), Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>), the forest sedge <i>Carex platyphylla</i>, Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila maculata</i>) and the mosses <i>Leucobryum glaucum, Aulocomnium</i> <i>heterostichum</i> and an unidentified<i>
Hypnum</i>. Also conspicuous were Deer-browsed sprouts of Black Birch (<i>Betula lenta</i>) .
<p> A soil sample
 (1) was taken from a depth of 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) under Hemlock on a gentle
slope with a west aspect. This sample had an initial pH of 4.3 and 24 hours
later one of 4.4. A soil temperature determination (T-60) (1) was also made at
the conventional depth of 5 inches (13 cm) . This temperature proved to be
quite low at T= 11.0 deg. C. We now began our ascent to the northern part of
the spur crest, noting a 9 inch (23 cm) dbh Black Birch and mature Red Maple
(<i>Acer rubrum</i>) as minor
components of the dominantly Hemlock canopy. The understory consisted almost
solely of Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus 
florida</i>), some of which was infected by Anthracnose (<i>Discula destructiva</i>) .
<p> Now, having
reached the spur crest, we advanced south along it, noting that the limited
exposed rock was indeed sandstone, likely with silica-cemented grains. Soon
added to our tally were Tuliptree (<i>Liriodendron tulipifera </i>), large
Northern Red Oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>), Chestnut Oak (<i>Q. prinus </i>) and Black Gum (<i>Nyssa 
sylvatica</i>) which bore on its base the moss <i>Anomodon attenuatus</i>. Here also we heard the song
of a Scarlet Tanager (<i>Piranga 
olivacea</i>) .
<p> Many trees
now bore evidence of fire in the form of blackened and scarred bases and were
accompanied as well by partially burned dead wood on the forest floor.
<p> Next seen
on our ascent along the spur crest were Scarlet Oak (<i>Quercus coccinea</i>) and down wood of the American
Chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>) .
We also now began to see seedlings of Sugar Maple (<i>Acer saccharum</i>) as well as some identified
by R. Hunsucker as those of Black Maple (<i>A. nigrum</i>) . Given the unsuitable habitat for the latter
tree on this dry, acidic spur, some
skepticism was voiced by this reporter. However the question was soon to be
resolved in Dr Hunsucker's favor.
<p> Continuing
along the spur, we next saw Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia sessilifolia</i>), a large Black Locust (<i>
Robinia pseudoacacia</i>), Cancerroot
(<i>Conopholis</i> <i>americana</i>), 
upland Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium 
pallidum</i>), a large Cucumbertree (<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>) ; then Mountain Bellwort (<i>Uvularia pudica</i>), the sedge<i>Carex pensylvanica </i>, Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i>) and a foot (0.3 m) dbh
Shagbark Hickory (<i> Carya ovata</i>) .
<p> Farther
along we noted an apparent increase in the number of Black Maple seedlings,
then abundant young Hemlock. We now became aware of a much denser ground
flora immediately down-slope to the east, perhaps marking an exposed stratum of
more nutrient-rich rock there. Here also we began to see, on the forest floor,
tunnels of a wood vole, possibly those of the Pine Vole (<i>Pitymys pinetorum</i>) .
<p> Moving
onward, we saw isolated clumps of Kentucky Bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>) and <i>Carex digitalis</i>; then quite abruptly,
scattered Wild Comfrey (<i>Cynoglossum</i> 
<i>virginianum</i>), which is usually an indicator of nutrient-rich
soils.
<p> As the spur
top now broadened, we saw the first White Oak (<i>Quercus alba</i>), Shagbark Hickory (<i>Carya ovata</i>), a shrub layer of the alien
Autumn olive (<i>Elaeagnus umbellata</i>
) with Canada Bluegrass ( <i>Poa compressa</i> ) and<i>Carex rosea</i>
in the ground cover.
<p> There was
now a relatively sharp transformation in the forest canopy, with Hemlock almost
entirely replaced by hardwoods. Also, the ground flora was far denser than
under Hemlock. A first appearance was made by May Apple (<i>Podophyllum peltatum</i>) in association with White
Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium</i> <i> rugosum</i>), Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia quadrifolia</i>) and<i>Carex amphibola</i> – all under White and Black
Oak (<i>Quercus velutina</i>), 
Tuliptree and an unidentified species of Pignut Hickory. Also present were some
large and apparently healthy flowering Dogwood.
<p> The soil at
this point, on a very gentle north slope, appeared sandy, rich in organic
matter and quite moist, but appeared to be a semi-mor. A sample (2), taken
from a depth of 2-3 inches, had an initial pH value 4.6, and 24 hours later it
was still 4.5. A soil temperature reading at a 5 inch depth (T-61) yielded
T=13.5 deg. C.
<p> Now moving
over the gently-sloping, greatly broadened summit area, we observed in
succession the hawthorn <i>Crataegus 
macrsperma, Carex hirtifolia</i>,
blooming Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis stricta</i>), abundant Wild Comfrey, Nodding fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>), Indian Tobacco (<i>Lobelia inflata</i>), Canada Brome Grass ( <i>Bromus</i> <i>pubescens</i>), a wedge grass (<i>Sphenopholis</i> sp), Scarlet Oak., a fungus of the genus <i>Peziza,</i>
Northern Red Oak, the first Black Cohosh 
(<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>) 
and Clasping- leaved Dogbane (<i>Apocynum 
sibericum</i>) . These were followed by the forest grass<i>
Brachyelytrum erectum</i>,
Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium 
triflorum</i>), a 5 inch (0.13 m) dbh sapling of Mockernut Hickory (<i>Carya tomentosa</i>) and a foot (0.3 m) dbh Red
Hickory (<i>Carya ovalis</i>) . In
association were large, thick grape vines, some of which were Summer Grape (<i>
Vitis aestivalis</i>) .Next seen was
the rich-soil indicator Cut-leaf Toothwort (<i>Dentaria laciniata</i>), here with Hog Peanut (A<i>mphicarpa bracteata</i> ), Palmate-leaf Violet (<i>Viola palmata</i>) and Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium</i> <i> virginianum</i>) . Curiously also, we here
found Marsh Blue Violet (<i>Viola 
cucullata</i>), by any means an indicator of moist growing conditions.
We then also began to see Slender-flowered Muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia tenuiflora</i>) and noted that the largest
trees were near 20 inches (0.5 m) dbh. A faunal element here was a Spring
Peeper (<i>Pseudacris crucifer</i>) among leaves of the forest
floor. Following this frog were the forest bluegrass <i>Poa alsodes,</i> Stickseed (<i>Hackelia virginiana</i>), Enchanter's Nightshade (<i>Circaea quadrisulcata</i>), a false buckwheat (
likely <i>Polygonum scandens</i>), 
Virginia Spring Beauty (<i>Claytonia virginica</i>) in bloom, Nimblewill (<i>Muhlenbergia schreberi</i>), Christmas Fern,<i>Carex laxiflora</i>, Bottlebrush Grass (<i>Elymus hystrix</i>) and Black Walnut (<i>Juglans nigra</i>) with more Spring Beauty at its base. A little up-slope
were <i>Carex blanda,</i> abundant
Autumn Olive, Black oak, <i>Carex 
amphibola</i> and Ebony Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium platyneuron</i>) .
<p> We had now
reached the highest point of the Hill, where, among a few outcrops of
sandstone, stood magnificent White Ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>), Pignut Hickory (<i>Carya glabra</i>) and Black Oak (<i>Quercus velutina</i>), with a ground cover that
included Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema 
triphyllum</i>), Maidenhair Fern (<i>Adiantum pedatum</i>) and Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>) .
<p> Soils here
appear to be generally moist. A sample (3) was taken from a 2-3 inch depth at
the highest point on a nearly flat aspect. This soil had a low density as a
result of a high percentage of organic matter, was moist and almost black in
color. However, it contained many small rock fragments. An initial pH value of
5.2 was obtained for this soil, but after 24 hours this had increased to 6.2,
perhaps as a result of included carbonate fragments. The soil temperature (
T-62) taken at a 5 inch depth was T=12.5 deg C. Immediately down- slope to the
southeast of the highest point we saw a large (20 inch / 0.5 m) dbh
multistemmed White Basswood (<i>Tilia 
heterophylla</i>), Black Oak and Black Maple, with the latter the
likely source of the seedlings first identified by R. Hunsucker along the spur
to the north. Also present down –slope were young Tuliptree and a dense ground
cover dominated by sedges that included<i>Carex canoidea, C</i>. <i>digitalis,
C laxiflora, C</i>.. <i> communis, C. 
platyphylla</i>, <i>C. 
pensylvanica </i>and <i>C</i>. <i>cephalophora</i>.
Other species noted on this slope were Redbud (<i>Cercis canadensis</i>), Cleavers (<i>Galium aperine</i>), Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>), a little Intermediate Shield
Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>), 
Smooth Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza 
longistylis</i>), Wild Liquorice (<i>Galium circaezans</i>), the grass <i>Brchyelytrum erectum</i>, abundant Black Cohosh and the
edible fungus <i>Tricholomopsis platyphylla
</i> (&quot;Platterfull&quot;) . Both 
seedlings and saplings, as well as large trees of Black Maple were
common. In one case a large Black Maple extended its roots into an ash gray
&quot;rotten&quot; sandstone which effervesced to acid, and thus proved to be
calcareous. The base of this tree, as well as others, showed evidence of fire
in the form of blackening and scarring, and were accompanied by partially
burned down wood. It should also be mentioned that the leaves of some Maples
here bore resemblances to those of both Sugar and Black Maples.
<p> Somewhat
farther down-slope than our survey extended, the Virginia Natural Heritage
Program established a test plot (Fleming, 1999), their number FS42. Some
additional Species recorded by them in this plot were Slippery Elm ( <i>Ulmus 
rubra</i>), Bitternut Hickory (<i>Carya cordiformis</i>), Tall Bellflower (<i>Campnula americana), </i>Hackberry (<i>Celtis</i> <i>occidentalis</i>), Twingrass (<i>Diarrhina americana</i>), Virginia Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum</i> <i>virginianum</i>), Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>) and American Gromwell (<i>Lithospermum</i> <i>latifolium</i>) . However they found
neither Black Maple, Basswood, Black Walnut nor many of the herbs recorded by
us for the upper slope. An analysis of a composite soil sample for this plot
was high in calcium and had pH=6.5.
<p> We now
began to circle southwest toward the road, successively noting Hispid
greenbrier (<i>Smilax hispida</i>), 
Starry Campion (<i>Silene stellata</i>) and Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus 
quinquefolia</i>) . Then among
the leaves of the forest floor we saw a small (1 inch/ 2.5 cm), very dark
American Toad (<i>Bufo americanus</i>) .
Following this were an unidentified <i>Atrichum</i> moss, Carolina Rose (<i>Rosa
carolina</i>) and, on a down bole, the edible Oyster Mushroom (<i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>) .
<p> Now,
descending the Hill and passing through a thicket of Autumn Olive that had
top-died but was resprouting, we saw large Poke (<i>Phytolacca americana</i>) . This was followed
down-slope by a thicket of Black Haw Viburnum (<i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>) . We then once more entered
the Hemlock forest, which showed considerable evidence of fire-as in other
areas- in the form of blackened and scarred tree bases and partially burned
down wood.
<p> As we
returned to our point of origin we heard the calls of Pileated (<i>Dryocopus</i> <i>pileatus</i>) and Hairy (<i>Picoides villosus</i>) Woodpeckers. 
<p> Additional
mosses from this traverse identified by R. Hunsucker are as follows:
<br><i>Anomodon 
rostratus –</i> on bases of hardwoods, rotting down boles
<br><i>Anomodon 
attenuatus –</i> on bases of trees, rocks
<br><i>Campylium 
hispidulum – </i>on bases of hardwoods
<br><i>Dicranum fulvum –
</i>on rocks
<br><i>Entodon cladorrhizans</i> – on bases of hardwoods, rotting down boles 
<br><i>Eurhynchium hians
– </i>on soil in deciduous forest
<br><i>Fissidens 
subbasilaris – </i>onbases of hardwoods
<br><i>Hypnum </i> sp –
on rotting down boles, bases of trees 
<br><i>Mnium cuspidatum – on rotting down boles, bases of trees</i>
<br><i>Plagiothecium 
laetum – </i>on rotting down boles in Hemlock forest 
<br><i>Platygyrium 
repens –</i> on rotting down boles
 
<p> The
occurrence of Black Maple here exhibits relations to the substrate which are in
harmony with its conditions of inferred stability. The close relation between
mature trees as well as seedlings and saplings and the calcareous sandstone is
compatible with a stability field in the slightly acid to alkaline range as
observed elsewhere. The occurrence of its seedlings, likely dispersed down
wind, in the Hemlock forest, home to a
number of acidiphiles such as Chestnut Oak and blueberries, is an interesting
illustration of the phenomenon of the expanded – albeit temporary – stability
field of seedlings relative to that of mature trees (Mueller, 2000) . Of
course, the trees which gave rise to the leaves that appear intermediate
between Black and Sugar Maples, may also be expected to have expanded fields of
occurrence relative to pure members of these species – or varieties, as some
believe. The stability relations of 
other species such as Red Maple, Chestnut Oak, White Ash and a number of
the herbs should also be kept in mind
when interpreting the communities observed here. Finally, the observed
relatively moist conditions on the summit of this ridge pose a caution to
the blanket application of so-called
&quot; moisture indexes &quot;, which automatically attribute low moisture
values to ridge tops, and fail to take account of the common intersection
of moisture bearing rock units such as
porous sandstone or limestone on slopes.
