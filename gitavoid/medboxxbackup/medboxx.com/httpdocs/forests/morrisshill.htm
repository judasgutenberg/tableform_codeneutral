<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<p> Morris Hill
is a 650 foot (198 m)-high, elongate hill with a northeast – southwest
orientation. Elevations range from 1400
to 2050 feet (427 to 625 m) asl. The hill is bordered on the southeast by the
Jackson River flood plain and on the northwest in part by the Lake Moomaw
impoundment. Bedrock is the Upper Silurian / Lower Devonian complex of shales,
sandstones and limestones that occur widely throughout the region (see <a href=blows.htm>our
section on Blowing Springs</a>) (Rader and Evans, 1993). As expected, the Hill
crest is dominated – at least in exposures – by resistant sandstone members.
However, there is ample evidence, in the form of sinkholes aligned along the
crest, and outcrops as well as vegetation types on the slope below the crest,
that carbonate rocks (limestones or dolomites) form part of the Hill's
lithology.
<p> The part of
the Hill on which our inventories were concentrated has either gentle slopes or
southeast aspects for the most part. The forest canopy throughout the area is
dominantly mixed oak, young but mature and of uneven age in character. The most
common tree appears to be Black Oak (<i>Quercus velutina</i>) as indicated by the forest floor leaf mat. It is
followed by Chestnut Oak (<i>Q. prinus</i>
), Scarlet Oak (<i>Q. coccinea</i>), 
White Oak (<i>Q. alba </i>), Red Maple (<i>Acer rubrum </i>), Black gum (<i>Nyssa 
sylvatica </i>), scattered
Mockernut and pignut Hickories  (<i>Caya tomentosa</i> and <i>C. glabra </i>), Sassafras (<i>Sassafra 
albidum), </i>Black Cherry (<i>Prunus 
serotina </i>), black Locust
  (<i>Robinia pseudoacacia </i>) and a
very few White Pine  (<i>Pinus strobus </i>) . Some measured dbh values in inches (meters) were as follows:
Black Oak 18 (0.46 m), Scarlet Oak 16 (0.41 m), Chestnut Oak 15 (0.38), 17
 (0. 43) .
<p> The canopy
is quite thin, allowing considerable sunlight to reach the forest floor
throughout the day. As a result there is a heavy undergrowth of woody plants in
particular. The largest of this undergrowth was dominated by anthracnose –
infected Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus 
florida</i>), with less abundant Downy Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier arborea</i>), Witch Hazel  (<i>Hamamelis virginiana </i>), 
saplings of the oaks, Red Maple, American Chestnut  (<i>Castanea dentata</i>) 
sprouts, Black Gum, Black Cherry and White Pine.
<p> The forest
floor bears a very heavy leaf mat, 
which contributes to the dominance also of woody species in the low ground cover.
These include Upland Low Blueberry  (<i>Vaccinium pallidum 
</i>), a little Deer Berry (<i>V. 
stamineum </i>), Witch Hazel,
Pinxter Azalea  (<i>Rhododendron nudiflorum 
</i>)., Corymbose Spiraea 
  (<i>Spiraea corymbosa 
</i>), as well as many seedlings of Red Maple, Black Gum, Sassafras,
azalea and less of oaks and hickories.
While herbs were scarce, Four- leaved Yam (
<i>Dioscorea quternata</i>) and
the tick trefoil <i>Desmodium 
nudiflorum </i>were fairly common. Others of rarer occurrence were Hairy
Angelica  (<i>Angelica veninosa </i>) the orchid Whorled Pogonia (
<i>Isotria verticillata </i>), Moccasin Flower (<i>Cypripedium acaule </i>), Indian Pipe  (<i>Monotropa uniflora </i>), Wreath
Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago caesia 
</i>), Calico Aster  (<i>Aster lateriflorus </i>), Mountain Bellwort (
<i>Uvularia pudica </i>), Poverty Oat Grass  (<i>Danthonia spicata </i>), Bracken
Fern  (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) and Smooth and Hairy Sweet
Cicelies  (<i>Osmorhiza longistylis </i>and <i>O. claytoni 
</i>) . As a consequence of the heavy leaf mat, many of the herbs as
well as bryophytes were concentrated at tree bases where they could also
benefit from the moisture and nutrients produced by trunk run-off. Additional
habitat for bryophytes was also provided by living tree trunks, down wood and
scattered sandstone blocks and outcrops. The most conspicuous bryophytes
observed were the mosses <i>Thuidium 
delicatulum, Dicranum scoparium </i>and<i>
Leucobryum glaucum. </i> While down boles bore a variety of
bryophytes, the degree of cover of these boles was patchy due to the dry
conditions in this forest. Fire scars were quite common, particularly on the
bases of the larger Black Gum.
<p> While the
described oak forest dominates on the Hill, other, more mesic forest types also
occur locally at lower elevations. Also encountered were small patches of mesic
ground flora within the oak forest. These will be described as observed on our
traverses.
<p> The most
conspicuous insect in the forest was the European Gypsy Moth  (<i>Lamantria dispar </i>) caterpillar,
which was up to several inches in length. At night the feeding of these
caterpillars, mostly on oaks, was evident in the constant rain of frass.
Although not comparable in numbers to those of the Gypsy Moth, the caterpillars
of the native Buck Moth  (<i>Hemileuca maia 
</i>) were encountered frequently enough to encourage caution regarding
their stinging spines. In fact, one of our party was afflicted severely by
contact with one. While generally insect life did not appear to be as
conspicuous in this dry oak forest as in more mesic forests, a third exception was the relatively common observation
of mating crane flies (Tipulidae ?) .
<p> Weather on
our stay was pleasant throughout, a little humid on 6-14-01, but then cooling.
Light winds and partly cloudy conditions prevailed.
<p> Three
inventory traverses were made: the first to the southeast down-slope to the
Jackson River flood plain, a distance of 0.3 mile (0.5 km), the second counterclockwise around the largest sink
hole on the Hill crest and a third to the shale bluffs at the base of nearby
Oliver Mountain.

<h2>Source Walks: 6 – 14 – 01 and 6 – 15 – 01</h2>
<ul>
<p>Our
first traverse began at about 11:00 AM on 6-14-01 on the Hill crest at near
2050 feet (625 m) asl. First noted immediately southeast of our camp site
were the canopy trees Black, White, Scarlet and Chestnut Oaks, Black locust,
the pignut <i>Carya glabra</i>,
Sassafras and Black Gum. Beneath these were Flowering dogwood and Upland Low
Blueberry. A Scarlet Tanager  (<i>Piranga olivacea 
</i>) and a Black-billed Cuckoo (
<i>Coccyzus erythropthalmus </i>) called nearby. Next tallied were
Whorled Pogonia, Pinxter Azalea, Four-leaved Yam, Red Maple, Hairy Sweet
Cicely, Moccasin Flower, Wreath Goldenrod and Calico Aster. Most of these herbs
were concentrated at tree bases. Following these we saw a cluster of small (~1
m tall) saplings of Sugar Maple  (<i>Acer saccharum 
</i>) and the only members of this species seen on our visit; then Black
Cherry, the tick trefoil <i>Desmodium 
nudiflorum</i>, Northern Dewberry (
<i>Rubus flagellaris </i>) and a single small Striped Maple
  (<i>Acer pensylvanicum </i>) – all
in a heavy leaf mat.
<p> Continuing,
now on a gentle slope, we noted in succession, Indian Pipe, the alien shrub
Autumn Olive  (<i>Elaeagnus umbellata</i>), Mountain Bellwort, Poverty
Oat Grass, a little Spotted Wintergreen (
<i>Chimaphila maculata </i>), very stunted Bracken Fern, Mockernut
Hickory, an unidentified Hawthorn 
  (<i>Crataegus </i> sp ), 
seedlings of White Pine, Maple-leaf Viburnum (
<i>Viburnum acerifolium </i>), Downy Serviceberry, Summer Grape
  (<i>Vitis aestivalis </i>) and
Black Haw Viburnum  (<i>V. prunifolium 
</i>).
<p> A soil
sample (# 1) was taken and a soil temperature determination (T- 104) was
made here. Soil taken from a 2-3 inch (5-8 cm) depth yielded an initial pH of
4.4, and after 24 hours, one of 4.5. This soil was a rocky, gray silt that
crumbled when dry. The soil temperature, taken at a 5 inch (13 cm) depth on a
flat aspect, was T= 16.5 deg C.
<p> Continuing
southeast down-slope, we saw Indian Cucumberroot  (<i>Medeola virginiana 
</i>), Bushy Panic Grass (<i> Panicum dichotomum </i>) ; then Allegheny Blackberry  (<i>Rubus 
allegheniensis </i>), 
Crooked-stem Aster  (<i>Aster prenanthoides </i>), Plume Lily  (<i>Smilacina racemosa 
</i>), an unidentified Gentian 
  (<i>Gentiana </i>sp 
), Canada Brome Grass  (<i>Bromus pubescens 
</i>), Saw Brier  (<i>Smilax glauca 
</i>), an unidentified bedstraw (
<i>Galium </i>sp ), Downy Rattlesnake Plantain  (<i>Goodyera 
pubescens </i>), 
anthracnose-infected Flowering dogwood and the alien bedstraw <i>Galium parisiense</i>. Here we also encountered
small stinging flies or &quot;punkies&quot; (Ceratopogonidae ) . These were followed by an unidentified
azalea  (<i>Rhododendron </i>sp), 
Wavy-leaf Aster  (<i>Aster 
undulatus </i>), Cancerroot  (<i>Conopholis americana </i>) and an 18 inch  (0.46 m) dbh Black Gum with a 
<p>basal fire scar.
<p> We now
crossed the main road that paralleled the
Hill. Below this road the slope steepened greatly and on this slope grew
abundant <i>Desmodium glutinosum,</i> a
tick trefoil<i></i>associated with nutrient-rich soils, as well as other mesic
herbs, the presence of which we at first attributed to &quot;road wash&quot;.
However, these did not diminish in abundance down-slope, where we successively
noted Virginia Snakeroot  (<i>Aristolochia serpentaria 
</i>), Palmate-leaved Violet  (<i>Viola palmata 
</i>) <i>,</i>Great Chickweed  (<i>Stellaria pubera 
</i>), Hog Peanut  (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata 
</i>), the grass <i>Panicum 
boscii, </i>Black Cohosh  (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa 
</i>), Wild Comfrey  (<i>Cynoglossum virginianum </i>), White Snakeroot  (<i>Eupatorium rugosum </i>) and Variable Panic Grass (
<i>Panicum commutatum </i>) .<i></i>
<p><i> </i>At
this point we came to a small outcrop of crystallized <i> </i>chert, which implied the presence of
carbonate rock (limestone or dolomite) in the vicinity, albeit not exposed.
This was succeeded by the forest bluegrass <i>Poa alsodes </i>and <i>Carex 
cephalophora</i> (a sedge usually confined to fertile soils) under a
canopy of White and Chestnut Oaks, abundant Black Gum and Mockernut Hickory
with an understory of Flowering Dogwood. Next seen were nodding fescue  (<i>Festuca 
obtusa</i>) <i>,</i> Mealy Bellwort (
<i>Uvularia perfoliata </i>), a Buck Moth caterpillar, a little Upland
Blueberry and, on a down bole tip-up mound, unidentified species of the mosses <i>Dicranella,
Atrichum</i> and<i>Polystichum,</i> as well as <i>Rhynchostegium serrulatum</i> and<i>Mnium cuspidatum</i>.<i></i>A mostly consumed (
likely by rodents ) red-capped mushroom
of the genus <i>Russula</i> lay nearby.<i></i>
<p> We now
arrived at a small opening densely occupied by herbs. These included the
grasses Nimblewill (<i>Muhlenbergia 
schreberi</i>), its congener Slender-flowered Muhly  (<i>M. 
tenuiflora</i>) and Nodding Fescue, the sedges <i>Carex cephalophora</i> and <i>C. radiata </i>, as well as Black Snakeroot (<i> Sanicula 
canadensis</i> ), <i>Desmodium glutinosum</i>, Sweet-scented Bedstraw
  (<i>Galium triflorum</i>) and Christmas fern (<i> Polystichum</i> acrostichoides ) . In
association were the alien Wine Berry (
<i>Rubus phoenicolasius</i> ), a few seedlings of Virginia Juniper (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>) and an unidentified fungus
of the genus <i>Mycena</i>. A Red eft of the Eastern Newt  (<i>Notophthalmus viridescens </i>) was
also seen here.<i> </i>
<p> It was
decided here to take a soil sample (# 2), as well as a temperature reading (
T-105) . The soil sample, a gray silt loam (no hard lumps on drying), taken
at the usual depth of 2-3 inches, had had an initial pH of 6.0, and after 24
hours, one of 6.9 The temperature reading at the conventional depth of 5
inches, on a gentle slope with a southeast aspect, yielded T= 17.5 deg C.
<p> A little
farther down-slope we noted the mosses <i>Hedwigia ciliata</i> and<i>Anomodon rostratus </i>on a sandstone outcrop. Here also there was a
stunted but blooming Showy orchid  (<i>Orchis spectabilis</i> ) with unhealthy-appearing, yellowish leaves. Next seen were the
grass <i>Panicum boscii</i>, seedlings
of Black Gum, a 3-inch (8 cm) dbh Butternut (<i>Juglans cinerea</i>) sapling, <i>Carex digitalis</i> and Upright yellow Wood Sorrel
(<i>Oxalis stricta</i> ) .
<p> A notable
feature of the forest here was the thinness of the leaf mat, given a canopy of
Black, Chestnut and White Oaks. However, the effect of the canopy may have been
moderated by the dense understory of Flowering Dogwood, a species whose leaves
are known to decay rapidly, and which may speed decay quite generally when
mixed with more resistant leaves such as those of the oaks.
<p>Continuing our descent down-slope,
we saw the wedge grass <i>Sphenopholis 
nitida</i>, a small patch of Spring Iris (<i>Iris verna</i>) and Black Cohosh. A
White-breasted Nuthatch  (<i>Sitta caroliensis</i>) was heard here. We then
came upon a small patch of Violet Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis violacea</i> ), which however, was not in bloom. In places Black Haw Viburnum
formed a dense shrub layer. Where it was more open, we next saw Red Maple, an
unidentified Mountain Mint  (<i>Pycnanthemum</i> sp 
), Spice Bush  (<i>Lindera benzoin</i> ), an unidentified Pussytoes (<i>Antennaria</i> sp 
), Golden Ragwort (<i> Senecio aureus</i> ) and the first occurrence of the forest grass<i>
Brachyelytrum erectum</i>.
<p>Then, on a dead lichen-covered
Flowering Dogwood there was an unusual slug, about 2.5 inches (6 cm) in
length. This slug was dark grayish – brown in color with darker brown spots.
<p>Still farther down-slope, we heard
a Great-crested Flycatcher  (<i>Myiarchus
 crinitus </i>), saw a little Spotted Wintergreen and the coastal plain azalea <i>Rhododendron canescens</i>, then noted the thin character
of the canopy and the abundance of Autumn Olive.
<p>The visible rock here was sandstone
and apparently not calcareous in nature. We now also saw our first Tuliptree
  (<i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i> ), a sapling, followed by the grasses<i>Panicum boscii,</i> Variable Panic Grass  (<i>P. 
commutatum </i> var <i>commutatum </i>), Bushy Panic Grass, Slender-flowered Muhly, <i>Brachyelytrum</i> <i>erectum</i>, Poverty Oat Grass and the
sedge <i>Carex laxiflora</i> – all
under a canopy of Chestnut and White Oaks and the pignut hickory <i>Carya glabra</i>.
<p>Progressing down-slope, we noted an
unidentified species of <i>Atrichum</i> moss, Saw Brier, a woodpecker, either
Hairy  (<i>Picoides vilosus </i>) or Red-bellied  (<i>Melanerpes
 carolinus </i>) drumming; then Ebony Spleenwort  (<i>Asplenium platyneuron</i> ), the call of a Scarlet Tanager and Wild Vetch  (<i>Vicia 
caroliniana </i>) .
<p>We now came upon a large Chestnut
Oak  (26 inches / 0.65 m dbh), under
which there was a 30 by 8 foot (9 by 2.5 m 
) patch of Black Huckleberry  (<i>Gaylussacia</i> <i>baccata</i> ) and strangely, only 10 feet (3 m) down-slope, two saplings
of the mesic shrub Paw Paw  (<i>Asimina 
triloba </i>) .
<p>Next seen, as we continued our
descent, was a patch of Hay-scented Fern (
<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula </i>) ; then more Saw Brier – under a canopy of
White, Chestnut and Black Oaks and Black Gum. A little beyond these we saw our
first White ash  (<i>Fraxinus americana </i>) in the form of seedlings, and accompanied by Maidenhair Fern
  (<i>Adiantum pedatum</i>) .
<p>As we approached the base of the
slope, several of our party began a return up-slope, while R. Hunsucker
continued to the edge of the Jackson River flood plain.
<p>The return up-slope was by a
different route than that of our descent and passed through considerable Black
Huckleberry, which appeared to be underlain by a clay-rich mor type soil. A
soil temperature reading (T-106) at the conventional depth of 5 inches,
yielded T= 18.5 deg C.
<p>Additional fungi collected from the
acidic forest on the upper slope and identified by R. Hunsucker are as follows:<i>
Pluteus cervinus, Lentinellus ursinus, Crucibulum</i> <i>leave</i> and <i>Rhodotus palmatus</i>
  (on down wood and very rare according
to Miller,1979) . Also seen on this slope was a Red Fox (<i>Vulpes fulva </i>), while Scarlet Tanager calls were almost incessant.
<p>An inventory conducted by R.
Hunsucker on the lower slope, where carbonate rock is exposed, yielded the
following: Redbud  (<i>Cercis canadensis </i>), Indian Turnip  (<i>Ariaema triphyllum </i>), Cucumbertree  (<i>Magnolia acuminata </i>), White Ash, Paw Paw, Black Maple  (<i>Acer</i> <i>nigrum </i>), Chinquapin Oak  (<i>Quercus muehlenbergii</i> ), Smooth Rockcress  (<i>Arabis laevigata </i>) in
seed, Black Haw Viburnum, Virginia Snakeroot, Bittersweet  (<i>Celastrus</i> <i>scandens</i> ), 
Pennsylvania Pellitory  (<i>Parietaria pensylvanica</i> ), Slippery Elm (<i> 
Ulmus</i> <i>rubra </i>), Twinleaf 
  (<i>Jeffersonia diphylla</i> ), Starry Campion (<i> Silene stellata </i>), Purple Cliffbrake  (<i>Pellaea 
atropupurea </i>), Common Many
Knees  (<i>Polygonatum biflorum </i>), Hispid Greenbrier  (<i>Smilax hispida</i> 
), <i>Carex platyphylla</i>,
Bloodroot (<i> Sanguinaria canadensis</i> ), Wild Liquorice  (<i>Galium circaezans </i>), Wild Ginger  (<i>Asarum canadense </i>), Fern-leaf Phacelia  (<i>Phacelia bipinnatifida</i> ), Heart-leaved Skullcap (
<i>Scutellaria ovata </i> var <i>versicolor
</i>), Rough Heuchera (<i>Heuchera </i>x<i> 
hispida</i> ), Blunt-lobed
Woodsia  (<i>Woodsia obtusa </i>), the alien Field Cress (
<i>Lepidium campestre </i>) and the calciphile sedge <i>Carex jamesii</i>.
<p>About 0.5 mile (0.8 km) to the
southwest of this calcareous community, the State Division of Natural Heritage
established a test plot (their FS1) (Fleming, 1999) at the same topographic
level and presumably on the same carbonate stratum. Additional species found by
them in this plot and its immediate vicinity were American Basswood  (<i>Tilia 
americana </i>), Bitternut
Hickory (<i> Carya cordiformis</i> ), Black Walnut (<i> Juglans nigra </i>), Hackberry  (<i>Celtis occidentalis </i>), Bladdernut  (<i>Staphyla trifolia </i>), Multiflora rose (<i> Rosa 
multiflora </i>), Broadleaved Waterleaf
(<i> Hydrophyllum canadense</i> ), Cleavers  (<i>Galium aperine</i> 
), False Mermaid Weed  (<i>Floerkea proserpinacoides</i> ), Spreading Chervil  (<i>Chaerophyllum procumbens</i> ), 
Squirrel Corn  (<i>Dicentra canadensis</i> ), Early Meadowrue (<i> Thalictrum dioicum</i> ), Virginia waterleaf  (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum </i>), Wild
Blue Phlox  (<i>Phlox divaricata </i>), the calciphile sedge <i>Carex 
albursina</i>, Clustered Snakeroot (
<i>Sanicula gregaria </i>), Tall Bellflower  (<i>Campanula americana </i>), <i>
Carex sparganioides</i>, the alien
Common Chickweed  (<i>Stellaria media </i>), Hairy Woodmint  (<i>Blephilia hirsuta </i>), Striped Violet  (<i>Viola striata </i>) and Sharp-lobe Hepatica (<i> Hepatica acutiloba </i>) . Eighteen mesic species found on our
traverse were not found in this plot or its immediate vicinity.
<p>Our 6 – 15 – 01 traverse around the
sinkhole began in mid-morning and extended counterclockwise from the east side,
First noted in the ericaceous oak forest was a fragment of an unidentified <i>Pseudevernia</i>
lichen that had fallen from the canopy. Generally however, macrolichens on tree trunks were quite sparse here.
Following this we recorded a 20 inch (0.5 m) dbh White Oak and, on a down
bole, the fungus <i>Marasmius rotula</i>
and the mosses <i>Platygyrium repens</i>
and an unidentified species of <i>Brachythecium</i>. Also present were Black
Oak and seedlings of Flowering Dogwood. Of special interest was the occurrence
of the two major species of tick trefoil (<i>Desmodium</i> ) . While <i>D. nudiflorum</i> and other acidiphiles such as Upland Low Blueberry
prevailed in the heavy leaf mat of the oak leaves, <i>D. glutinosum</i> was restricted to the
proximity of rotting down boles, so a steep gradient in pH appeared to exist
around at least some of the decaying wood. This inference was confirmed in one
case by taking a soil sample  (# 3 ), consisting mostly of coarse,
reddish-brown humus with little mineral matter, from the base of a completely
decayed stump, on which grew a large plant of D. glutinosum. The result was an initial pH of 6.4 for this sample,
and 24 hours later this had increased to pH= 7.6.
<p>Then moving northwest along the
sinkhole's upper slope, we noted Whorled Loosestrife  (<i>Lysimachia quadrifolia </i>) and a
23 inch (0.58 m) dbh Black Oak. As we reached the sinkhole's northwest side,
we became aware of numerous mesic herbs ranging down-slope from the campground
road, and at first attributed them to road wash. Black Cohosh and <i>Desmodium
glutinosum </i>dominated, but there were others such as Common Ground Cherry
  (<i>Physalis heterophylla</i> ) .
However, we soon noted that among these herbs were numerous decaying down boles
1 foot (0.3 m) or more in diameter and lying in one direction, as if the
product of a blow-down. Also observed here were fungi, mostly on down dead
wood, that included the edible<i>Pluteus admirabilis</i> and <i>P. 
cervinus</i> as well as<i>Sarcocypha 
coccinea </i> (Miller,1979), <i>Ustulina deusta </i> and an
unidentified<i>Mycena.</i>, mostly on down dead wood. The soil here is a gray
silt loam that formed no hard lumps on drying and appeared rich in organic matter.
It was surprisingly acid, with an initial pH value of 4.6 and the same 24 hours
later. This sample was not taken from a location in close proximity to any
particular plant.
<p>Of some interest was the frequently
heard song of the Kentucky Warbler  (<i>Oporonis formosus</i> ) in the vicinity of the sinkhole.
<p>As we continued along the west side
of the sinkhole, we successively tallied 
the Trail Rush  (<i>Juncus tenuis</i>), a Cucumbertree seedling, Hispid Greenbrier, Slender-flowered Muhly,
Palmate-leaved Violet  (<i>Vola palmata</i>), a fungus of the genus <i>Pezizia</i>, Lance-leaved Wild Liquorice
  (<i>Galium lanceolatum </i>), Hog
Peanut, a Tiger Swallowtail  (<i>Papilio glaucus</i>) Butterfly, a large dead Mockernut Hickory, the fungus <i>Xerula megalospora</i>; then Mealy Bellwort,
abundant Black Cohosh, more Hog Peanut, Wild Comfrey, <i>Carex pensylvanica</i>, fungi,that included the
edible but parasitic Honey Mushroom  (<i>Armillariella mellea</i>), <i>Cystoderma granulosum</i>
on soil, <i>Crepidotus applanatus</i>
on dead sticks, unidentified species of
<i>Pluteus </i>and <i>Psathyrella </i>and <i>Marasmius cohaerens </i>on decaying forest debris. On
a small down bole there was a fragrant millipede resembling <i>Sigmoria aberans</i> (Levi et al, 1968 ) and, following this, a small patch of New
York Fern  (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis</i> ) . It is interesting that while mesic herbs
prevailed on the western sinkhole slope, the canopy, as well as the down boles
were, as on the southeast slope inventoried previously, dominated by oaks.
<p>We had now almost circumvented the
sinkhole along its upper slope and again reached the ericaceous oak terrain.
Here we noted the fungus<i>Galiella 
rufa </i> (Miller,1979) on decayed hardwood sticks and, on rock, the
mosses <i>Dicranum scoparium </i>and <i>Leucobryum glaucum</i>.
<p>Additional fungi identified by R.
Hunsucker from this traverse were as follows:
<ul>
<br><i>Collybia 
dryophylla</i> – &quot;oak-loving Collybia&quot; under oak and pine
<br><i>Gaoderma 
applanatum</i> – on decaying hardwoods and on wounds of living trees
<br><i>Lentinellus 
omphalodes </i>– on soil or buried hardwoods
<br><i>Phellinis rimosa</i>
– parasitic on dying Black Locust
<br><i>Stereum ostea </i>–
 (false Turkeytail) on dead wood
<br><i>Trichaptum 
biforme</i> – on dead wood
<br><i>Xylaria 
polymorpha</i> – on dead wood
<p>
</ul>
 Additional
mosses identified from the sinkhole area by R. Hunsucker are the following:
<ul>
<p><i>Anomodon attenuatus
</i>– on bases of hardwoods
<br><i>Brachythecium 
curtum</i> – on rotting wood, bases of trees
<br><i>Campylium 
hispidulum</i> – on rotting hardwoods
<br><i>Clasmatodon 
parvulus</i> – on bark of hardwoods
<br><i>Hedwigia ciliata </i>–
on sandstone rock
<br><i>Hypnum </i> sp –
on rotting wood
<br><i>Leucodon julaceus</i>
– on rotting wood, bases of trees
<br><i>Mnium affine</i>
– on rotting wood
<br><i>Platygyrium 
repens </i>– on rotting wood, bark of hardwoods
<br><i>Pylaisiella 
selwynii</i> – on bark of Scarlet and Black Oaks
</ul>
<p> A rapid
foray made by R. Hunsucker to the shale slopes at the base of Oliver Mountain
disclosed the following vascular plants:

<p> A soil
sample (# 5), taken within the inventoried area at the base of Oliver
Mountain, consisted of dry, gray-brown mineral matter, with relatively un
-decayed organic matter. The initial pH value was 4.6, and 24 hours later it
was 4.4.
<p> Although
not observed in this brief survey, rare shale barren plants have been
documented in the vicinity (Fleming, 1999), Heading the list is the Federally
Endangered Shale Barren Rockcress (<i>Arabis 
serotina</i>) . Others are Kate's Mountain Clover  (<i>Trifolium virginicum </i>), 
Alleghany Plum (<i>Prunus 
alleghaniensis </i>) and
White-haired Leatherflower (<i>Clematis 
albicoma</i>) .A further discussion is provided by Belden <i>et</i> <i>al
</i> (1999) . Other rare plants are associated with underlying limestones (
Fleming, 1999) . These include American Gromwell (<i>Lithospermum latifolium</i>) and Great Indian Plantain (
<i>Cacalia muehlenbergii</i>) . It may
be noted that the latter plant has been observed by us at Blowing Springs and
Cranberry Glades.
<p> Both
Scarlet Tanagers and Yellow-billed Cuckoos (
<i>Coccyzus americanus</i> ) called frequently at camp and the former
was also heard after dark.. Kentucky Warblers were heard quite frequently as
well. Crows were common and a fox barked during the night.
<p> Some
salient features of this area are the following:1) the scarcity or virtual
absence of mesic canopy species such as White Ash, Sugar Maple and Tuliptree,
and the low frequency even of Red
Maple, 2) the local occurrence of mesic herbs under xeric oak canopy. It seems
likely that 1) is in part a consequence of the combination of dry and acid soil
conditions. A survey of the occurrences of these mesic species indicates that
conditions in the area are likely to lie outside their stability fields (
Mueller,2000), For example the stability field of White Ash is thought to
contract toward higher pH values as soil moisture decreases and those of Sugar
Maple and Tuliptree may be exceeded at the low moisture values, Another factor
that should be considered, however, is the heavy leaf mat which would not favor
the establishment of mesic species with
light seeds (Fowells, 1965) . The characteristic that such seeds are also
transported by winds, may be negated by
a lack of seed trees anywhere near.
<p> The
somewhat unusual occurrence of mesic herbs under a predominantly oak canopy is
probably a consequence of very local conditions favoring these herbs. One type
of such conditions is the apparently 
local occurrence near the surface of carbonate rock on the southeast
slope, as indicated by the presence of chert and higher pH values 
than elsewhere. Another type of occurrence is the association of these
herbs with decayed down boles within the sinkhole. Such examples fall under the
category of microhabitats. In the case of the association with rotting down
boles, the forest type had been established before the blow -downs, while the
carbonate exposures are too small to influence forest trees - with root systems
that may reach a hundred feet - as do 
the larger exposures near the base of the southeast slope. In any case,
the acidiphile canopy species such as Chestnut Oak and Red Maple, which may
occur in the vicinity of the mesic herbs, appear to have stability fields which
extend to near pH=6.0,while the herbs themselves are not strongly calciphile.
The stability fields of the <i>Desmodium</i> species are of interest because
they occur frequently in a variety of habitats and appear to overlap in the
moderate pH range, with <i>D</i>. <i>nudiflorum</i> and <i>D. glutinosum</i>
excluded at high and low pH values respectively.
