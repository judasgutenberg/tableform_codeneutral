<p><h1>Nimrod Hall Ridge and Vicinity</h1>
<b>April, 2001</b>

<blockquote>


<p><h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<p>In terms of geologic structure
Nimrod Hall Ridge consists of a local anticlinal flexure on a larger synclinal
structure that includes Rough Mountain immediately to the southeast and Beards
Mountain to the northwest  (Rader and Evans, 1993) . The Ridge, as well as the
regional structure, trends approximately N 45E. The Ridge's core is comprised
of borderline Upper Silurian/ Lower Devonian Helderberg and Cayuga Groups rocks
dominated by calcareous sandstone, limestone and chert. Overlying these rocks
stratigraphically is the Devonian Millboro Shale, which is black and fissle,
and above this the Braillier Formation, dominated by dark colored shales,
siltstones and sandstones. The Millboro and Braillier are largely confined to
lowlands northwest of the Ridge.
<p>Nimrod Hall Ridge rises to a little
over 1900 ft  (580 m)  asl, with a local relief of about 700 ft  (214 m)  and
at Crizer's Water Gap is cut by an unnamed stream that rises on Rough Mountain
and empties into the Cowpasture River just to the northwest. The Cowpasture
occupies a series of incised meanders, largely in Braillier Formation and is
bordered by flood plain &quot;bottom&quot; or low terraces as well as dissected
high terraces.
<p>The area is characterized by a wide
variety of macro and microhabitats, which follow from the great variety of rock
types, structures, topography and soils. The result is a correspondingly
complex flora and as yet little investigated fauna. It thus presents unusual
opportunities for proximity studies of juxtaposed plants and different rock
types, associated soils and topographic features. Our work in the area included
ten inventory traverses on 4-10-00, 4-23-00, 5-7-00, 5-14-00 and 5-22-00. As is
conventional in this work, both scientific and common names of species are
given on first mention and, with few exceptions, only common names thereafter.

<h2>Northwest Side of Crizer's Gap</h2>

<b>Source walks: 4-10-00, 5-14-00 and 5-22-00</b>
<ul>
<p> Crizer's
Gap is occupied by a small, deeply incised stream with small terraces at
different levels. Much of the cut bank in the Gap's northwest side is in
Millboro Shale, which is exposed at several locations but gives way to
limestone and sandstone a little upstream beyond the terraces. The terraces
appear to be occupied at least in part by poorly sorted coarse and fine alluvium
that may be related to catastrophic floods. The bedload of the stream appears
to consist largely of sandstone boulders and cobbles, with perhaps less than 5%
limestone. However, there appears to be sufficient limestone in the terrace
deposits to exert a strong influence on the flora. It is also possible and even
probable that some of this limestone is derived from gravels which form the bed
of the road that closely parallels the stream.
<p> The mixture
of sandstone and limestone in the alluvium has resulted in a corresponding
mixture of acidiphile and calciphile plants on the terraces. However,
acidiphiles appear to be most concentrated on the highest terrace, which also
shows signs of acid leaching. In places, where the floral mixture is most
pronounced, we must consider the possibility revealed by experiments  (Korner,
1999) , in which the roots of plants  (in that case sedges)  had been observed
to expand to the vicinity of positioned nutrient concentrations. In the natural
analogy of these terraces we might expect acidiphile roots to concentrate in
acidic patches of soil near sandstone, while those of calciphiles occupy more
alkaline soil in the vicinity of limestone. If correct, this model provides a
convenient lens with which to view complex microhabitats.
<p> The canopy
of the terraces consists mostly of young, small to mature Tuliptree, Sycamore,
Black Locust, apparently healthy Beech to 20 inches  (0.5 m)  dbh or more,
mostly overlooking the stream, rather small White Oak, White Pine, Canada
Hemlock, somewhat Adelgid infested, Bitternut Hickory (<i>Carya cordiformis</i>) , abundant Sugar and Black
Maples, some small Red Maple, Virginia Pine, White Ash, including the Biltmore
variety and scattered Black Walnut. An understory was formed by Muscletree (<i>Carpinus caroliniana</i>) , Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya virginiana</i>) , a few Cockspur Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus crus-galli</i>) , Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus florida</i>) and Alternate-leaf Dogwood (<i>C. alternifolia</i>) .
<p> Perhaps the
most abundant shrub was Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum</i> <i>acerifolium</i>) , but Black Haw Viburnum
(<i>V. prunifolium</i>) was also
common, as was Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) near the stream. Black Raspberry (<i>Rubus occidentalis</i>) was confined to rich soil
areas but much browsed by White-tailed Deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>) . The alien Autumn Olive (<i>Elaeagnus umbellata</i>) was scattered throughout.
<p> A low
alluvial bank in a somewhat open area just above the stream's southwest edge on
4-10-00 bore a rich flora consisting of beds of blooming Virginia Spring Beauty
(<i>Claytonia virginica</i>) , <i>Carex plantaginea</i>, Smooth Rockcress (<i>Arabis laevigata</i>) , also in bloom, Bloodroot (<i>Sanguinaria Canadensis</i>) in bloom as well, Wild
Stonecrop (<i>Sedum ternatum</i>) , <i>Carex communis</i>, Cutleaf Toothwort (<i>Dentaria laciniata</i>) gone to seed, Thimbleweed (<i>
Anemone virginiana</i>) , Virginia
Strawberry (<i>Fragaria virginiana</i>
), Smooth Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza 
longistylis</i>) , White Wood Aster (<i>Aster divaricatus</i>) , Bushy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum dichotomum</i>) and Hooked Crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus</i> <i>recurvatus</i>) . Nurturing these plants
was a dark, almost black low density soil, presumably as low in mineral matter
as it was high in organic matter. On handling this soil, fingers were stained
black as with a dye. A sample of this soil  (no 1) , taken from a depth of 2-3
inches  (5-8 cm)  gave an excellent pH reading of 7.4.
<p> On the low
terrace the trout lily <i>Erythronium 
umbilicatum</i>, then in seed, and one of two species in the region,
grew abundantly with Downy Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum pubescens</i>) , which was forming flower
buds. On the high terrace, under pine and Hemlock, there were abundant
Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>) ,
Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila 
maculata</i>) , Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>
) and the mosses <i>Thuidium 
delicatulum</i> on sandstone and a species of <i>Leucobryum</i> on soil.
A soil sample  (no 2)  taken from a depth of 2-3 inches in the vicinity of
these plants yielded another good pH determination of 4.7 and, although not as
dark as sample no 1, this sample was also quite rich in organic matter.
<p> Here we do
not report in detail on the flora of the steep shale bank of the stream's right
side. However Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia 
latifolia</i>) was conspicuous, as was a single plant of white flowered
Wild Pink (<i>Silene pensylvanica</i>) ,
while, just beneath, in the stream bed, grew Multiflora Rose (<i>Rosa multiflora</i>) and the stream sedge, <i>Carex
 torta.</i>
<p><i> </i>Signs
of fauna on this almost clear morning with light wind included the calls of
Ravens (<i>Corvus corax</i>) ,
possible unidentified warblers and, from a distance, Gray Tree Frogs (<i>Hyla versicolor/chrysoceles</i>) . Yellow
Swallowtail (<i>Papilio </i> sp)  and
Spring Azure (<i>Lycaenopsis 
argiolus pseudargiolus</i>) , as
well as a number of small orange colored butterflies were in evidence.
<p>During the afternoon a short
traverse was made upstream, keeping to the vicinity of the stream bed, which
was occupied by a shallow flow. Seen successively were the mosses <i>Hedwigia ciliata</i> on sandstone, <i>Anomodon
rostratus</i> on tree bases and <i>Platygyrium 
repens</i> on down wood. then <i>Carex 
platyphylla</i> in bloom, the moss <i>Anomodon attenuatus</i> on a stump and, on a rich, low bank in deep shade,
copiously blooming Early Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum dioicum</i>) . Following were the mosses <i>Bryoandersonia illecebra</i> and <i>Aulocomnium heterostichum </i>and blooming Wood Anemone
(<i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>) with
undivided leaflets.
<p>Continuing upstream, we saw, again
on a rich bank, Wild Blue Phlox (<i>Phlox divaricata</i>) , crayfish in a pool, overhanging Great
Rhododendron on a high southwest bank top with abundant luxuriant <i>Carex plantaginea</i> below; then a ten inch (
0.25 m)  White Ash, the thallus liverwort <i>Conocephalum conicum</i> on moist shale and an
unidentified species of the moss <i>Hygrohypnum</i> on rock in flowing water.
<p>We now arrived at an interesting
and diverse microhabitat on a small area of the northeast stream bank. On the
bank's upper surface, a little more than a meter above the stream, under a
small Hemlock, a 10 inch dbh Black Walnut and a smaller Slippery Elm, there was
a dense intergrowth consisting of Tree Moss (<i>Climacium americanum</i>) , Wild Stonecrop, Partridge
Berry and the remains of last season's Horse Balm (<i>Collinsonia</i> <i>canadensis</i>) . Immediately adjacent to
this intergrowth, on the northeast were large, luxuriant plants of <i>Carex plantaginea,</i> while, in close proximity
on the other side and also at the bank edge, a seedling of Black Maple  (as
determined on a later visit) , <i>Carex platyphylla</i>, Bulbiferous Bladder Fern (<i>Cystopteris bulbifera</i>) , Wild Ginger (<i>Asarum canadense</i>) and Hispid Greenbrier (<i>Smilax hispida</i>) . Below, at the base of the
meter high bank, that also bore Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>) , grew a few plants of
blooming Large-flowered Bellwort (<i>Uvularia 
grandiflora</i>) . Also part of the community were mosses, <i>Forsstroemia trichomitria </i>on Black Walnut and <i>Anomodon attenuatus</i> on the Hemlock.
<p>A Tufted Titmouse (<i>Parus bicolor</i>) as well as other unidentified
birds were heard nearby.
<p>A soil sample  (no 3)  was taken
from a depth of several inches immediately beneath the Tree Moss-vascular plant
intergrowth, This sample yielded an initial pH value of 5.0 and 24 hours later
one of 5.3.
<p>At this point, in the interest of
clarity, we introduce some data obtained on 5-14-00, namely pH determinations
for soil in close proximity to the Large-flowered Bellwort at the base of the
bank as referred to above. This sample  (no 12) , which consisted of an
original and a duplicate, was rich in organic matter, both as surface duff and
that well integrated with mineral matter. An initial value of pH= 6.4 was
obtained for both the original and duplicate, while after 24 hours these
yielded values of 7.0 and 6.9
respectively. This substantial variation of pH over the short distance between
the acidiphile and calciphile species is not unusual, and similar variations
over much shorter distances have been observed by this correspondent.
<p>Now, returning to our inventory of
4-10-00, we observed Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>) at several places at the
base of the steep southwest bank. In places here also, virtual monocultures of
the moss <i>Bryoandersonia illecebra </i>covered
large areas of this bank, while moist basal rocks bore the liverwort <i>Metzgeria furcata</i>. Following these we found
Alternate-leaf Dogwood, Apple Moss (<i>Bartramia pomiformis</i>) , Walking Fern (<i>Camptosorus rhyzophyllus</i>) and Maidenhair Spleenwort
(<i>Asplenium trichomanes</i>
), both on  (calcareous ?)  shale and <i>Carex 
plantaginea</i> below. Also on low ground, a cluster of Rattlesnake Plantain
grew on and around blocks and clasts of sandstone. A soil sample  (no 4) 
collected in close proximity to this plant yielded a pH value of 5.0 both
initially and 24 hours later – in further agreement between this parameter,
substrate and vegetation type.
<p>Again moving upstream we saw Ebony
Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium platyneuron</i>) 
and blooming Miterwort (<i>Mitella 
diphylla</i>) ;then more flamboyantly blooming Large-flowered Bellwort
in association with Broad-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago flexicaulis</i>) and an agrimony (<i>Agrimonia
</i> sp) ,, while the nearby sandstone
bore an unidentified species of the moss <i>Grimmia</i>. Here also, in a stream
hole, were minnows or small fish of another kind, while a millipede, apparently
drowned, and which resembled the common <i>Sigmoria aberans</i>, floated on the surface of the
same hole.
<p>This hole lay just below a massive,
vertically dipping bed of gray limestone several meters in thickness and which
created a small waterfall. Bryophytes on wet limestone here included
unidentified species of the mosses <i>Amblystegium</i> and <i>Hygrohypnum</i>
and the thallus liverwort <i>Conocephalum 
conicum</i>..
<p>Plants found on or near an adjacent
limestone cliff were Columbine (<i>Aquilegia canadensis</i>) in bloom, Virginia Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum</i>) , an unidentified jewelweed
(<i>Impatiens </i> sp) , Indian Turnip (
<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>) , Carolina
Crane's-bill (<i>Geranium carolinianum</i>
), Early Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga 
virginiensis</i>) , White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium rugosum</i>) , Allegheny Blackberry (<i>Rubus allegheniensis</i>) and the alien Petty
Spurge (<i>Euphorbia peplus</i>) .
<p>Of phenological interest is our
observation that while Cutleaf Toothwort had already gone to seed here, this
plant was still in full bloom in the Shenandoah Valley near Staunton at less
than 400 feet  (120 m)  higher in elevation.
<p>Our brief inventory of 5-14-00
began at 10:00 AM under brilliant skies and cool temperatures. Immediately
noted was the call of the Red-eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>) and the fading flowers of the Cockspur Thorn,
which were also more advanced than those of the same species in the Shenandoah
Valley near Staunton.
<p>Revisiting again the lowest terrace
with its mix of rock types, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain and Delicate Fern Moss (
<i>Thuidium delictulum</i>) were observed
to occupy a slight humus rich elevation five feet  (1.5 m)  from a two inch  (5
cm)  dbh sapling of Black Maple. Nearby several Beech saplings of similar size
stood beneath a ten inch  (0.25 m) dbh dead Virginia Pine. A sample  (no 11) 
of soil from a 2-3 inch depth less than a foot from one of these saplings had
an initial pH of 5.0 and the same value 24 hours later.
<p>Common on the approaches to the
acidic upper terrace were more saplings of Beech as well as those of Sugar and
Red Maples and Chestnut Oak (<i>Quercus 
prinus</i>) . However there were seedlings as well as larger trees of
Black Maple in all but the most acidic areas  (pervasive pH likely less than
5.0) . Also observed throughout were seedlings and small saplings of Northern
Red Oak, Biltmore Ash and Bitternut Hickory. Herbs found on this inventory
included Four-leaf Yam (<i>Dioscorea 
quaternata</i>) , Canada Moonseed (<i>Menispermum canadense</i>) , abundant Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata</i>) , Horse Balm and a little
Round-lobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica americana</i>) . A far less dense ground
flora and no calciphiles occurred in the most acidic areas populated by Red
Maple, Beech, Hemlock and pine. A dead Butternut (<i>Juglans cierea</i>) was observed on the lowest
terrace.
<p>A water sample taken from the
stream on this day had a pH of about
7.0, but this value was somewhat uncertain.
<p>Additional species noted upstream
from the terraces, in the vicinity of the limestone ledges reported on earlier,
included blooming Striped Violet (<i>Viola 
striata</i>) , the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, very large plants  (to 2 ft/0.6
m tall)  of Large-flowered Bellwort and abundant Horse Balm. However Red Maple
seedlings were common on the shale cut bank.
<p>Additional faunal signs were calls
of Scarlet Tanager (<i>Piranga 
olivacea</i>) heard throughout the inventory, as well as those of the
Yellow-billed Cuckoo (<i>Coccyzus</i> <i>americana
</i>). In the vicinity of the stream bed a large yellow Tiger Swallowtail (<i>Papilio
 glaucus</i>) was observed being
harassed by a small orange colored butterfly, likely a Pearl Crescent (<i>Phyciodes tharos</i>) .
<p>Our visit of 5-22-00 began at 10:00
AM under light rain, but skies soon cleared. Of interest was our observation
that, despite recent quite heavy rains, there appeared to be little if any more
water in the stream than on the previous visit.
<p>As before, our inventory began on
and in the vicinity of the small terraces at the northwest side of Crizer's
Gap. Species successively recorded there were Striped Violet in bloom, the
alien Tree of Heaven (<i>Ailanthus 
altissima</i>) , mostly as seedlings, Deertongue Grass (<i>Panicum clandestinum</i>) , seedlings of American
Basswood, Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia 
perfoliata</i>) with Partridge Berry under Virginia Pine on the low
terrace, Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina 
racemosa</i>) and seedlings of the calciphile Chinquapin Oak (<i>Quercus muehlenbergii</i>) in the area of mixed
rocks and floras. Of interest also was the occurrence of very robust plants of
Mountain Anemone (<i>Anemone 
lancifolia</i>) gone to seed. Accompanying these were Hairy Sweet
Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza claytoni</i>) 
near where its congener Smooth Sweet Cicely had been found earlier,
Thimbleweed, an indicator of rich soil, White Snakeroot, Daisy Fleabane (<i>Erigeron
annuus</i>) forming flower buds, likely Basil Balm (<i>Monarda clinopodia</i>) , Bittersweet (<i>Celastrus scandens</i>) , Virginia Snakeroot (<i>Aristolochia serpentaria</i>) , Common Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum biflorum</i>) quite near its congener <i>P. pubescens,</i> the tick-trefoil <i>Desmodium paniculatum</i>, Tall Goldenrod (<i>Solidago altissima</i>) , Wreath Goldenrod (<i>S. caesia</i>) , <i>Carex digitalis</i>, Cutleaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago arguta</i>) , Tall Agrimony (<i>Agrimonia gryposepala</i>) , <i>Carex blanda</i>, Clustered Snakeroot (<i>
Sanicula gregaria</i>) , the
alien Canada Bluegrass (<i>Poa 
compressa</i>) , Wingstem (<i>Verbesina alternifolia</i>) , the forest grass<i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea</i> <i>arborescens</i>) coming into bloom,
Enchanter's Nightshade (<i>Circaea 
quadrisulcata</i>) , Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>) , Boott's Goldenrod (<i>Solidago boottii</i>) , Winter Grape (<i>Vitis vulpina</i>),Wild Lettuce (<i>Lactuca Canadensis</i>) and Goat's Beard (<i>Aruncus
 dioicus</i>) .
<p>The alien Common Mugwort (<i>Artemisia vulgaris</i>) joined Multiflora Rose in the
stream bed, while the adjacent steep, acidic shale slope bore Entire-leaved
Yellow Foxglove (<i>Aureolaria 
laevigata</i>) , Mountain Bellwort (<i>Uvularia pudica</i>) and a <i>Leucobryum</i> moss,
likely <i>L. albidum</i>.
<p>Birds seen and/or heard here
included Red-eyed Vireo, Tufted Titmouse and Red-tailed Hawk (<i>Buteo jamaicensis</i>) .
<p>Now moving upstream to the vicinity
of the Tree Moss- vascular plant community described previously, we noted a few
plants of Golden Knees (<i>Chrysogonum virginianum</i>) in spectacular bloom, as well as Intermediate
Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>
), while on a nearby low microterrace there were the Split Gill fungus (<i>Schizophyllum commune</i>) , One-flowered Broomrape  (<i>Orobanche uniflora</i>) , Poke Milkweed (<i>Asclepias exaltata</i>) , seedlings of Cucumbertree, a
single <i>Collybia dryophylla </i>fungus,
the rich-soil tick-trefoil <i>Desmodium 
glutinosum </i>and Paw Paw (<i>Asimina triloba</i>) .
<p>The following bryophytes were

<p>&nbsp;
<p> During the
afternoon of 5-22-00 a loop traverse was made north of the road fork
immediately northwest of Crizer's Gap. The steep slope next to an old quarry
was ascended and the traverse continued up the ridge to its flat summit at a
little less than 1400 feet  (427 m) . The crest was then followed north for
perhaps ¼ mile  (0.4 km)  before descending again to the road. It is likely
that this traverse extended entirely over terrain underlain by Millboro Shale,
although no outcrops were seen to indicate this.
<p> Noted
successively on the steep initial slope were Virginia Pine, Bear Oak (<i>Quercus ilicifolia</i>) , small White Oak, Upland
Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>) 
laden with green fruit, Shining Sumac (<i>Rhus copallina</i>) , Deer Berry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i>) in flower, Poverty Oat
Grass (<i>Danthonia spicata</i>) ,
Variable Panic Grass (<i>Panicum 
commutatum</i>) , Cut-leaf Goldenrod, Southern Bellflower (<i>Campanula
 divaricata</i>) , Blue Wood
Aster  (Aster cordifolius)  and a
single seedling of Sycamore.
<p> Continuing
our climb, we saw Mountain Laurel in full bloom, Whorled Loosestrife (<i>
Lysimachia quadrifolia</i>) , also in
bloom, White Pine, Black Cherry, Red Maple, Southern Dewberry (<i>Rubus enslenii</i>) , Creeping Bush Clover (<i>Lespedeza repens</i>) , abundant young Scarlet oak, a
little Black Gum, Pitch Pine and cones of Table Mountain Pine (<i>Pinus pungens</i>) . A soil sample  (no 13)  that
was collected from a 2-3 inch depth, yielded a good pH value of 4.6.
<p> Still
climbing, we encountered the bluet<i>Houstonia nuttaliana</i>, numerous small serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier</i> sp)  close to the ground, the common mosses <i>Polytrichum</i>
 (likely <i>P. commune</i>) , <i>Dicranum scoparium</i> and a species of<i>Leucobryum</i>;
then a few stunted Beech saplings, the first Witch Hazel, also stunted, Spotted
Wintergreen, Saw Brier (<i>Smilax 
glauca</i>) , Squaw Root (<i>Conopholis americana</i>) , Sassafras, Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>) , Wild Indigo (<i>
Baptisia tinctoria</i>) , Chestnut Oak,
Wood Tickseed (<i>Coreopsis major</i>) ,
abundant Rattlesnake Weed (<i>Hieracium 
venosum</i>) in bloom, Hairy Angelica (<i>Angelica venenosa</i>) , <i>Carex pensylvanica,</i> Smooth Forked- chickweed (<i>
Paronychia canadensis</i>) and
Mountain Bellwort of very luxuriant aspect. Here also we saw a harvestman (
Phalangiidae) ; then a little Black Oak, healthy and vigorous-appearing
Flowering Dogwood and Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex/canadensis</i>) . We now
approached the ridge top, where we noted a 3-inch  (8 cm)  dbh sapling of
Beech.
<p> The ridge
top bore a young but nearly mature forest canopy with little undergrowth of
either shrubs or herbs but with a heavy leaf mat. The canopy was dominated by
Scarlet Oak, with associated White Oak, White Pine and scattered Hemlock.
Proceeding northwest, we soon encountered large patches of Black Huckleberry (<i>Gaylussacia baccata</i>) with Mountain Laurel, a little
Partridge Berry and Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigaea repens</i>) . A soil sample  (no 14)  was taken from a depth of
3-4 inches immediately under, but including some of the relatively thick mor
layer. This sample yielded an excellent pH value of 4.1.
<p> Black
Huckleberry here was represented by two forms. The most common of these by far
had an elongate, relatively narrow and shiny leaf, while the other form had a
larger, broader leaf with a dull surface. The canopy at this location was
dominated by Scarlet Oak with less common White Oak, White Pine, Black Gum, Red
Maple and scattered Hemlock. An Ovenbird  (
<i>Seiurus aurocapillus</i>) was
heard here.





<p> As we moved
farther along the ridge top we identified in one place a small colony of
Whorled Pogonia (<i>Isotria 
verticillata</i>) and, as we descended to the road, Common Many Knees.
<p> The
Virginia Natural Heritage Program established two 400 square meter test plots
in Crizer's Gap  (Fleming, 1999) . One of these plots, with a southwest aspect,
is located on the northeast side of the Gap at an elevation of 1500 feet  (458 m)  asl, and was classified
as &quot;dry mesic calcareous forest&quot;. The other plot, on the southwest
side of the Gap, has a northeast aspect, lies at about 1400 feet  (427 m)  asl
and is in &quot;rich cove/ mesic slope forest&quot;. Because these plots do not
include as many microhabitats as occur along the stream, a number of species
observed by us were not reported for them. Notably absent were Great
Rhododendron, Common Many Knees, Mealy Bellwort and Red Maple. However, either
specific to the slope habitats or missed by us, were the ferns Purple
Cliffbrake (<i>Pellaea atropurpurea</i>) and Hairy Lipfern (<i>Cheilanthes lanosa</i>) , as well as Cliff Stonecrop (<i>Sedum glaucophyllum</i>) – all on the dry mesic
calcareous slope. We also failed to find a number of species such as Bladdernut
(<i>Staphylea trifolia</i>) , Hairy
Heuchera (<i>Heuchera villosa</i>) 
and Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum 
thalictroides</i>) found by Fleming in the rich cove/ mesic slope
forest.
<p> These slope
plots on limestone may be compared with the greatly different flora found by us
on the acid terrain developed from shale bedrock.

<h2>Base of Ridge</h2>

<b>Source walks: 4-23-00 and 5-7-00</b>
<ul>
<p> The
following inventories were conducted along the northwest base of Nimrod Hall
Ridge about 1/3 mile  (0.54 km)  southwest of Crizer's Gap. The terrain is
essentially talus slope punctuated by large rock-fall blocks at an elevation of
near 1200 feet  (366 m)  asl. Limestone talus and calcareous soils dominate,
but chert and sandstone are also present. Much of the sandstone appears to be
calcareous  (silica grains cemented by carbonate), and thin beds of this rock
frequently form projections on large blocks of limestone. While the weathered
surfaces of these projections do not effervesce to acid, their freshly broken
surfaces do., a characteristic also of similar rocks found at Blowing Springs (see <a href=blows.htm>our section on Blowing Springs</a>). Thus, as pointed out in our discussion of
that area, acidiphile species may in principle be closely juxtaposed to
calciphiles under some conditions where such rocks occur.
<p> Perhaps as
a consequence of abundant moisture in the Ridge base talus and northerly aspect, the forest here is highly
mesic and the flora largely calciphile. No markedly acidiphile species such as
Red Maple and Beech or herbs with strictly acid affinities were observed, and
in this way the flora differs markedly from that found on the alluvium of
Crizer's Gap. The canopy appears to be dominated by Sugar Maple. But Black
Maple is also common. Scattered throughout are large – some very large –
Basswood, White Ash, Black Walnut and Tuliptree. Less common are Slippery Elm,
Black Locust, Sycamore, Cucumbertree and White Oak. Also seen were a few
saplings of Chinquapin Oak, including one at 5 inches  (0.13 m)  dbh, a single
mature Hackberry (<i>Celtis 
occidentalis</i>) , a few saplings of the same and one Adelgid-infested
Hemlock. There are also some Northern Red Oak where the slope steepens and
Ash-leaf Maple (<i>Acer negundo</i>) 
in moist areas.
<p> Bladdernut,
the dominant shrub, and very abundant as seedlings, was accompanied by Paw Paw,
Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>) ,
Wahoo (<i>Euonymus atropurpurea</i>
), Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus 
Canadensis</i>) , Coral Berry and, on convexities, by Buffalonut (<i>Pyrularia pubera</i>) .
<p> Our
traverse of 4-23-00 began on the adjacent Cowpasture River flood plain where we
tallied Tuliptree, Sycamore, Sugar Maple, Coral Berry, Spice Bush, May Apple (<i>Podophyllum peltatum</i>) , Broad-leaved Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum canadense</i>) and Virginia Bluebells (<i>Mertensia virginica</i>) in full bloom, as well as
such aliens as Multiflora Rose. Calls of the Great Crested Flycatcher (<i>Myiarchus crinitus</i>) were heard.
<p> As we
entered the slope forest we encountered an exceedingly luxuriant vernal herb
flora. On a more elevated part of the gently sloping Ridge base Twinleaf (<i>Jeffersonia diphylla</i>) , which dominated the ground
cover in a dense blanket, had already gone to seed. Also prominent was
Large-flowered Trillium (<i>Trillium 
grandiflorum</i>) with flowers a little past prime. Other species
successively noted were abundant large plants of Blue Cohosh, Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>) with spectacularly
variegated blooms, Smooth Sweet Cicely,
Cleavers (<i>Galium aperine</i>) ,
Yellow Corydalis (<i>Corydalis flavula</i>
), also gone to seed; then Virginia Spring Beauty, Broad-leaved Waterleaf,
Large-flowered Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum 
macrophyllum</i>) and Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>) – with all four in bloom.
These were followed by Kidney-leaf Crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus abortivus</i>) , Hairy Bittercress (<i>Cardamine hirsuta</i>) , Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinqefolia</i>) and the calciphile
Bulbiferous Bladder Fern on limestone talus.
<p> Next seen
were an unidentified Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens </i> sp) , Marginal Shield Fern, May Apple, a grape vine (<i>Vitus </i> sp) , Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>), Wood Nettle, Rattlesnake Fern (<i>
Botrychium virginianum</i>) , Downy
Many Knees, Bloodroot, Hooked Crowfoot, Christmas Fern, a flock of Goldfinch (<i>Spinus tristis</i>) , a Cardinal (<i>Cardinalis cardinalis</i>) and a Common Yellowthroat (
<i>Geothlypis trichas</i>) . Also noted
were the ¾ inch  (2 cm)  shells of a land snail; then blooming Wild Stonecrop,
Round-lobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica 
americana</i>) , Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria pubera</i>) , also in bloom, common Cutleaf
Toothwort gone to seed, Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>) , Tree Moss on a rock, Wild
Ginger (<i>Asarum canadense</i>) ,
Walking Fern and blooming Columbine, both on a large block of limestone; then Canada Moonseed , Japanese
Honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera japonica</i>) , Basil Balm, Squirrel Corn (<i>Dicentra canadensis</i>) , Wild Blue Phlox in full
bloom, <i>Carex communis,</i> Downy
Yellow Violet (<i>Viola</i> <i>pubescens</i>
), also in bloom, Wild Geranium (<i>Geranium 
maculatum</i>) , in bloom as well, White Avens (<i>Geum canadense</i>) and the alien Wild Garlic (<i>Allium vineale</i>) .
<p> Traversing
toward the southwest, we came upon a lower area with a springbrook that clearly
drained the talus slope and which, as we shall see, was quite alkaline. As this
low area was approached, Broad-leaved Waterleaf replaced Twinleaf as the
dominant herb. Also abundant here was Spice Bush. Other conspicuous herbs were the alien Garlic Mustard (<i>
Alliaria officianalis</i>) , blooming
Northern Swamp Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus septentrionalis</i>) , the alien Ground Ivy (<i>Glechoma hederacea</i>) , False Mermaid Weed (<i>Floerkea proserpinacoides</i>) , the alien <i>Lysimachia nummularia</i>, Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>) , Tall Coneflower (<i>
Rudbeckia laciniata</i>) and<i>
Phacelia fimbriata</i> .
<p> Mosses
identified by R. Hunsucker from the higher part of the area with large
limestone blocks are as follows:

<p><i>Anomodon 
attenuatus</i> – on rocks, bases of trees.
<br>Brachythecium 
oxycladon – on rocks, bases of trees, down boles. 
<br>Bryhnia graminicolor
– on rocks.
<br><i>Dicranum fulvum</i>
– on sandstone.
<br><i>Grimmia apocarpa</i>
– on rocks. 
<br><i>Hedwigia ciliata</i>
– on sandstone.
<br><i>Hypnum pallescens</i>
– on rocks.
<br><i>Mnium cuspidatum</i>
– on rocks, soil, down boles.
<br><i>Platygyrium 
repens</i> – on rocks, tree trunks, down boles.
<p>&nbsp;
<p> Soils here
appear for the most part to be of low density, dark and rich in organic matter,
but, while dominantly calcareous, were derived from a variety of rock types. On
this day a sample  (no 8)  was taken from a depth of 2-3 inches on a local
convexity close to Twinleaf and Round-lobe Hepatica. This sample had an initial
pH of 5.6, but a few hours as well as 24 hours later this had fallen to 4.9.
This sample contained large fragments of sandstone, and it is possible that in
the closed system represented by the isolated sample, it was over time buffered
by the sand.
<p> Our brief
visit of 5-7-00 began at 10:oo AM under clearing skies and unseasonably warm
temperatures. Immediately noticed were the calls of Wood Thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustelina</i>) , Scarlet Tanager and
Red-eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>) ,
as well as unidentified species, including warblers, in the dense shrubs of the
flood plain adjacent to the slope forest.
<p> Confirmed
in a traverse in the slope forest were the presence of Hairy sweet Cicely, Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>) , Hispid Greenbrier, a few
plants of Ginseng (<i>Panax 
quinqefolius</i>) , Striped Violet in bloom, Smooth Yellow Violet (<i>Viola</i> <i>pensylvanica</i>) , also in bloom, scattered 
Multiflora Rose, <i>Carex 
hirtifolia,</i> the calciphile <i>Carex 
albursina</i>, Enchanter's Nightshade, a number of large grape vines (<i>
Vitis </i> sp)  up to 3 inches  (8 cm) 
in diameter and Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus 
radicans</i>) .
<p> Several
soil samples were taken and their pH values determined. Although these
determinations exhibit large uncertainties, they clearly indicate slight
acidity to slight alkalinity. The first of these samples  (no 9)  was a very
dark, low density soil from a depth of 2-3 inches at the base of a Black Maple
sapling. Initial pH values fell in the range of 6.2 – 7.2 and after 24 hours,
in the range 6.2 – 8.2. The second sample  (no 10)  was taken from a depth of
2-3 inches close to Round-lobe Hepatica, in coarse humus, on a low convexity.
Initial values of pH for this sample fell in the range of 6 – 7 and those 24
hours later, in the range of 6.3 – 7.6.The uncertainty in these pH values may
be related to complex organic reactions or to reaction of the moistening water
with coarser calcareous mineral matter over time.
<p> A water
sample was also taken from the aforementioned springbrook that emerges from the
talus slope. An excellent value of pH=8.1 was obtained for this water.
<p> Many bird
calls were heard throughout the inventory, particularly in the morning and
early afternoon. These included calls of Wood Thrush, Scarlet Tanager, Red-eyed
Vireo, yellow-billed Cuckoo and Pileated Woodpecker (<i>Dryocopus pileatus</i>) . Also heard were likely calls
of the Gray Tree Frog, as well as those of unidentified birds. However, no
Ovenbird, a common forest interior species, was heard, perhaps as a consequence
of unfavorable habitat presented by the dense ground flora.
</ul>
<h2>River Slopes, Terraces and Flood Plains</h2>
<b>Source Walks: 4-23-00 and 5-22-00</b>
<ul>
<p> Included in
our inventories are the edge of a high terrace, low terraces, flood plains and
a mountain slope adjacent to a low terrace of the Cowpasture River.
<p> Our first
inventory, on the morning of 4-23-00, under cool, cloudy and somewhat windy
conditions, began at the edge of the north-facing high terrace, perhaps 80 feet
 (24 m) above the River. The forest here is acid-xeric in character, with a
canopy dominated by mature but rather small Chestnut Oak, Shagbark and Pignut (
<i>Carya glabra</i>) Hickories, Black
Cherry of poor form and Red Maple. Downy Seviceberry was particularly abundant
as mature trees and as saplings and seedlings, A few saplings of White Pine
were also present. Shrub layers were dominated by Witch Hazel, with lesser
amounts of Maple-leaf Viburnum, a little Mountain Laurel, Upland Low Blueberry,
seedling-sized Great Rhododendron and St. Andrew's Cross (<i>Hypericum hypericoides</i>) . Common Greenbrier was
very abundant at the forest edge.
<p> Herbs on
the upper terrace edge were dominated by the trout lily <i>Erythronium umbilicatum </i>. Both Common and Downy
Many Knees were present, the former with narrow and the latter with broader
leaves, and seemingly occupying slightly different microhabitats. Other herbs
included Great Chickweed, scattered patches of stunted Partridge Berry, the
wood rush <i>Luzula echinata,</i>
Poverty Oat Grass, Hairy Hawkweed  (<i>Hieracium gronovii</i>) , seedlings of Whorled
Loosestrife, a little Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium</i> <i>virginianum</i>) , clumps of Red Fescue (<i>Festuca rubra</i>) and Ovate-leaved Violet (<i>Viola
 fimbriatula</i>) .
<p> The terrace
edge was rich in bryophytes  (see the listing that follows as well) . In some
places there were patches of the moss <i>Hypnum</i>,
but most conspicuous were species of Haircap Moss (<i>Polytrichum </i> sp) , including <i>P. commune</i>, cushions of <i>Leucobryum </i>(
likely<i>L. glaucum</i>) , <i>Aulocomnium heterostichum</i>, a species of <i>Dicranella</i>,
<i>Platygyrium</i> <i>repens</i> on the
bases of Chestnut Oak, a species of <i>Atrichum</i>,<i>Dicranum scoparium</i>, <i>Tetraphis pellucida</i> and Wheat Moss (<i>Diphyscium foliosum</i>) . At least one species of <i>Cladina</i>
lichen was also common, as were macrolichens in general on Chestnut Oak.
<p> A soil
sample  (no 5)  taken from immediately beneath <i>Polytrichum</i> yielded an
initial pH value of 4.5 and the same value 24 hours later, both readings being
of excellent quality.
<p> Although
few birds were recorded here, an unidentified loud caller was heard from an
adjacent brushy area.
<p> In the
following list of bryophytes from the terrace edge, as determined by R.
Hunsucker under the microscope, liverworts are specifically indicated, while
mosses constitute the rest.
<p>&nbsp;
<br><i>Atrichum 
angustatum</i> – on soil.
<br><i>Bryoandersonia 
illecebra</i> – on soil.
<br><i>Ceratodon 
purpureus</i> – on soil.
<br><i>Chiloscyphus 
profundus</i>  (syn <i>Lophocolea 
heterophylla</i>) – a liverwort on soil and bases. of trees.
<br><i>Dicranella </i> sp
 (sterile)  – on soil.
<br><i>Ditrichum 
pallidum</i> – on soil between road and wood's edge.
<br><i>Hypnum 
curvifolium</i> – on soil and humus.
<br><i>Isopterygium 
distichaceum </i>– on soil.
<br><i>Leucobryum 
glaucum </i>– on soil and humus.
<br><i>Mnium affine</i> var <i>ciliare</i>
– on soil.
<br><i>Pleuridium 
subulatum </i>– on soil between road and wood's edge.
<br><i>Platygyrium 
repens</i> – on tree trunks.
<br><i>Pohlia nutans</i>
– on soil.
<br><i>Polytrichum 
ohioense</i> – on soil.
<br><i>Scapania nemorosa
</i>– a liverwort on ?
<br><i>Thuidium 
delicatulum</i> – on soil, humus.
<br><i>Weissia 
controversa</i> – on soil.
<p>&nbsp;
<p> On
descending the north-facing slope beneath the community described above. Sugar
Maple assumed prominence. Accompanying it were White Ash, Great Chickweed,
White Wood Aster, Spring Bluets (<i>Houstonia caerulea</i>) in bloom, Virginia Spring
Beauty, also in bloom, Plume Lily, Downy Many Knees and the mosses <i>Bryoandersonia
 illecebra</i>, a species of <i>Polytrichum</i>,
a <i>Mnium</i>, <i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>
and a <i>Leucobryum.</i>
<p>A soil sample  (no 6) , dark reddish brown in color and
apparently rich in organic matter, was taken from a depth of 2-3 inches on
midslope here. This sample had the surprisingly low pH value of 4.5 both
initially and 24 hours later.
<p> At the
bottom of the slope, on a narrow terrace or first bottom, immediately above the
River bank, the above mentioned mosses increased in abundance and were associated with mats of Partridge
Berry, a little Spotted Wintergreen, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, Creeping
five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex /
canadensis</i>) and Red Fescue. Hophornbeam also occurred here.
<p> Moving west
on the terrace and parallel to the stream bank, we encountered a dramatic
change in the flora and a great increase in undergrowth. This undergrowth
included Paw Paw, Black Locust, Muscletree, Coral Berry, Poison Ivy, White Wood
Aster, Cutleaf Toothwort in seed, Black Cohosh, Meadow Garlic (<i>Allium canadense</i>) , the trout lily <i>Erythronium americanum </i> (as distinguished from <i>E. umbilicatum</i> found on the terrace above
), Common Many Knees and Wild Stonecrop. The undergrowth was accompanied by
very little moss but an unidentified species of <i>Atrichum</i>. Just above, on
the lower slope, stood a large Sugar Maple, its base heavily covered by a
species of <i>Anomodon</i> moss and Wild Stonecrop. In summary, this community
appeared to bespeak a rich soil. In appearance a sample of this soil  (no 7) 
taken here at a depth of 2-3 inches, was similar to the previous sample.
However, given the observed flora, it came as a surprise that it also had a pH
of 4.5 both initially and 24 hours later. It may be that this sample was not
representative of soil dominating the root zone , although this flora is not
necessarily excluded at this pH.
<p> Again
moving west, the narrow terrace gave way to a broader section of flood plain
populated in part by an open canopy of Sycamore, Black Walnut Ash-leaf Maple
and &quot;Sugar Maple&quot;, which , with its emerged leaves on our next visit,
proved to be Black Maple. Here Spice Bush was the dominant shrub and Japanese
Honeysuckle (<i> Lonicera japonica</i>) a prominent vine.
Conspicuous herbs noted in our rapid passage were Riparian Wild Rye (<i>Elymus
 riparius</i>) , Downy Yellow
Violet, Bulbous Cress  (<i>Cardamine bulbosa</i>) and Virginia Bluebells in full
bloom.
<p> We now
arrived at a foot bridge crossing of the Cowpasture River, the opposite side of
which ended in a small clump of profusely blooming Paw Paw on the low terrace
or second bottom. A little beyond the bridge lay a steep southeast facing slope
of Beards Mountain, According to Rader and Evans  (1993)  this slope as well as
most surrounding area is underlain by Braillier Formation rocks. In agreement
with their description of this formation, rocks on this slope consisted of
dark, greenish, fine grained material – siltstone and shale – that split into
thin plates but showed little fissility 
and weathered brown. Farther upslope, perhaps 75 feet  (23 m)  above the
terrace, a meter thick, more massive bed, also dark in color, stood out.
Although, as we shall see, this slope is occupied by a rich calciphile flora,
acid applied to several of its rocks, including both the platy and more massive
beds, resulted in no effervescence .
<p> The slope
is occupied by an impressive mature and rich mesic forest consisting of
Northern Red Oak, Sugar and Black Maples, White Ash, Black Walnut, Basswood
and, at the slope's foot, Ash-leaf Maple. Few shrubs were noted, but Bladdernut
and Coral Berry were common at the slope's foot.
<p> The entire
lower slope, to a height of perhaps 100 feet  (30 m)  was covered by a
luxuriant blanket of unusually large plants of Twinleaf liberally sprinkled with Garlic Mustard.
Although practically hidden, many other species were present as well. On
4-23-00 these included Canada Moonseed, May Apple, Large-leaved and Virginia
Waterleaf, both in bloom, the fern Blunt-lobed Woodsia (<i>Woodsia obtusa</i>), Tall Bellflower (<i>Campanula americana</i>) , Wild Ginger, Large-flowered
Trillium, also in bloom, Yellow Corydalis, Dutchman's Breeches (<i>Dicentra cucullaria</i>) , a grape vine (<i>Vitis</i> sp) , Indian Turnip, blooming Striped
Violet, Virginia Knotweed (<i>Polygonum virginianum</i>) , the calciphile
sedge <i>Carex jamesii</i>, Kidney-leaf
Crowfoot, Hairy Bittercress, Downy Wood Violet, Bloodroot, White Snakeroot, the
mosses <i>Weissia controversa</i> and <i>Hedwigia
 ciliata </i>on rocks, Great
Chickweed, Deertongue Grass, <i>Carex 
blanda</i>, American Pennyroyal (<i>Hedeoma pulegioides</i>) , Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Stickweed (<i>Hackelia
 virginiana</i>) , <i>Carex communis</i>, Millet Grass (<i>Milium effusum</i>) , the alien Great Mullein <i>(Verbascum thaspus</i>) and the fungi <i>Pluteus cervinus</i> and <i>Polyporus squamosus</i>, with the last named on a
decaying down bole lying at the foot of the slope. The only bird identified on
the slope was an Eastern Phoebe (<i>Sayornis 
phoebe</i>) .

<p> Our return
to the area during the late afternoon of 5-22-00 was under almost clear skies,
a slight breeze and pleasant temperatures. As we approached the foot bridge we
noted Black Maple for the first time on the flood plain and heard calls of
Black-billed Cuckoo (<i>Coccyzus 
erythropthalmus</i>) and Red-eyed Vireo.
<p> On crossing
the foot bridge and ascending the mountain slope along a trail, we added the
following to our tally of plants: Common Many Knees, Japanese Honeysuckle,
Wingstem, Venus Looking Glass (<i>Specularia 
perfoliata</i>) , Climbing False Buckwheat (<i>Polygonum scandens</i>) , Smooth Forked- chickweed and
Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>
). In a curious turn a small unidentified bird was flushed from a nest built in
the Black Cohosh.
<p> A soil
sample  (no 15)  was collected from a depth of 2-3 inches immediately down
slope from a few plants of Twinleaf. This soil, which appeared rich in organic
matter, proved once more to be more acidic than expected so near this
calciphile. It had an initial pH of 5.3 and six hours later this had dropped to
4.7. It is possible that the site had been subject to acid leaching, or that
calciphiles here draw upon alkaline colluvial solutions. The drop in pH with
time may have again resulted from internal buffering by siliceous rock
fragments in the sample, once it was isolated from the pervasive solutions.
<p> We now
descended again to the terrace, which lay perhaps 3 meters above the current
level of the River. A semicircular traverse was then made to the River and
along its bank to the foot bridge. Species and terrain features are presented
here in the order in which they were observed. Recorded first was the sedge <i>Carex oligocarpa</i>, a species of &quot;moist
rich woods&quot;, according to Strausbaugh and Core  (1978)  and abundant Coral
Berry. We then took a sample  (no 16)  from a depth of 2-3 inches in the rich
appearing terrace soil. We were again surprised at the relatively low pH of
this sample, which had an initial value of 4.7 and after six hours one of 5.0.
<p> Continuing
our traverse, we saw in succession <i>Carex 
amphibola</i>, Paw Paw, very abundant and vigorous Coral Berry, abundant
Nodding Fescue, Ash-leaf Maple dominantly of sapling size and the most abundant
woody plant; then Sweet-scented Bedstraw, black Cherry very crooked in form,
abundant Black Walnut, <i>Carex tenera</i>,
<i>C</i>, <i>squarrosa</i>, Spice Bush,
Stiff Marsh Bedstraw (<i>Galium 
obtusum</i>) , Canada Moonseed, the alien <i>Lysimachia nummularia</i>, Kidney-leaf Crowfoot, Downy
Wood Violet, Green Dragon (<i>Arisaema 
dracontium</i>) , False Nettle (<i>Boehmeria cylindrica</i>) , the alien Wild Garlic and Virginia Wild Rye (<i>Elymus virginicus</i>) . We here reached the edge of the first bottom
near the River. On this bottom herbs greatly dominated the vegetation, but
widely spaced young Black Walnut were also common. Most conspicuous, if not
most abundant among the herbs, were Wingstem, Garlic Mustard and especially a
variety of grasses and sedges. Among these Virginia Wild Rye was prominent, but
also notable were the aliens Rough Bluegrass (<i>Poa trivialis</i>) and Hairy Chess 
(<i>Bromus commutatus</i>) .
These grasses were accompanied by a number of attractive sedges such as <i>Carex sparganioides</i> var <i> sparganioides</i>, <i>C</i>. <i>shortiana </i>and <i>C. stipata</i>, with
the last two at the River's edge.
<p> A notable
part of the fauna here was a small damselfly, perhaps 1.25 inches  (3.2 cm)  in length, apparently of the Narrow
Winged family  (Coenagrionidae)  with translucent amber head and thorax and
clear wings. This insect was extraordinarily abundant, perching everywhere on
tall herbs near the water. 
<p> Having
reached the River, we followed its bank toward the foot bridge, on the way
noting a patch of floating Cow Lily (<i>Nuphar advena</i>) , a cutgrass (<i>Leersia </i> sp) , <i>Juncus effuses</i> in the swollen River, an abundance of Virginia Wild
Rye, a brome grass, Small Yellow Crown Beard (<i>Verbesina occidentalis</i>) ; then Black Elderberry
and Water Pepper (<i>Polygonum 
hydropiper</i>) ,followed by more vigorous Green Dragon, Virginia
Knotweed, Panicled Aster (<i>Aster 
simplex</i>) , Asiatic Water Pepper (<i> Polygonum</i> <i>cespitosum
</i>), the alien Sweet Vernal Grass (<i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i>) , Deer tongue Grass, a Jewelweed  (<i>Impatiens</i> sp)  and the alien Orchard Grass (<i>Dactylis glomerata</i>) . Here we ascended again to
the higher terrace on which we saw the blue-eyed grass <i>Sisyrinchium angustifolium</i> and Golden Ragwort (<i>
Senecio aureus</i>) . A determination of the pH of
Cowpasture River Water on 4-23-00 yielded a value of 6.0.
<p> Nimrod Hall Ridge and Vicinity, because of its geologic,
topographic and floral diversity, presents unusual opportunities for the study
of floristics and forest ecology . The State Natural Heritage Program has made
a good start in this direction, particularly in its comparisons of the area
with a variety of forest types throughout the State  (Fleming <i>et al</i>,
2001)  However, the Natural Heritage emphasis is different than the approach
espoused here. It is directed toward the detailed classification of floral
types, with utilization of set test plots in which the floras are regarded as
units. By contrast, the approach here is on microhabitats and the precise
locations of species in relation to specific rock and soil types and
topography, with the objective of the determination of the stability of species
and communities  (Mueller,2000) . In any case, the manifold ecological,
scientific and aesthetic assets of the area warrant a high priority of
protection and restoration of its natural character. Additionally, its
generally rich soils assure it an important role in the regional ecologic mosaic
as a source of nutrients for fauna, which are not readily available in adjacent
areas such as the Rough Mountain Wilderness, where acidic, siliceous rocks dominate.
