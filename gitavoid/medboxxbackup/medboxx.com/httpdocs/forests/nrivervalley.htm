<p><h1>North River Valley </h1>
<h2>Augusta County, Virginia</h2>
<b>August, 2002</b>

<blockquote>





 <p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<ul>
 <p> Here we report
 on our walks along a segment of the upper North River, a branch of
 the South Fork of the Shenandoah River. This segment of the River
 flows southeast in a deep valley on the southeast slope of
 Shenandoah Mountain and lies within our proposed Ernie Dickerman
 Wilderness. This valley is quite constricted in its upper reaches,
 but broadens greatly at the proposed Wilderness boundary at Forest
 Road 96. Elevations within the area of our inventories vary from
 2100 feet (640 m) to 2480 feet (746 m) asl over a distance of
 about 4 miles (6 km) The elevation and configuration of this
 valley, particularly its broad opening toward the southeast, have
 important implications for the nature of the flora.<p>
  Our work is based
 on thirteen inventory traverses, as well as observations around our
 camp that were conducted from 8-24-01 to 5-24-02.<p>
 
<p>
</ul>
<h2>Source Walks : 8-24-01, 9-12-01 and 9-13-01</h2>
<ul>
 <p> Our
 first inventory, in the vicinity of Camp Todd, began at 10:00 AM on
 8- 24- 01. The flora here, which was briefly described in our
 section on the <a href=hardscrabble.htm>ascent of Hardscrabble Knob</a>, included a mature canopy
 of Sugar Maple (<i>Acer saccharum</i>),  Tuliptree (<i>Liriodendron
 tulipifera</i>), White Pine (<i>Pinus strobus</i>), Adelgid -
 infested Canada Hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>), American
 Basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>), Black Locust (<i>Robinia 
 pseudoacacia</i>), White Ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>), 
 Northern Red and White Oaks (<i>Quercus rubra</i> and <i>Q. alba
 </i>), Red Maple (<i>Acer rubrum</i>), Black Birch (<i>Betula 
 lenta</i>) and a very little Yellow Birch (<i>Betula 
 alleghaniensis</i>). <p>
  A soil temperature
 determination (T-229) was made on the flat at the usual depth of
 5 inches (13 cm) under mature White Pine and Sugar Maple. A
 temperature of 19.0 deg C was obtained. A soil sample (no 1) was
 also collected here at the conventional depth of 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) in a silt/sand loam with considerable organic matter. A pH
 value of 4.7 was obtained for this sample.<p>
  Flora in the
 immediate vicinity of this sample consisted of Coral Berry (<i>Symphoricarpos orbiculatus </i>), abundant seedlings of White
 Ash and Sugar Maple, Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>), seedlings of White Pine, blooming White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium
 rugosum</i>), Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>), abundant White Grass (<i>Leersia virginica</i>), Deer-tongue
 Grass (<i>Panicum </i> <i>clandestinum</i>), American Basswood.
 Black Locust saplings, Woodland Strawberry, (<i>Fragaria vesca</i>), a seedling of the pignut hickory <i>Carya glabra,</i> the
 creeping five-leaf <i>Potentilla canadensis</i>, an unidentified
 violet (<i>Viola </i> sp), Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium 
 delicatulum</i>), Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata</i>), an
 unidentified <i>Atrichum</i> moss, seedlings and saplings of Striped
 Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>) and the sedge <i>Carex 
 gracilescens</i>.<p>
  In an adjacent
 area were Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>), the forest
 grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, Sassafras (<i>Sassafras 
 albidum</i>), Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</i>), mature White Ash, vigorous Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea</i> 
 <i>canadensis</i>), Northern Red Oak, Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis 
 virginiana</i>) and Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus radicans</i>). A few
 mosquitoes (Culicidae) and numerous biting &quot;punkies&quot; (Ceratopogonidae) were in evidence here.<p>
  Next recorded were
 Black Raspberry (<i>Rubus occidentalis</i>), which was common in
 openings, Tall Agrimony (<i>Agrimonia gryposepala</i>), a few Red
 Maple, blooming White Wood Aster (<i>Aster divaricatus</i>) and
 Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum </i> c<i>anadense</i>) with
 Partridge Berry.<p>
  A brief survey,
 including soil temperature and pH, was now done at the base of
 Springhouse Ridge, on the Valley's west side, and where the trail
 ascends the Ridge. The soil temperature (T-230) was found to be
 18.5 deg C at the usual depth of 5 inches, while the pH (soil
 sample no 2) at 2-3 inches depth was 4.6.<p>
  The plant
 community here included Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium filix-femina</i>), Bloodroot (<i>Sanguinaria canadensis</i>), Hairy Sweet Cicely
 (<i>Osmorhiza claytoni</i>), Dutchman's Pipe Vine (<i>Aristolochia
 macrophylla</i>), Hog Peanut, Adelgid-infested Hemlock and,
 nearby, a single, partly dead Yellow Birch. 
 <p>A
 brief survey was also done in another part of the flood plain a few
 hundred feet to the northeast of the first area inventoried. Found
 here were Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>), 
 abundant Partridge Berry, the broad-leaved forest sedge <i>Carex 
 platyphylla</i>, Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i>), a
 mature White Oak, a little Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>), abundant seedlings of Red Maple, Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago 
 curtisii) </i> and Downy Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum pubescens</i>). <p> 
 The inventory was
 now terminated as a result of a thunderstorm.<p>
 Our next inventory
 was conducted on the flood plain during the morning of 9-12- 01
 and beginning about 1/4 mile (0.4 km) southeast of Camp Todd. From
 there a traverse was made up-valley toward Camp Todd, covering
 both sides of the road. The inventory began in a grove of mature
 trees that included Sugar Maple, White Pine, White Ash, American
 Basswood, Northern Red and White Oaks, Shagbark Hickory (Carya 
 ovata), Black Gum (<i>Nyssa sylvatica</i>), Hemlock, Tuliptree
 and Red Maple. The understory consisted of Striped Maple and a
 little Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus florida</i>) and shrubs noted
 were Witch Hazel, a little Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>) 
 and in an opening, Black Raspberry. Vines included Virginia Creeper,
 a little Poison Ivy and Dutchman's Pipe Vine. Carolina Wrens (<i>Tryothorus ludovicianus</i>) and Pileated Woodpeckers (<i>Dryocopus pileatus</i>) were also observed.<p>

 We now crossed to
 the west side of the road, where, also, we initiated our collection
 of bryophytes for later identification under the microscope by R.
 Hunsucker. In what follows liverworts are distinguished by the
 symbol (Li), while the mosses constitute the rest.<p>
 Bryophyte sample #1
 was collected from the bark of several Black Birch, Sugar Maple and
 a 20 inch (0.5 m) White Oak. The following species were
 identified:<p>
 <ul>
 <p><i>Amblysregium
 varium, Anomodon attenuatus, Anomodon rostratus, Campylium 
 chrysophylum, Fissidens osmundioides, Frullania brittoniae </i>(Li),<i>
 Leucodon brachpus var brachypus, Platygyrium repens,
 Schwetschkeopsis fabronia, Ulota crispa</i><p>
 </ul>
 <p> After
 recording a 17 inch (0.43 m) dbh Yellow Birch, bryophyte sample #2
 was collected from sandstone in the vicinity. Found were the
 Following:<p>

 Pine, Only the following were recorded:<p>
 <ul>
 <p><i>Brotherella 
 recurvans, Frullania brittoniae</i> (Li),<i>Homomallium adnatum,

 <p><i>Anomodon 
 attenuatus, Atrichum angustatum, Bryoandersonia illecebra,
 Ctenidium molluscum, Fissidens bushii, Hypnum curvifolium, Mnium 
 cuspidatum, Platygyrium repens, Rhynchostegium serrulatum,
 Thuidium delicatulum</i><p>
 </ul>
 
 <p> Also noted
 here was Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola blanda</i>). <p>
  A soil temperature
 determination (T-242) was now made and a soil sample (no 3) 
 taken. The temperature obtained at the usual depth of 5 inches was
 T= 17.5 deg C, whereas the soil sample had an initial pH of 4.5 and
 24 hours later 4.7.<p>
  Bryophyte sample
 #7 was then taken from the bark of Black Oak (Quercus velutina), 
 with the following result:<p>
 <ul>
 <p><i>Anomodon 
 attenuatus, Brachythecium oxycladon, Campylium chrysophyllum,
 Ctenidium molluscum, Fissidens osmundioides, Frullania brittoniae
 </i>(Li),<i>Homomallium adnatum, Plagiothecium cavifolium, 
 Platygyrium repens, Porella platyphylla</i> (Li)<p>
 </ul>
 <p> This was
 shortly followed by sample #8 from the base of a Hemlock. Found
 were:<p>
 <ul>
 <p><i>Amblystegium
 serpens, Amblystegium varium, Anomodon attenuatus, Brachythecium 
 rutabulum, Bryum capillare, Campylium chrysophyllum, Cololejeunea 
 biddlecomiae </i>(Li),<i>Fissidens osmundioides, Frullania

 Leskea gracilescens, Metzgeria furcata </i>(Li),<i>Platygyrium 
 repens, Porella platyphylla </i>(Li),<i>Tortella humilis </i>
 </ul>
 <p> This is an
 exceptionally diverse assemblage for any habitat associated with
 Hemlock.<p>
  Our next bryophyte
 sample (#9) was obtained from the soil surface beneath Sugar Maple
 and a large Northern Red Oak. Included were the following:<p>
 <ul>
 <p><i>Brachythecium
 oxycladon, Campylium chrysophyllum, Eurhynchium hians, Fissidens 
 adianthoides, Fissidens osmundioides, Mnium affine var ciliare, </i>
 </ul>
 <p> Here we
 encountered a Chestnut Oak (<i>Quercus prinus</i>), and one of
 the few examples of this species encountered on low areas of this
 flood plain. In association was a quite healthy-appearing
 Flowering Dogwood.<p>
  Continuing our
 advance up-valley, we returned to the section east of the road and
 entered an area of old temporary stream channels. Here, on an east -
 facing bank, under Sugar Maple and Hemlock, we encountered the only
 Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) seen by us in
 the entire Shenandoah Mountain region. It was a mature bush. Other
 species in the vicinity were a mature Yellow Birch, Dotted St. Johns
-wort (<i>Hypericum punctatum</i>), the &quot;fire weed&quot;<i>
 Erechtites hieracifolia </i>and the sedge <i>Carex virecens</i>.<p>
  A little farther
 up-valley on a west-facing bank rich in sandstone flags and
 under a Northern Red Oak we found a single stunted plant of
 Columbine (<i>Aquilegia </i> <i>canadensis</i>). A soil sample (no 4) was collected as near to this plant as possible. An initial
 value of pH obtained for this sample was 5.4, while 24 hours it was
 5.5, or essentially the same. The sample dried rapidly, indicating a
 low content of organic matter and a high content of silt.<p>
  A bryophyte sample
 (# 10) was also collected from rocks in the vicinity, with the
 following result:<p>
 <ul>
<i>Brachythecium
 rutabulum, Bryoandersonia illecebra, Campylium chrysophyllum,
 Entodon compressus, Homomallium adnatum, Mnium cuspidatum,
 Plagiothecium cavifolium, Thuidium delicatulum</i><p>
 </ul>
 <p> Also noted in
 the general vicinity were abundant <i>Carex platyphylla</i>, Common
 Speedwell (<i>Veronica officinalis</i>), Northern Dewberry (<i>Rubus flagellaris</i>), Poison Ivy, a large buttressed
 Cucumbertree (<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>) and the sedge <i>Carex 
 digitalis</i>.<p>
  The next bryophyte
 sample (# 11) was taken from the base of the large Cucumbertree,
 which had a dbh of 28 inches  (0.71 m).  Species noted were the
 following:<p>
 <ul>
 <p><i>Anomodon 
 attenuatus, Entodon compressus, Fissidens adianthoides, Leskea 
 gracilescens, Rhodobryum roseum</i><p>
 </ul>
 <p> A nearby large
 down Sugar Maple base yielded bryophyte sample # 12 and the
 species:<p>
 <ul>
 <p><i>Amblystegium
 varium, Entodon cladorrhizans, Mnium cuspidatum, Platygyrium 
 repens, Thuidium delicatulum</i><p>
 </ul>
 <p> Our final
 bryophyte sample of the series (# 13) was taken from a broken -
 over and re-sprouted 9 inch (0. 23 m) Red Maple and a large
 Northern Red Oak in a semi-opening. The following species were
 tallied:<p>
 <ul>
 <p><i>Amblystegium
 serpens, Brotherella recurvans, Eurhynchium hians, Haplohymenium 
 triste, Leucodon brachypus var brachypus, Mnium cuspidatum,
 Plagiothecium cavifolium, Platygyrium repens, Ulota hutchinsiae</i><p>
 </ul>
 <p> Canada
 Mayflower occurred under Hemlock, and a family of Blue Jays (<i>Cyanocitta cristata</i>) was active here.<p>
 
 <p> The following
 are bryophyte frequencies for the foregoing 13 habitats.<p>

 <p> In the
 vicinity of Camp Todd again, we arrived at the right bank of the
 River at the site of a substantial hole that contained numerous
 small fish, as well as some 6 inches (15 cm) or more in length A
 spot inventory of the vegetation on a gravel bar adjacent to the
 hole revealed the following: Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea 
 arborescens</i>), Wrinkled-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa
 </i>), Cut-leaf Goldenrod (<i>S. arguta </i>var <i>arguta</i>), 
 Blue Wood Aster, Calico Aster, Boneset (<i>Eupatorium perfoliatum</i>), Common Evening Primrose (<i>Oenothera biennis</i>), Woodland
 Muhly, Crooked-stem Aster (<i>Aster prenanthoides</i>), Leafy
 Beggar-tick (<i>Bidens frondosa</i>), Deer-tongue Grass, Fowl
 Manna Grass (<i>Glyceria striata</i>), Twisted Sedge (<i>Carex 
 torta</i>).  Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus</i>), 
 Spotted Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens capensis</i>) in bloom, Arrow -
 leaf Tearthumb (Polygonum sagittatum), Clearweed (<i>Pilea 
 pumila</i>), Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>), Purple -
 stem Willowherb (<i>Epilobium coloratum</i>), Wood Nettle, Horse
 Balm (<i>Collinsonia canadensis</i>) and the aliens Coltsfoot (<i>Tussilago farfara</i>) and Meadow Fescue (<i>Festuca elatior
 </i>).<p>
  Birds recorded in
 the vicinity were American Crow (<i>Corvus brachyrhynchos</i>), 
 White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>Sitta carolinensis</i>) and a
 drumming Ruffed Grouse (<i>Bonassa umbellus</i>).<p>
  We now moved
 southeast down-valley to a point approximately 0.6 mile (1 km) 
 northwest of the first bridge. The elevation here is approximately
 2150 feet (656 m) asl, and the environment is one of old fields
 reverting to forest and patches of forest.<p>
  Here we entered a
 shady but open forest with a canopy consisting largely of Hemlock,
 White Pine and White Oak. We then initiated a new series of
 bryophyte samples, but under our same numbering system. The first
 sample, #14, was collected from charred wood and bore the following
 species:<p>
 <ul>
 <p><i>Amblystgium 
 varium, Mnium punctatum var punctatum, Platygyrium repens</i><p>
 </ul>
 <p> Bryophyte
 sample # 15 was then collected from the soil surface, and the
 following obtained:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Amblystegium
 serpens, brachythecium rutabulum, Dicranella sp, Mnium 
 cuspidatum</i>, <i>Pohlia </i> sp, Pottiaceae (unid. sterile) <p>
  </ul>
 <p> It was noted
 that while ground cover was sparse, Partridge Berry, <i>Carex </i>
 <i>platyphylla</i> and Christmas Fern were quite common.<p>
  Bryophyte sample #
 16 was now taken from stumps and roots of White Pine. It contained
 the Following:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Brachythecium
 rutabulum, Dicranella heteromalla, Hypnum curvifolium, Hypnum 
 pallescens, Isopterygium elegans, Mnium hornum, Platygyrium 
 repens</i>
 </ul>
 <p> As we
 progressed up-valley, the following species of vascular plants
 were tallied. Common Greenbrier, Black Birch, Sugar Maple,
 Interrupted Fern, <i>Brachyelytrum </i> <i>erectum</i>, White Wood
 Aster, Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea </i>), Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>). Slender-flowered Muhly, Wild
 Liquorice (<i>Galium circaezans</i>), Saw Brier, a single shrub
 of Upland Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>), Variable
 Panic Grass (<i>Panicum commutatum</i>), Intermediate Shield Fern
 (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>), Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia 
 perfoliata</i>), a small patch of the liverwort <i>Bazzania</i>
 <i>trilobata</i>, Black Gum, an unidentified violet (<i>Viola </i>
 sp), Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema </i> <i>triphyllum</i>), New York
 Fern, Red Maple, a little Coral Berry and Round-leaf Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia</i>) under Hemlock. Here also, a Red -
 shouldered Hawk (Buteo <i>lineatus</i>) was heard calling.<p>
  Although
 conditions were too dry for the appearance of many fungi, the
 following were collected and identified by R. Hunsucker:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Suillus
 americanus</i>-edible; associated with White Pine (Phillips, 1991). <br>
 <i>Suillus 
 granulatus</i>-edible; also associated with White Pine.<br>
 <i>Austroboletus 
 gracilis</i>-associated with and Hemlock.<br>
 <i>Lactarius 
 piperatus</i>-common in deciduous woods. 
  </ul>
 <p> We now moved
 farther down-valley to a location about 0.1 mile (0.16 km) 
 northwest of the first bridge and set up camp. The elevation here is
 near 2120 feet (647 m) asl. The evening was cool and pleasant, but
 no night birds were heard.<p>
  The morning of 9 -
 13-01 dawned bright and quiet with a heavy dew, after a rather
 balmy night. Ravens (<i>Corvus corax</i>) called impressively and
 a variety of woodpeckers pecked and drummed loudly. Crows were also
 heard.<p>
  The forest here is
 quite open and old fields are more conspicuous than at our last
 inventory site, Trees are of uneven age, with scattered large
 spreading, open-grown examples, especially of White Oak among
 younger growth.<p>
  Among the most
 common trees were White Pine, White Oak and Red Maple. The ground
 flora around camp included Nimblewill (<i>Muhlenbergia schreberi
 </i>), large patches of Tree Moss (<i>Climacium americanum</i>) 
 in association with Partridge Berry, the alien Indian Strawberry (<i>Duchsnea indica</i>) and the creeping five-leaf <i>Potentilla
 </i> <i>canadensis</i>. The deciduous spinulose shield fern
 <i>Dropteris carthusiana</i> was also common here. Other species
 noted were Christmas Fern, Common Speedwell, Cutleaf Grapefern (<i>Botrychium dissectum</i>), abundant White Snakeroot, lush
 patches of Hog Peanut, the alien grass <i>Microstegium vimineum</i>,
 blackberry much browsed by White-tailed Deer (<i>Odocoileus 
 virginianus</i>), Poison Ivy, the alien Multiflora Rose (<i>Rosa 
 multiflora</i>), Saw Brier, Northern Dewberry, Sweet-scented
 Bedstraw,, White Grass and the Trail rush (<i>Juncus</i> <i>tenuis
 </i>). Also conspicuous was the abundance of macrolichens on the 
 light-exposed trees of the open forest (see our pending survey of
 lichens here).  
 <p> To the east of
 camp we encountered Muscletree (<i>Carpinus caroliniana</i>), 
 Pennsylvania Pelitory (<i>Parietaria pensylvanica</i>) and, in
 the open, a large patch of Coral Berry.<p>
  A soil temperature
 determination (T-243) was made and a soil sample (no 5) taken
 in the midst of the Coral Berry patch. The soil temperature was
 found to be 17,0 deg C, and the soil sample had pH values of 4.7 
 and 4.5 initially and 24 hours later respectively. This soil
 appeared to be rich in both clay and organic matter, since it formed
 hard lumps on drying and drying required a long time.<p>
  Additional species
 seen in the open in the vicinity were the alien bittersweet
 <i>Celastrus orbiculatus</i>, Horse Nettle (<i>Solanum 
 carolinense</i>), Poke (<i>Phytolacca </i> <i>americana</i>), 
 Common Ragweed (<i>Ambrosia artemisifolia</i>), Autumn Bent Grass, Cudweed (<i>Gnaphalium obtusifolium</i>) in bloom, the alien
 Self-heal, very common Ebony Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium 
 platyneuron</i>), the alien Field Sorrel (<i>Rumex acetosella</i>), Poverty Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia spicata</i>), Curtis Goldenrod
 and Hairy Bedstraw (<i>Galium pilosum</i>).  
 <p> Here also, we
 found Wild Turkey (<i>Meleagris gallopavo</i>) dust baths and
 spotted a Wood Nymph (<i>Gercyonis pegala </i>var <i>pegala</i>) 
 Butterfly. 
 <p> Continuing
 east across the opening, we recorded Woodland Muhly, the alien
 Velvet Grass (<i>Holcus lanatus</i>), very tall Indian Hemp (<i>Apocynum cannabinum</i>), Field Basil (<i>Satureja vulgaris</i>) 
 and American Germander (<i>Teucrium canadense</i> var <i>canadense
 </i>) in bloom.<p>
  We presently
 arrived at a small linear wetland that extended down-valley and,
 at least in part, had its source in a small pond about 10 meters in
 diameter. From the large trees on its bank and lack of any sign of
 excavated material, the pond appeared to be natural and likely
 marked a sinkhole. Water from this pond had a temperature (T-244) of 16.0 deg C and a pH of 6.8, a value consistent with limestone
 influence in this generally acidic terrain.<p>
  Most of the
 wetland is in the open and consists of a springbrook that flows down
-valley and, within a few hundred feet is absorbed in a meadow,
 Wetland hebaceous species were dominated by the alien grass
 <i>Microstegium vimineum</i>, but there were many native herbs as
 well. A soil sample (no 6) that consisted of a black organic mud,
 had an initial pH of 6.1, but 24 hours later this had increased to
 6.8. This sample appeared to be rich in clay as well as organic
 matter.<p>
  Other herbs
 identified in the wetland were Larger Water Starwort (<i>Callitriche
 </i> <i>heterophylla</i>), Marsh Purslane (<i>Ludwigia palustris</i>
) *, Rice Cutgrass  (<i>Leersia oryzoides</i>) *, <i>Carex 
 frankii</i>*, Water Smartweed (<i>Polygonum punctatum</i>) *,
 Arrow-leaf Tearthumb, Clearweed*, <i>Carex lurida</i>*, Fowl
 Manna Grass*, <i>Scirpus polyphyllus</i>, Pennsylvania Bittercress
 (<i>Cardamine pensylvanica</i>), Clayton's Bedstraw (G<i>alium 
 tinctorium</i>), <i>Carex vulpinoidea</i>*, Small-flowered St.
 John's Wort (<i>Hypericum</i> <i>mutilum</i>), Field Mint (<i>Mentha arvensis</i> var <i>canadensis</i>) *, Northern
 Bugleweed*, Water Speedwell (<i>Veronica anagallis-aquatica</i>) *, Great Blue Lobelia (<i>Lobelia </i> <i>siphilitica</i>) *,
 Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio aureus</i>) *, Hooked Crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus recurvatus</i>), Purple-leaved Willow Herb*, Honewort (<i>Cryptotaenia canadensis</i>) *, Common Monkey Flower
 (M<i>imulus ringens</i>) *, the &quot;fireweed&quot; <i>Erechtites
 hieracifolia</i>, the tickseed B<i>idens connata</i>*, and Mad -
 dog Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria lateriflora</i>) *.<p>
  In the above
 listing an asterisk indicates the species also occurs in the Folly
 Mills Calcareous Wetland (Hunsucker and Mueller, 1998). <p>
  On the bank
 adjacent to the springbrook we observed Black Haw Viburnum (<i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>), Intermediate Shield Fern, Downy Wood
 Violet and the acidiphile sedge <i>Crex intumescens.</i><p>
 <i> </i>A Catbird (<i>Dumetella carolinensis</i>) called nearby.<p>
  Bryophyte sample #
 17 was now collected from soil over rock in the wetland. Observed
 were the following:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Amblystegium
 serpens, Amblystegium varium, Brachythecium rutabulum, Bryum</i> 
 <i>capillare, Hedwigia ciliata</i> (on dry patch) <p>
  </ul>
 <p> Sample # 18
 from wet rocks at the wetland edge was collected next, but yielded
 only the species<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Amblystegium
 varium, Brachythecium rutabulum </i>
 </ul>
 <p> The following
 (sample # 19) were then tallied from a wet down bole in the pond:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Amblystegium
 serpens, Hypnum curvifolium, Mnium cuspidatum, Philonotus 
 muhlenbergii, Platygyrium repens</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p> The genra
 <i>Amblystegium, Brachythecium </i>and <i>Philonotus </i>are
 frequent in wet habitats (Crum and Anderson, 1981). <p>
  Again, in the
 immediate vicinity of our camp, we were impressed by the general
 abundance in the forest of <i>Dryopteris carthusiana</i>, Ebony
 Spleenwort and Partridge Berry, while in the open we recorded the
 aliens Knotweed (<i>Polygonum aviculare</i>) and Smooth Crabgrass
 (<i>Digitaria ischaemum</i>). <p>
  Butterflies were
 common in the open and included Great Spangled Fritillary (<i>Speyeria
 cybele</i>), Red-spotted Purple (<i>Limenitis arthemis 
 astyanax</i>), Silver-spotted Skipper (<i>Epargyreus clarus</i>) and Pearl Crescent (<i>Phyclodes tharos</i>). <p>
  In what follows we
 report on the results of a traverse to the south of camp by R.
 Hunsucker. Species identified by him were Cucumbertree, Sassafras,
 Deerberry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i>), the &quot;fireweed&quot;
 <i>Erchtites hieracifolia</i>, Wild Carrot (<i>Daucus </i> <i>carota
 </i>), Broomsedge (<i>Andropogon virginicus</i>), American
 Pennyroyal (<i>Hedeoma pulegioides</i>), Japanese Honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera japonica</i>), Upland Low Blueberry, Wild Geranium,
 White Vervain (<i>Verbena urticifolia</i>), Bushy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum</i> <i>dichotomum</i>), the alien &quot;bittersweet&quot;
 <i>Solanum dulcamara, </i>Common Milkweed (<i>Asclepias syriaca</i>), Allegheny Blackberry (<i>Rubus allegheniensis</i>), Hemlock,
 May Apple (<i>Podophyllum peltatum</i>), the pignut <i>Carya 
 glabra, Carex laxiflora,</i> Winterberry Holly (<i>Ilex 
 verticillata</i>), Enchanter's Nightshade (<i>Circaea 
 quadrisulcata</i>), Common Beggar Tick (<i>Bidens vulgata</i>), 
 Creeping Phlox (<i>Phlox stolonifera</i>), Common Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum biflorum</i>), Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>) and the rare orchid <i>Corallorhiza 
 maculata</i>.<p>
  On this traverse
 bryophyte sample # 20 was collected from rotting down boles of White
 Pine, and which resulted in the following species:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Bazzania 
 trilobata, Hypnum curvifolium, Leucobryum glaucum, Nowellia 
 curvifolia</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p> Also collected
 on the same traverse from soil was sample # 21, which contained:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Atrichum 
 angustatum, Dicranum scoparium, Hypnum curvifolium, Leucobryum 
 glaucum, Pleurozium schreberi, Polytrichum ohioense, Thuiddium 
 delicatulum</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p> Fungi
 collected from soil on the same traverse were<p>
 <ul>
 <p><i>Amanita virosa</i><br>
 <i>Amanita fulva</i><br>
 <i>Collybia butyracea</i>-common on fallen pine needles<br>
 <i>Collybia dryophylla</i><br>
 <i>Chrysomphalina chrysophylla</i>-on rotting White Pine<br>
 </ul>

 <p> On this day a
 late afternoon foray was made to the west of the road in the
 vicinity of camp. As we advanced west to the stream bank we
 successively noted Anthracnose-killed Flowering Dogwood,
 Bottlebrush Grass (<i>Elymus hystrix</i>), a small patch of Cliff
 Stonecrop (<i>Sedum glaucophyllum</i>), large White Pine, Slender
-flowered Muhly, Summer Grape (<i>Vitis aestivalis</i>), 
 abundant Christmas Fern, Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria </i> <i>pubera</i>), Tuliptree, a patch of Wingstem (<i>Verbesina alternifolia</i>) 
 in an opening, Grass-leaved Goldenrod (<i>Euthamia graminifolia
 </i>) not yet in bloom, Sycamore (<i>Platinus </i> <i>occidentalis</i>), the grass <i>Panicum latifolium</i>, abundant Partridge Berry,
 Witch Hazel, Hairy Sweet Cicely and Woodland Muhly. We here reached
 the steep bank of the North River where Cardinal Flower (<i>Lobelia
 cardinalis</i>) was in bloom. As we made our return to camp, we
 noted Cut-leaf Grapefern, Oyster Mushroom (<i>Pleurotus 
 ostreatus</i>) and the fungus <i>Spongipellis unicolor </i>on
 dead, down Northern Red Oak.<p>
  In the late
 afternoon in camp, dragonflies were actively foraging for gnats and
 other small insects, even taking up positions on the heads of
 humans, and from there making sorties about the face. Long-horned
 wood borers flew about as did sulfur butterflies. Later identified
 by R. Hunsucker were the Southern Pine Sawyer (<i>Monochamus 
 titillator</i>) and the Locust Borer (<i>Megacyllene robiniae</i>), with the latter being found on goldenrod.<p>
  Of interest on
 this part of the flood plain, as distinguished from that farther up
-stream, was the apparent absence of markedly boreal species such
 Yellow Birch and Canada Mayflower, except for the single find of
 <i>Corallorhiza maculata </i> (However, see a later inventory for an exception!). This feature is likely a consequence of the open
 character of the Valley, which allows cold subsiding air to be
 rapidly dissipated.<p>

 <h2>Source walks: 9-26-01, 9-27-01 and 9-28-01</h2>
 <ul>
  For these
 inventories our base camp was again located at the site 0.1 mile
 northwest of the first bridge. Four inventory traverses were made
 from here. The first of these on the morning of 9-26-01 extended
 south from camp on the east side of the road. On the morning of 9-27-01 a traverse was made up-valley from camp, again to the east
 of the road. This traverse terminated about 0.5 mile northwest of
 the camp where we had conducted an inventory on 9-13-01. In the
 afternoon a second inventory was initiated at the point at which
 the road intersects the base of the mountain slope a about a half
 mile above the previous inventory. This traverse extended roughly
 west across the flood plain, crossed one channel of the stream and
 terminated at the second channel to the west. A return by a slightly
 different route intersected a springbrook in the upland between the
 two channels. On 9-28-01 a short traverse was made to the west
 of the road and immediately south of the first bridge.<p>
  The 9-26-01
 traverse began at near 10:00 AM under cool, windy and partly cloudy
 conditions. Blue Jays and a Red-shouldered Hawk were heard.<p>
  A soil temperature
 determination (T-265) was now made at the same site as was T -
 243 on 9-13-01. The value obtained, T= 14.0 deg C, was three
 degrees cooler than on that date.<p>
  A soil sample (no
 7) was then taken from an open meadow, perhaps 100 feet (30 m) 
 south of the termination of the circum-neutral Springbrook. just
 east of camp. This soil appeared to be a silt loam, rich in organic
 matter. It had an initial pH value of 4.9, and 24 hours later one of
 4.7. It appears that any bases contributed to this meadow by
 absorption of the springbrook were overwhelmed by the prevalent acid
 terrain subject to further acid leaching.<p>
  Now, moving south,
 several small Virginia Juniper (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>) 
 punctuate the increasingly wooded meadow. There were lush clumps of
 shrubs and herbs that included the tallest Coral Berry (~ 1.5 m) 
 and thorny blackberries (~ 3 m) ever seen by this reporter.
 Associated were Common Speedwell, an unidentified violet, abundant
 Horse Nettle, Field Thistle (<i>Cirrsium discolor</i>) and Deer -
 tongue Grass. A pH determination (no 8) of the soil here yielded
 an initial value of 5.1, but 24 hours later this had decreased to
 4.8.<p>
  After first adding
 Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>) to our tally, we
 entered the forest in which the <i>Corallorhiza maculata </i>had
 been found. The canopy was dominated by large, if young, White Pine
 and perhaps older White Oak, some of which, by their spreading
 crowns, had clearly matured in a more open environment. Partridge
 Berry appeared to be particularly abundant, and patches of Tree Moss
 and Hog Peanut were common. Fungi noted were <i>Phellinius robimiae</i>
 on Black Locust, <i>Cantharellus </i> <i>cinnabarinus</i> and
 <i>Clitocybe clavipes</i>. In places the moss <i>Pleurozium 
 schreberi</i> formed large mats. Here also, we saw the first White
 Ash, Hay-scented Fern, a few seedlings of Black Cohosh and stunted
 Horse Balm.<p>
  We soon reached a
 springbrook that discharged into the North River at a small angle
 and which had been dammed by Beaver (<i>Castor canadensis</i>). 
 Here, on a large White Oak stump grew the fungi <i>Daedaleopsis 
 ambigua </i>and <i>Polyporus squamosus</i>, while the adjacent soil
 bore <i>Chroogomphus vinicolor </i> (Miller, 1979).  also present
 on the bank were a large Sugar Maple and the native bittersweet
 <i>Celastrus scandens. </i>In the springbrook itself we found the
 sedges <i>Scirpus pollyphyllus </i>and <i>Carex scabrata.</i> 
 <p> A soil sample
 (no 9) was taken from the bed of the springbrook under flowing
 water. It had an initial pH of 5.0, but after 24 hours this had
 decreased to 4.7. A water sample of the springbrook had a pH of 4.9.<p>
  As we moved south
 along the west side of the springbrook, we noted in succession the
 fungus <i>Pluteus cervinus </i> (the &quot;Deer Mushroom&quot;), a
 small Spice Bush, Woodland Muhly, Slender-flowered Muhly, Upright
 Yellow Wood Sorrel, an unidentified mountain mint (P<i>ycnanthemum </i>
 sp), Indian Turnip, a little Wild Hydrangea, Wild Sage (<i>Salvia 
 lyrata), </i>the panic grass <i>Panicum boscii</i>, seedlings of
 Downy Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier arborea</i>), the alien Crown
 Vetch (<i>Coronilla varia</i>), Pennsylvania Bittercress,
 Sensitive Fern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>), Black Oak, 
 American Water-pennywort (<i>Hydrocotyle americana</i>), a
 little Columbine, Panicled Hawkweed (<i>Hieracium paniculatum</i>), 
 Round-leaf Violet, Wild Liquorice (<i>Galium circaezans</i>), 
 White Lettuce (<i>Prenanthes altissima</i>) and the fungus
 <i>Lycoperdon perlatum </i> (edible puffball). <p>
  As we reached the
 upper end of the Beaver pond we noted that it contained a dense
 growth of an unidentified burreed (<i>Sparganium </i> sp) and an
 alga of the genus <i>Spyrogyra</i>. Nearby an Eastern Phoebe (<i>Syornis phoebe</i>) exhibited its diagnostic tail-bobbing.<p>
  We now returned up
-stream to our point of origin, but on a route closer to the road.
 We then saw our first Ground Berry (<i>Rubus hispidus</i>), 
 followed by Purple-stem Aster (<i>Aster puniceus</i>) ; then in
 the forest near the first bridge, <i>Carex gracilescens</i> and
 Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>). <p>
  This day, also,
 around camp, we noted the abundance of Muscletree, the heavy cover
 of bryophytes on some down boles, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, Round
-leaved Pyrola (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia</i>), Intermediate Shield
 Fern, the alien Motherwort (<i>Leonurus cardiaca</i>) and
 Goosefoot (<i>Chenopodium berlandieri</i> var <i>bushianum</i>). <p>
  At about 10:00 AM
 of 9-27-01 a traverse was begun up-valley from camp and east
 of the road. Successively noted near the beginning of our traverse
 were large White Pine with an understory of Red Maple saplings, a
 single small plant of the acidiphile tick-trefoil <i>Desmodium 
 nudiflorum</i>, and the one of only two members of the genus seen
 in the region. A spot inventory then disclosed an unidentified
 basswood (<i>Tilia </i> sp), the pignut hickory <i>Carya glabra,</i>
 Northern Red oak, White Ash, White Oak, Black Gum, large, sturdy
 Striped Maple and Round-leaved Pyrola. Continuing, we saw
 Flowering Dogwood, abundant Partridge Berry, a single shrub of
 Mountain Fetterbush, (<i>Pieris </i> <i>floribunda</i>), and the
 only example of the genus seen. These were followed by common
 occurrence of patches of the moss <i>Pleurozium schreberi, </i>Spiked
 Lobelia, Upland Low Blueberry, Deer Berry and Wild Sage. Then, at
 the edge of an old clearcut dominated by saplings, we observed a
 Cardinal (<i>Cardinalis cardinalis</i>) and, among a tangle of
 slash, a large Poke plant.<p>
  We now entered a
 section of dark forest dominated by young Hemlock and White Pine,
 with a few scattered Pitch Pine (<i>Pinus rigida</i>).  Also
 present here was the fungus <i>Gerronema chrysophylla</i>, a
 species characteristic of conifer down wood. Enlivening our
 experience were several Hairy Woodpeckers (<i>Picoides villosus</i>) 
 and White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>Sitta carolinensis</i>).  Other
 faunal signs were heaps of cone scales at the bases of White Pine,
 indicating feeding by, in all probability, squirrels.<p>
  Advancing up -
 valley again, we saw European Self-heal (<i>Prunella vulgaris</i>
 var <i>vulgaris</i>), a little Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila
 maculata</i>) and cushions of the moss <i>Leucobryum</i>. We then
 entered a dense stand of White Pine saplings, beneath which grew
 Intermediate Shield Fern and Partridge Berry. Continuing, we noted
 Blue Jays, a Tufted Titmouse (<i>Parus bicolor</i>), Black Birch,
 White-breasted Nuthatch and Common Greenbrier heavily browsed by
 Deer. These were followed by Northern Bugleweed, more patches of
 <i>Pleurozium schreberi</i> with Indian Strawberry, unidentified
 species of <i>Russula</i> and <i>Lactarius</i> fungi, Woodland Muhly
 and patches of Tree Moss.<p>
  A soil sample (no
 10) was taken from as shallow a depth as possible immeditely
 beneath the Tree Moss. It had an initial pH of 4.7, but 24 hours
 later this had decreased to 4.4.<p>
  Next observed on
 our traverse were a considerable number of ten inch (0.25 m) dbh
 Hemlock, a little Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Christmas Fern, Black
 Birch, the grass <i>Panicum boscii </i>and Hog Peanut.<p>
  We now reached the
 road at about 0.7 mile (1.1 km) above the first bridge. We crossed
 the road and proceeded up an old woods road that was barred by a
 &quot;Kelley Hump&quot;. We noted that the soil here was a deep
 sandy loam, with few rocks and probably had been the site of a
 precious crop field during the settler period. We followed the
 blocked woods road into a very shady forest with a canopy dominated
 by mature but not old Hemlock and White Pine, and with little
 shrubby or herbaceous vegetation. A 28 inch (0.71 m) dbh White
 Pine was among the larger trees.-<p>
  We soon reached a
 channel of the North River in the vicinity of which we recorded Red
 and Sugar Maples, scattered Virgin's Bower (<i>Clematis virginiana</i>), Indian Pipe and Partridge Berry. The liverwort <i>Nowellia 
 curvifolia </i>was present on down boles and an unidentified species
 of <i>Frullania </i>on Hemlock. Isolated shrubs of the alien
 Japanese Barberry (<i>Berberis thunbergii</i>) were also
 observed.<p>
  A bryophyte sample
 (# 22) was here taken from the bark of White Pine and Hemlock,
 with the following result:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Brotherella 
 recurvans, Frullania asagrayana </i>(Li), <i>Frullania brittoniae</i>
 (Li),<i>Hypnum </i> <i>curvifolium</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p> After noting
 the presence of White Ash saplings, bryophyte sample # 23 was
 collected from the bark of a pignut hickory at the forest edge. The
 following species were observed:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Anomodon 
 attenuatus, Campylium chrysophyllum, Cololejeunea biddlecomiae
 </i>(Li),<i>Frullania brittoniae </i>(Li),<i>Leucodon julaceus,
 Neckera pennata, Rhynchostegium serrulatum</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p> The common
 occurrence of an unidentified species of <i>Atrichum</i> moss on
 soil in the vicinity was also noted.<p>
  Other species
 subsequently observed in the general area were Pileated Woodpecker,
 Spotted Wintergreen, Rattlesnake Fern, Blunt-lobe Hepatica, Poison
 Ivy on White Pine, Ox-eye (<i>Heliopsis helianthoides</i>), 
 American Dog Violet (<i>Viola </i>c<i>onspersa</i>), Common
 Milkweed (<i>Asclepias syriaca</i>) and the fungi <i>Phaeolus 
 schweinitzii</i> (parasitic on White Pine) and an unidentified
 species of <i>Coprinus</i>. Our traverse was then terminated.<p>
  At about 1:00 PM
 on 9-27-01 we began a traverse at about a mile north of camp,
 where the road intersects the base of the mountain slope We at first
 traversed a short distance up-valley at a small angle with the
 mountain side and through a forest with large, but likely not old
 White Pine and smaller Hemlock and Tuliptree. Like many others in
 this valley, this forest had very sparse shrub and ground floras.<p>
  After assuming a
 more westerly course, bryophyte sample # 24 was taken from the bark
 of Tuliptree, with
 the following result:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Anomodon
 attenuatus Campylium chrysophyllum, Ctenidium molluscum,
 Frullania asagrayana </i>(Li),
 <i>Frullania brittoniae </i>(Li),<i>Mnium affine, Platygyrium 
 repens, Pylaisiella selwynii, Thuidium delicatulum</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p> Advancing
 up-valley we noted Black Oak, Christmas Fern and seedlings of
 White Ash. Our next bryophyte sample (# 25) was collected from the
 bark of Sugar Maple. It contained the following:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Anomodon
 attenuatus, Campylium chrysophyllum, Frullania brittoniae (</i>Li),
 <i>Haplohymenium triste, Leucodon julaceus, Metzgeria furcata
 </i>(Li),<i>Mnium affine,.Plaagiothecium cavifolium, Platygyrium 
 repens, Porella platyphylla </i>(Li)<p>
  </ul>
 <p> Next
 observed were Blunt-lobe Hepatica, an unidentified orchid of the
 genus <i>Habenaria, </i>Cancerroot (<i>Conopholis americana</i>), 
 Common Greenbrier, Partridge Berry, White Oak, Black Birch,
 Cucumbertree, Downy Yellow Violet (<i>Viola pubescens</i>), <i>Carex
 platyphylla </i>less than normally glaucus, Rattlesnake Fern,
 Variable Panic Grass, a single shrub of Mountain Laurel, Pitch Pine
 and Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea </i> quaternata).  The thinness
 of the leaf mat was conspicuous here.<p>
  Bryophyte
 sample # 26 was now taken from a decaying Tuliptree. Only the
 following were found: 
  <ul>
 <p><i>Brachythecium
 rutabulum, Campylium chrysophyllum, Fissidens osmundioides,
 Pylaisiella selwynii</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p> However,
 another sample (# 27) from a a living Tuliptree contained a richer
 assemblage:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Anomodon
 attenuatus, Brotherella recurvans, Campylium chrysophyllum,
 Cololejeunea biddlecomiae </i>(Li),<i>
 Dicranum viride, Frullania brittoniae </i>(Li),<i>Haplohymenium 
 triste, Lejeunea sp </i> (Li), <i>Metzgeria furcata </i>(Li),
 <i>Pylaisiella selwynii, Radula complanata </i>(Li),<i>Thuidium 
 delicatulum, Tortella humilis, Taxiphyllum deplanatum</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p> We
 now came to the east channel of the North River and, on crossing,
 entered a forest markedly different from that just traversed. Mature
 but young, the canopy was dominated by deciduous trees with a heavy
 White Pine understory and abundant Mountai Laurel in places. Perhaps
 the most common canopy species was Northern Red Oak, but White Oak
 and Tuliptree were also conspicuous and were accompanied by
 scattered Cucumbertree and Chestnut Oak. It seems likely that the
 latter occurred here by virtue of the greater relief as compared
 with other parts of the flood plain. Quite generally, Witch Hazel
 was the most common shrub.<p>
  Bryophyte
 sample # 28 was collected fromsandstone rock here. It bore the
 following:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Dicranum
 viride, Hedwigia ciliata, Hypnum pallescens, Platygyrium repens,
 Thuidium delicatulum, Ulota hutchinsiae</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p> After
 noting the presence of New York Fern, a soil sample (no 11) was
 taken. the pH value obtained for this sample was 4.6 both initially
 and after 24 hours.<p>
  The
 next three bryophyte samples were taken from the bark of
 undifferentiated deciduous trees.<p>
<b>  From #
 29:</b><p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Anomodon
 attenuatus, Anomodon rostratus, Campylium chrysophyllum,
 Cololejeunea biddlecomiae </i>(Li),
 <i>Fissidens osmundioides, Frullania brittoniae</i> (Li),
 <i>Haplohymenium triste, Homomallium adnatum, Lophocolea 
 cuspidatum</i> (Li), <i>Orthotrichum </i>sp, <i>Platygyrium 
 repens, Porella platyphylla </i>(Li), <i>Ulota crispa</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p><b> From
 # 30:</b><p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Anomodon
 attenuatus, Campylium chrysophyllum, Dicranum viride, Entodon 
 cladorrhizans, Fissidens adiathoides, Mnium affine, Platygyrium 
 repens, Thuidium delicatulum</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p> <b>And
 from # 31:</b><p>
 <ul>
 <p><i>Cololejeunea
 biddlecomiae </i>(Li),
 <i>Frullania brittoniae</i> (Li), <i>Halohymenium triste,</i>
 <i>Platygyrium repens</i><p>
 </ul>
 <p> Still
 advancing across the valley, we saw the grass <i>Brachyelytrum 
 erectum</i>, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, Lance-leaf Wild Liquorice
 (<i>Galium lanceolatum</i>), a little Partridge Berry, Red Maple,
 Scattered Mountain Laurel and Indian Cucumberrot (<i>Medeola 
 virginiana</i>). <p>
 
 <p> Here
 bryophyte sample # 32 was collected from the bark of a large
 Northern Red Oak. The following species were found:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Brotherella
 recurvans, Dicranell</i>
 sp (no sporophyte), <i>Dicranum viride, Frullania</i> 
 <i>brittoniae</i> (Li), <i>Pylaisiella selwynii, Ulota crispa</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p> After
 recording White Basswood (<i>Tilia heterophylla</i>) we arrived at
 the west channel of the North River, where we found Black Locust and
 Black Birch.<p>
  Our
 last bryophyte sample (# 33) was here collected from soil near the
 stream embankment. Found were:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Atrichum
 undulatum, Colopogeia muelleriana </i>(Li),<i>
 Dicranella heteromalla, Hypnum curvifolium, Hypnum pallescens,
 Leucobryum glaucum, Thuidium delicatulum</i><p>
  </ul>
 <p> Also
 on the embankment we found a single small shrub of Buffalonut (
 <i>Pyrularia pubera</i>), Flowering Dogwood, <i>Carex gracillima</i>,
 while in the stream bed grew <i>Carex scabrata</i>., as well as
 Twisted Sedge (<i>Carex torta</i>). <p>
  We
 now began our return toward the east on a somewhat different route
 than on which we had advanced. We soon encountered a rather deeply
 incised springbrook, which revealed the rather substantial relief of
 this inter-stream area, and likely explains the presence of Chestnut
 Oak. The springbrook was in its upper reaches marked by a large
 patch of Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>). <p>
  As
 we followed the springbrook down-stream to where the water was
 clearly flowing, we noted Golden Saxifrage (<i>Chrysosplenium 
 americanum</i>) as well as a number of other herbs we did not
 inventory.<p>
  Again
 arriving at the east channel of the River, we recorded the fungi
 <i>Hygrophorus aurantiaca </i>on soil and <i>Coltricia perennis</i>
 on soil at the edge of burned wood. These were accompanied by Stiff
 Yellow Flax (<i>Linum medium</i>) on the rocky stream bank. At
 this point we terminated our traverse.<p>
  The
 following are bryophyte frequencies in the foregoing 12 habitats.<p>

 <p> The
 striking difference between the forest east of the River (largely
 White Pine and Hemlock) and the largely deciduous forest on the
 inter-stream area, may have several explanations. It may relate to
 different land uses during the settler period, or to cutting or
 fire history, with one favoring conifers, the other deciduous
 species. That the conifers once also dominated the canopy where the
 deciduous forest now occurs, is at least hinted at by the vigorous
 White Pine understory in the latter. An additional contributing
 factor may be the relatively high relief of the interstream area,
 which would tend to favor certain species such as Chestnut Oak.<p>
  Beginning
 at 9:30 AM on 9- 28 -01, under clear, cool conditions, a brief
 inventory was undertaken of the forest immediately south of the
 first bridge and west of the road. The elevation here is a little
 less than 2100 feet (640) asl.<p>
  Near
 the road Black Oak was a conspicuous canopy species, but associated
 with it were Northern Red and White Oaks and White Pine. The ground
 flora was very dense. Successively noted as we traversed toward the
 Valley's west side were Flowering Dogwood, Slender-flowered Muhly,
 Christmas Fern, Interrupted Fern, Hog Peanut, Common Greenbrier, the
 grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, Canada Brome Grass, White
 Snakeroot and Partridge Berry. Subsequently we encountered the first
 Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>) seen by us in the entire
 Valley. This was followed by Variable Panic Grass, the pignut <i>Carya
 glabra</i>, Palmate-leaf Violet (<i>Viola palmata</i>), more
 White Pine, Upland Low Blueberry, White Wood Aster, Tall Agrimony (
 <i>Agrimonia gryposepala</i>), Wild Geranium, Black Cohosh, Witch
 Hazel, Wild Liquorice, White Oak and Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum 
 lanuginosum</i>).  Farther along, we saw Dog Violet (<i>Viola 
 conspersa</i>), the grass <i>Panicum boscii,</i> a single plant of
 <i>Desmodium nudiflorum</i>, an unidentified azalea (<i>Rhododendron
 </i> sp), a Black Cherry sapling, a single shrub of Spice Bush, Hay
-scented Fern, a single sapling of Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya 
 virginiana</i>), Virginia Creeper, seedlings of Downy Serviceberry,<i>
 Carex laxiflora, </i>Fowl Mannagrass (<i>Glyceria striata</i>), 
 Deer-tongue grass, Woodland Muhly, Common Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum
 biflorum</i>), the creeping five-leaf <i>Poentilla canadensis</i>,
 Enchanter's Nightshade (<i>Circaea </i> <i>quadrisulcata</i>),  
 Multiflora Rose (<i>Rosa multiflora</i>), Blunt-lobe Hepatica,
 Calico Aster (<i>Aster lateriflorus</i>) and Common Speedwell.<p>
  Continuing
 west across the flood plain, we encountered Autumn Bent Grass (
 <i>Agrostis perennans</i>), Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria pubera</i>
), Four-leaved Yam, a seedling of an unidentified <i>Eupatorium</i>,
 an unidentified <i>Atrichum</i> moss, European Self-heal, the
 alien grass <i>Microstegium vimineum </i>and a few plants of the
 first noted Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigaea repens</i>). <p>
  Also
 noted was the common occurrence of cushions of an unidentified
 species of <i>Leucobryum</i> moss at the bases of White Pine, an
 unidentified fungus of the genus <i>Hydnellum</i>, Red Maple, Mealy
 Bellwort (<i>Uvularia perfoliata</i>), Mountain Anemone (<i>Anemone
 lancifolia </i>or <i>A. minima</i>) golden Alexanders (<i>Zizia 
 aptera</i>), Hemlock, Sweet White Violet, Witch Hazel, Plume Lily,
 Deer Berry. a Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (S<i>phyrapicus varius</i>), 
 the fungus <i>Collybia dryophylla,</i> Delicate Fern Moss on soil;
 then Downy Rattlesnake Plantain and patches of a grass later
 identified as Two-flower Melic (<i>Melica mutica</i>), a
 southern species. Also present in the vicinity was a large patch of
 <i>Calamagrostis porteri, </i>New York fern, Carrion Flower, Blue
 Wood Aster, Variable Panic Grass, abundant Partridge Berry,
 seedlings of White Ash, Lady Fern and<p>
 Wrinkled
-leaf Goldenrod. With this we terminated our inventory. <p>

 <h2>Source
 Walks: 5-23-02 and 5-24-02</h2>
 <ul>
  On
 5-23-02 a camp was established in the vicinity of the previously
 mentioned sinkhole pond in the North River Valley. 
 <p> A
 little after noon we began our inventory along the northeast side of
 the pond. Successively noted were Woodland Strawberry and 
 <i>Potentilla canadensis</i> in bloom, while in the pond itself
 numerous i.5 inch (4 cm) polywogs crowded the water, Sedges
 included <i>Carex intumescens </i>mostly set several meters back
 from the water's edge, <i>Carex </i> <i>blanda, Carex laevivaginata</i>
 and <i>Carex atlantica</i>, Deer-tongue Grass, Golden Ragwort in
 bloom, Pennsylvania Bittercress, Indian Turnip, abundant <i>Juncus 
 effusus,</i> the calls of Scarlet Tanager and Black-billed Cuckoo.<p>
  Continuing,
 we saw on adjacent higher ground, a few clumps Kentucky Bluegrass, (
 <i>Poa pratensis</i>), <i>Carex swanii, Carex appalachica, Carex
 cephalophora, Carex laxiflora,</i> a clump of the forest
 &quot;bluegrass&quot; <i>Poa alsodes</i>, the wood rush <i>Luzula 
 echinata</i>, Wild Pink (<i>Silene caroliniana</i> var 
 <i>pensylvanica</i>) with white blooms, a little May Apple and the
 blue-eyed grass <i>Sisyrinchium angustifolium. </i>Heard also,
 was the call of an Ovenbird.<p>
  Now,
 moving down-stream along the east side of the springbrook, below
 the pond outlet, we saw Pennsylvania Wedge Grass (<i>Sphenopholis 
 pensylvanicum</i>), <i>Carex </i> <i>frankii, Carex lurida, Carex 
 amphibola </i>and a Meadow Fritillary (<i>Bolaria toddi ammiralis
 </i>) on Golden Ragwort. Observed on the adjacent upland were the
 coastal &quot;bluegrass&quot; <i>Poa autumnalis, Carex wildenowii</i>,
 One-flowered Broomrape (<i>Orobanche uniflora</i>), Yellow
 Stargrass (<i>Hypoxis hirsuta</i>), both in bloom, and Hairy
 Bittercress (<i>Cardamine hirsuta</i>) in seed. Also identified
 here was Southern Dewberry (<i>Rubus enslenii</i>). <p>
  Of
 interest also, was an opportunity to observe an additional
 characteristic of the deciduous spinulose shield fern <i>Dryopteris 
 carthusiana</i>, namely its smooth indusia, to reinforce
 identification by the forms of its pinnae. 
 <p> Other
 birds heard and / or seen were Pileated Woodpecker and yellow -
 rumped warbler (<i>Dendroica coronata</i>). <p>
  We
 saw earlier that as compared with Ramsey's Draft, the open nature of
 this Valley does not so much favor boreal species, and that these
 apparently have a diminished presence down-valley. However an
 apparent local exception to this was found just east of the pond.
 There, under a young but mature and small stand of planted Red Pine
 (<i>Pinus resinosa</i>), we discovered a patch, perhaps 5 meters
 across, of Canada Mayflower. In association were numerous seedlings
 of Red Maple, Partridge Berry, <i>Potentilla canadensis</i>,
 seedlings of Downy Serviceberry and cushions of <i>Leucobryum</i>
 moss. it is tempting to speculate that the Red Pine created a
 particularly favorable environment for this herb.<p>
  We have
 already referred to the abundant macrolichens on trees in the
 vicinity of the pond. A collection of these was made by R. Hunsucker
 and these were identified by Don Flenniken (Flenniken, 1999).  They
 are listed as follows:<p>
  <ul>
 <i>Allocetraria
 oakesiana</i><br>
 <i>Cladonia
 coniocraea</i><br>
 <i>Evernia

  </ul>
 <p> During
 the evening of 5-23-02 Green Frogs (<i>Rana clamitans</i>) 
 and Spring Peepers (<i>Pseudacris crucifer</i>) were heard
 calling from the pond and &quot;punkies&quot; (Ceratopogonidae) 
 were quite annoying, but were little in evidence at nightfall.<p>
  Our
 efforts on the morning of 5-24-02 began with a soil temperature
 determination (T-411) near camp at a site with a flat aspect and
 in moist soil under a large White Pine. The value obtained at the
 usual depth of 5 inches (13 cm) was T= 11.0 deg C.<p>
  Our
 next inventories were undertaken in the vicinity of Trout Run, about
 a mile northwest of Camp Todd. First inventoried was the North River
 flood plain immediately east of the road. It began with the
 observation of an Indigo Bunting (<i>Passerina cyanea</i>) and an
 Eastern Garter Snake (<i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>).  After
 descending the steep bank to a lower terrace, a soil temperature (T
-412) was taken on a flat aspect under a heavy oak leaf mat. A
 value of T= 10.5 deg C was obtained.<p>
  The
 forest here was mature but clearly young and the canopy was
 dominated by White Pine, Adelgid infested Hemlock, Northern Red,
 White and Chestnut Oaks, Shagbark Hickory and Red Maple, with a
 little Sugar Maple, Black Birch, and Cucumbertree. A single mature
 White Ash was seen. Seedlings of Red Maple and White Pine were very
 common and those of Northern Red Oak almost as common. Seedlings of
 Sugar Maple and White Ash had a scattered presence and those of
 Cucumbertree occurred in a few spots in the vicinity of mature
 trees. A few seedlings and saplings of Hemlock were also seen. The
 most abundant shrub appeared to be Mountain Laurel. but Witch Hazel
 was also present.<p>
  Herbs
 appeared to be dominated by Canada Mayflower,. Partridge Berry,
 Round-leaf Violet, New York Fern, Bluets (<i>Houstonia caerulea</i>
) in bloom and <i>Medeola</i>. Less common were blooming Downy Wood
 Violet, Christmas Fern, Golden Ragwort, also in bloom, <i>Potentilla
 canadensis / simplex</i>, Native Self-heal (<i>Prunella 
 vulgaris </i>var <i>lanceolata</i>), White Wood Aster, Indian
 Turnip, <i>Carex pensylvanica, C. laxiflora, C.</i> <i>platyphylla,
 C. digitalis,</i> Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia 
 sessilifolia</i>), Mealy Bellwort, possible Halberd-leaved Violet
 (<i>Viola hastata</i>), Purple Bedstraw (<i>Galium </i>
 <i>latifolium</i>) and both Interrupted and Cinnamon Ferns. Still
 rarer plants were represented by a single example of the tick -
 trefoil <i>Desmodium nudiflorum,</i> Miterwort (<i>Mitella 
 diphylla</i>), the forest &quot;bluegrass&quot; <i>Poa </i>
 <i>alsodes</i>, a few plants of Teaberry, scattered stunted Hairy
 Disporum, a single Rattlesnake Fern, a single blooming plant of the
 alien Wintercress (<i>Barbarea vulgaris</i>), and a few plants,
 also in bloom, of Gaywings (<i>Poylgala paucifolia</i>). 
 Unidentified species of <i>Leucobryum </i>and<i>Dicranum </i>mosses
 were common.<p>
  Other
 fauna noted here were the birds Acadian Flycatcher (<i>Empidonax 
 virescens</i>), Red-eyed Vireo, Black-throated Green Warbler (
 <i>Dendroica virens</i>) and Scarlet Tanager and a Silver -
 spotted Skipper (<i>Epargyreus clarus</i>). <p>
  A temperature reading (T-413) was also taken of one of several 
 springbrooks on the North River flood plain. T= 11.0 deg C was
 obtained.<p>
  A collection of macrolichens from sandstone rock was also made here by
 R. Hunsucker, and these were identified by Don Flenniken, with the
 following result:<p>
  <ul>
 <i>Anaptychia palmulata</i> <br>
 <i>Lobaria quercizans</i> <br>
 <i>Myelochroa aurulenta</i> <br>
 <i>Peltigera leucophlebia</i>-evidently a highland species<br>
 <i>Phaeophyscia adiastola</i><br> 
 <i>Sticta beauvoisii</i>  
  </ul>
 <p> We
 now moved to the upland forest west of the road and along the south
 side of Trout Run. The terrain here is very rocky, with so many
 large sandstone cobbles and rock fragments that it was difficult to
 insert a probe for a soil temperature determination (T-414). 
 However, this temperature, on a small slope with an east aspect, was
 found to be T = 11.5 deg C.<p>
  The
 canopy here was dominated by White, Chestnut, Black and Northern Red
 Oaks, with Red Maple, Adelgid ravaged Hemlock, White Pine and Black
 Birch. Striped Maple was common and a shrub layer consisted of
 Mountain Laurel, Mountain Fetterbush, Witch Hazel and Upland Low
 Blueberry. The leaf mat was very heavy, with a sparse ground flora
 of Four-leaf Yam, Sessile-leaved Bellwort and Mountain Bellwort.
 However this terrain appeared to be suitable to the Ovenbird, since
 several were heard calling.<p>
  The
 following is a list of macrolichens collected along Trout Run by R.
 Hunsucker and identified by Don Flenniken:<p>
  <ul>
 <i>Anaptychia
 palmulata</i>
-in moss<br>
 <i>Cladonia

  </ul>
 <p> An
 additional set of macrolichens was collected by R. Hunsucker in a
 sandstone boulder opening on the upland slope south of Trout Run.
 These were identified by Don Flenniken with the following result:<p>
  <ul>
 <p><i>Allocetraria

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
 <p> We
 have already dwelt upon the characteristics of elevation,
 orientation and form that contribute the Valley's floristics. We
 have found that, despite many similarities to Ramsey's Draft, these
 characteristics probably account for some of the observed
 differences from the latter. While similar in elevation and
 proximity to high elevation slopes, the North River Valley's broad
 opening to the southeast does not allow the same entrapment of
 subsiding cold air as does the more constricted Valley of Ramsey's
 Draft. However, there is also a possibility that the distribution of
 boreal plants in the North River Valley is to a degree influenced by
 conditions during the settler period, when certain plants,
 particularly those of the lily family, may have been selectively
 consumed by livestock, as discussed in the last paragraph. 
 <p> The
 area also presents the usual opportunities for other studies
 relative to forest stability (Mueller, 2000).  For example, our
 observations here contributed to the determination of the stability
 field of Coral Berry with respect to pH and raised questions
 regarding that of the deciduous spinulose shield fern <i>Dryopteris 
 carthusiana, </i>as well as that of Great Rhododendron. The single
 occurrence of the latter, perhaps unique in the entire region,
 appears to substantiate the dependence of the species on higher soil
 and air moisture levels than those that prevail here. In any case,
 it seems to eliminate the possibility of the lack of seed sources.<p>
  In
 addition to the vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens present
 their own challenges. It is of interest to compare the bryophyte
 frequencies with those of Cathedral State Park, Tea Creek and the
 vicinity of Reddish Knob. The substantial differences in forest type
 in these areas are clearly reflected in these frequencies A direct
 comparison of a type is provided by the common species <i>Platygyrium
 repens, Anomodon attenuatus,</i> <i>Campylium chrysophyllum</i>
 and <i>Frullania brittoniae</i>. In the two major frequency series
 from North River these four species show the highest frequencies. Of
 these, two species <i>Platygyrium repens </i>and <i>Anomodon 
 attenuatus,</i> are also among the four most frequent in the
 vicinity of Reddish Knob. However, in the series from Tea Creek,
 only one, namely <i>Anomodon attenuatus, </i>appears among the four
 most frequent, while not one is found among the most frequent at
 Cathedral State Park. The same is also true of the small series of
 frequencies from North River, but this is likely a consequence of
 the unusual habitats, including a wetland, represented by the
 series. Because our systematic study of the lichens is in its
 initial stage, there is, unlike in the case of the bryophytes, still
 no basis of comparison of different areas or forest types.<p>
 As
 alluded to earlier, there is also another major difference between
 this valley and Ramsey's Draft.. The latter, perhaps because of its
 relative narrowness. rocky floor and catastrophic flooding, did not
 lend itself to agriculture during the settler period. Indeed the
 survival there of much old growth forest strongly supports this
 conclusion. By contrast, the North River Valley retains abundant
 evidence in the form of young forest, old fields, rock piles and
 other features of settler activity and residence. Sadly it is also
 evident in a generally depauperate flora, although there is no
 reason to believe that bedrock and original soils differed much in
 the two valleys. Indeed, nothing comparable to the circum- neutral
 sinkhole pond and wetland that points to some carbonate beds at
 North River, has been found at Ramsey's Draft. Although we found of
 the order of 250 species of vascular plants at North River, many of
 these are aliens or early successional natives associated with
 openings and disturbed areas. In contrast with Ramsey's Draft, where
 there are rich and luxuriant shrub and herb floras consisting of
 native forest interior species, most of the North River forest
 tracts have only sparse shrub and ground floras with many sensitive
 species missing or present only as traces. An example is the genus
 <i>Desmodium</i>, of which only three individuals were found! Other
 examples are Black Cohosh, Blue Cohosh, many lily family species and
 even May Apple. Most of the absentees are vulnerable to livestock
 grazing and browsing, while those that remain, such as Partridge
 Berry and the ferns, are not. A particular threat was the hogs
 frequently kept by the settlers., since these consumed the roots
 and bulbs of the perennials that dominate these floras. Thus the
 problem and goal at North River is one of restoration, and this can
 best be attained through wilderness designation.<p>
 Finally,
 nothing so well illustrates the importance of river valleys and
 flood plains in particular to the regional ecologic mosaic as the
 sinkhole pond and the associated flora. Such watery assets are
 magnets to a great variety of wildlife that can find their amenities
 nowhere else. However in a non-wilderness setting many of these
 amenities are lost because the vicinity is subject to frequent
 disturbance by our machine culture. Thus such areas should have high
 priority for inclusion in wilderness areas, as is recognized in our
 Ernie Dickerman proposal.<p>
