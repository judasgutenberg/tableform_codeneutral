<h1>Peaks of Otter</h1>
<ul>
<P>
<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<P>
 The Peaks of Otter consist of two prominences, Sharp
Top and Flat Top, that stand at the eastern edge of the Blue Ridge
northwest of Bedford, Virginia.  Rising to 4000 ft. (1220 meters)
asl, they form part of a massif of Pre-Cambrian Charnockite rock
of Grenville Age (about a billion years old).  Compositionally
this rock consists of massive to vaguely foliated pyroxene-bearing
granite and granodiorite with a variety of feldspars and ferromagnesian
minerals.  Thus it is rich in potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron,
phosphorus and other elements that are vital to plant growth and
which characterize the eastern Blue Ridge in general .  Since
both peaks show a strong pattern of radial drainage, a fairly
homogeneous rock is indicated for the massif.  Although the terrain
is rugged, the climate lacks the harshness of the more inland
ranges and the Piedmont and foothill area just east of the Peaks
boasts a growing season of 200 days (Gottmann, 1955).  Also, although
the mean annual precipitation in the Blue Ridge immediately to
the northeast exceeds 47 inches (120 cm), it drops to 41 inches
(105 cm) at the Peaks of Otter (Hayden, 1979).
<P>
 The Blue Ridge Parkway passes just northwest of
the Peaks, which are contained in a 4000 acre (1620 hectare) tract
of National Parkland contiguous with the Parkway.  Consequently
the Peak region is fully protected and is rapidly transforming
to natural mature forest with many of the attributes of old growth.
 There are many large old trees with some exceeding 4 ft. (1.2
meters) dbh and which may date to the primary forest.  The diverse
vertical and horizontal structures of this forest, with its abundant
large woody debris, tree fall gaps, talus slopes, and other features,
creates rich habitat for flora and fauna alike. <BR>
</ul>
<P>
<h2>Harkening Hill Drainage</h2>
<ul>
<P>
<B>Source Walk: 12-26-94</B>
<P>
 A brief inventory was done along a small stream
in a ravine that cuts the slope of 3100 ft. (940 meters) Harkening
Hill directly across the Parkway from SharpTop Peak.  The stream,
which is a headwater branch of Little Stony Creek, flows southeast
and this is also the general aspect of the ravine.  The area inventoried
ranges between 2500 and 2600 ft (760 and 790 meters) asl.  The
canopy is dominated by Tuliptree with lesser amounts of Northern
Red Oak, Black Cherry, White Ash, White Pine, Black Birch, Red
Maple, Black Locust, Yellow Birch and partially defoliated Canada
Hemlock (<I> Tsuga canadensis</I> ).  The undergrowth contains
much Spice Bush (<I> Lindera benzoin</I> ) and some Coral Berry
( <I>Symphoricarpos orbiculatus </I>).  A single Black Walnut
was noted.  Yellow Birch increases significantly a little upstream
from the road and becomes more common than Black Birch.  There
are also Black, White and Chestnut Oaks.  A few dead American
Chestnut (<I> Castanea dentata </I>) trunks lay on the ground.
 Christmas Fern (<I> Polystichum acrostichoides</I> ) is common
and the persistent green of their leaves revealed such plants
as Common Speedwell (<I> Veronica officinalis </I>), Crinkled
Hair Grass (<I>Deschampsia flexuosa</I>), Marginal Shield Fern
( <I>Dryopteris marginalis</I> )and the basal leaves of Golden
Ragwort (<I> Senecio aureus </I>).  Mosses noted were Fern (<I>Thuidium</I>)
and the Tree Moss (<I>Climacium americanum</I>).  Where the soil
is shady and seepy there may be found the thallus liverwort <I>Conocephalum
conicum</I> (easily identified by its polygonal surface and pleasant
aroma), and lettuce Saxifrage (<I>Saxifraga micranthidifolia</I>)
as well.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<h2>Sharp Top</h2>
<ul>
<P>
<B>Source Walk: 12-26-94 and 5-7-96</B>
<P>
 On 12-26-94 a traverse was made along the entire
length of the trail to the summit, whereas on 5-7-96, a cold rainy
day (Temperature at about 44&#176; F/7&#176; C), the traverse
extended only to the 2900 ft (890 meters) level.  Start of the
trail is at 2550 ft (780 meters) asl.  Here, and for some distance
along the lower slope the canopy consists of Northern Red, Black
and Chestnut Oaks, Black Birch, Red Maple, White Ash, Shagbark
and Pignut Hickories, Tuliptree, Cucumber Magnolia, Black Cherry,
Black Locust,Canada Hemlock and White Pine, Understory consists
of Flowering Dogwood (<I> Cornus florida </I>), some Alternate-leaf
Dogwood ( <I>C.alternifolia </I>)and Striped Maple ( <I>Acer</I>
<I>pensylvanicum </I>), and the shrub layer of abundant Spice
Bush, with Witch Hazel (<I> Hamamelis virginiana </I>), Black
Haw Viburnum ( <I>Viburnum prunifolium </I>), Pinxter Azalea (<I>Rhododendron
nudiflorum</I>), there beginning to bloom, Smooth Gooseberry (<I>Ribes
rotundifolium</I>), also blooming, Black Raspberry (<I>Rubus occidentalis</I>),
Allegheny Blackberry (<I>Rubus allegheniensis</I>) and Maple-leaf
Viburnum ( <I>V. acerifolium </I>) There is also a scattering
of Mountain Laurel ( <I>Kalmia latifolia </I>), Catawba Rhododendron
(<I> Rhododendron catawbiense </I>)and Upland Low Blueberry (
<I>Vaccinium pallidum</I> ) in dryer more acid areas.  Poison
Ivy ( <I>Rhus radicans </I>)is a common vine.  A 40 inch (1 meter)
dead oak in this area that had been cut near the trail, yielded
a ring count of slightly more than 100 years, indicating excellent
growing conditions, a conclusion also supported by the good forms
of trees on the slope.
<P>
 The herbaceous layer here appeared to be dominated
by Virginia Waterleaf ( <I>Hydrophyllum virginianum </I>), Great
Chickweed (<I> Stellaria pubera )</I>, Hairy Sweet Cicely ( <I>Osmorhiza
claytoni </I>), Cut-leaf Toothwort (<I> Dentaria laciniata </I>)
and Rattlesnake Fern (<I> Botrychium virginianum</I> ).  Other
conspicuous herbs were Allegheny Crowfoot ( <I>Ranunculus allegheniensis
</I>), Christmas Fern, White Wood and Big-leaf Asters ( <I>Aster
divaricatus </I>and <I>A.macrophyllus </I>), Large-flowered Trillium
( <I>Trillium grandiflorum</I> ), Smooth Yellow Violet ( <I>Viola
pensylvanica </I>), Indian Turnip ( <I>Arisaema Triphyllum </I>),
Blood Root (<I> Sanguinaria canadensis </I>), White Snakeroot
( <I>Eupatorium rugosum </I>), Wild Ginger (<I> Asarum canadense</I>
), Plume Lily ( <I>Smilacina racemosa </I>), unknown species of
Lilies (<I> Lilium </I>sp ), Gall-of-the-Earth (<I> Prenanthes
</I>sp ), Virginia Avens (<I> Geum virginianum </I>), Wild Sarsaparilla
(<I> Aralia nudicaulis </I>), Wood Betany (<I> Pedicularis canadensis
</I>), the Wood Rush, <I>Luzula echinata</I>, a species of <I>Penstemon</I>,
a species of <I>Scrofularia</I>, Hooked Crowfoot (<I> Ranunculus
recurvatus</I>), a species of <I>Anemone</I>, Enchanters Nightshade
(<I>Circ&aelig;a quadrisulcata</I>), Smooth Rockcress (<I> Arabis
laevigata </I>), Wood Nettle ( <I>Laportea canadensis </I>), Mealy
bellwort ( <I>Uvularia perfoliata </I>), Indian Cucumber-root
( <I>Medeola virginiana </I>), May Apple ( <I>Podophyllum peltatum
</I>), Curtis Goldenrod ( <I>Solidago curtesii </I>), Downy Yellow
Foxglove (<I> Aureolaria virginica </I>), Filmy Angelica ( <I>Angelica
triquinata </I>), Wild Geranium ( <I>Geranium maculatum </I>),
Creeping Five-leaf (<I> Potentilla simplex/canadensis </I>), Poverty
Oat Grass ( <I>Danthonia spicata </I>) and the alien mint <I>Prunella
vulgaris</I>  or Selfheal, with the last three species concentrated
along the trail. An additional species , Showy Orchid (<I> Orchis
spectabilis </I>), then in bloom, occurred at fairly evenly-spaced
intervals directly adjacent to the trail, hinting that it may
have been planted.
<P>
 In a small ravine just west of the trail near the
start, there is a small wetland associated with a seep.  Here
were large vigorous plants of White Hellebore, Cinnamon Fern,
blooming Golden Ragwort and a lush growth of grasses and sedges
with a dense border of Spice Bush.
<P>
 Lichens were conspicuous on tree trunks and rocks
and included many foliose species.  However, only the common <I>Parmelia
rudecta</I>  was identified with confidence in the time available.
<P>
 Between 2700 and 2800 ft (820 and 850 meters) asl
Tuliptree appears to drop out except for scattered occurrences
at higher elevations.  Above the level at which the trail crossed
a road the aspect becomes increasingly westerly as the side of
a major ravine is traversed.  Here the forest becomes more dry
and ericaceous, Chestnut and other oaks dominate the canopy and
Mountain Laurel dominates the shrub layer.  Choke Cherry ( <I>Prunus
virginiana </I>) is also common in places.  In most acid areas
a pronounced mor layer caps the soil profile although no marked
horizons are visible in the soil below this.  Among the mosses
of the mor surface a <I>Dicranum</I>, probably<I>Dicranum scorparium</I>
and a species of <I>Leucobryum</I> are conspicuous.  Here also
was found the tiny "Wheat Moss" (<I>Diphyscium foliosum</I>).
 And growing on or among the mosses were fructicose and other
lichens, among which was a squamulose <I>Cladonia</I> (probably
<I>Cladonia squamosa</I>), adding a harmonious blend of subtle
colors.  Associated herbs were Rattlesnake Weed ( <I>Hieracium
venosum</I> ), Southern Bellflower ( <I>Campanula divaricata </I>),
Summer Bluets (<I>Houstonia </I>sp.), Mountain Bellwort (<I> Uvularia
pudica </I>), Wood Betony, Hairy Hawkweed (<I> Hieracium gronovii</I>
)and Bootts Goldenrod (<I> Solidago boottii </I>).  In many places
on the upper trail bank, where light strikes beneath the shrubs,
there are vigorous clumps of the early blooming sedge,<I> Carex
pensylvanica,</I> its mops of bleached last year's foliage
visible from a distance.  It is interesting that in this apparently
highly acid environment this sedge grows larger and seems to be
more favored than on "better" soils of limestone
regions.  Also conspicuous here on down wood is the jelly fungus
<I>Tremella foleacea</I>.  In one place, under the overhanging
mor layers, on the trail bank, we disturbed a Junco (<I> Junco
hyemalis </I>), on what proved to be an egg-filled nest, here
at perhaps 2700 ft (820 meters) asl.
<P>
 Above 2800 ft (850 meters) the mountain rises in
more dramatic slopes.  In mesic areas the canopy consists of Black
Birch, Red Maple, Northern Red Oak, White Ash, and instead of
Tuliptree, Basswood.  Witch Hazel is abundant in the shrub layer.
 Soon huge residual rounded outcroppings of rock with lush coverings
of Rock Tripe and <I>Polypodium virginianum</I> or Rock Fern appear.
 In December sparse greenery, in addition to the Rock Fern, is
virtually confined to Marginal Shield Fern and an Alum Root (<I>Heuchera</I>
 sp.).  At nearly 3500 ft. (1070 meters) asl virtually all Chestnut
Oak has been left behind and has been replaced by Northern Red
Oak.  However there is still a little White and Black Oak.  Pignut
Hickory seemingly has become more abundant and Hophornbeam has
put in an appearance in the understory.  Where massive talus litters
the slope, abundant Mountain Maple (<I>Acer spicatum</I>) shoots
and sprouts grow between the blocks and have the appearance of
having been repeatedly sheared or browsed off.  A little farther
on Catawba Rhododendron again appears, and Rock and Marginal Shield
Ferns as well as Alum Root all increase in abundance.
<P>
 Where the trail reaches the saddle between the lesser
prominence of "Buzzard Roost" and Sharp Top, at near
3500 ft (1070 meters), a single sapling of Tuliptree holds an
outpost, illustrating again the fortuitous survival capability
of trees out of their range with the aid of nearby seed sources.
<P>
 At this point the trail swings sharply left in its
ascent of Sharptop.  Although Northern Red Oak with increasingly
"orchard" form dominate these heights, there are
a few White Oak, some up to 30 inches (.75 meters) dbh and equally
deformed.  Here also we encountered some large budded hickories
but with bark unlike either Mockernut or Shagbark and a few White
Ash as well.  As the trail climbs above 3600 ft (1100 meters)
the oaks, and particularly White Oak, become increasingly stunted
and element-battered until the latter species vanishes entirely.
 However, Service Berry ( probably <I>Amelanchier arborea </I>)
seems to increase in abundance with elevation.
<P>
 Among the great rounded outcroppings and residual
rocks of the summit area Northern Red Oak appears to be the only
oak.  It is accompanied however by stunted Yellow Birch, abundant
and vigorous Witch Hazel, Mountain Laurel and Catawba Rhododendron.
 There also appears to be a little Wild Hydrangea  (<I>Hydrangea
arborescens  )</I>, possibly Ninebark (<I>Physocarpus opulifolius</I>)
and a Blackberry (probably <I>Rubus allegheniensis</I>).  However
the most unusual occurrence is Broadleaf Meadowsweet (<I>Spir&aelig;a
latifolia</I> var. <I>latifolia</I>) readily identified by its
reddish panicle and old seeds.
<P>
 Among herbs, one of the most abundant showing a
winter presence is Michaux's Saxifrage (<I>Saxifraga michauxii</I>),
a rare inhabitant of a few isolated Central Appalachian peaks.
 Another curiosity, and possibly even rarer than the saxifrage,
were a few still-green plants of Marsh Speedwell (<I>Veronica
scutellata</I>), a northern plant near its southern limit and
most commonly found in wetlands.  However here it grew in moist
pockets under overhanging rock.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<h2>Flat Top</h2>
<ul>
<P>
<B>Source Walk 5-8-96, Partly cloudy, pleasant</B>
<P>
 The traverse here extended from the Flat Top mountain
Overlook at about 2500 ft (760 meters) asl to the Flat Top summit
at 4001 ft (1219.5 meters).  Aspects ranged from near east over
the initial section through northwest in the central part and
near northeast in the last section.  The weather varied from partly
cloudy to sunny with temperatures in the range of 60 to 70&#176;F
(16 to 21&#176; Centigrade).
<P>
 In the first section the trail extends over gentle
terrain with a dominantly eastern aspect.  Here the canopy consists
of an impressive secondary stand of predominantly Tuliptree, straight
and tall, with many exceeding 2 ft. (0.6 meters) dbh.  Other canopy
species include White Ash, Black Oak, Black Cherry, Pignut and
Mockernut Hickories, Black Locust and Red Maple.  Hophornbeam
(<I> Ostrya virginiana </I>), Flowering Dogwood and Striped Maple
(<I> Acer pensylvanicum </I>) form an understory and in some places
there is considerable feral domestic cherry (<I>Prunus avium</I>?),
also of understory size.  Shrubs include Spice Bush, a little
<I>Hydrangea arborescens</I>, Maple-leaf Viburnum, Smooth Gooseberry
(<I>Ribes rotundifolium</I>), now in bloom, Black Raspberry and
Allegheny Blackberry, while vines are represented by Canada Moonseed
(<I>Menispermum canadense</I>), Poison Ivy, species of Grape and
Dutchmans Pipe Vine.
<P>
 The canopy here is quite open despite the abundant
large trees.  This openness results from many side limbs having
been sheared off, presumably by ice storms.  The effect is more
than usual light on the forest floor, which has, with the rich
soils, given rise to an extraordinarily lush and diverse herbaceous
ground cover.  At this season the prospect is one of bright and
varied colors of flowering plants, ranging from the white and
pink of Large-flowered Trillium to the Yellows of Bellworts and
Lady Slippers.  The wealth of this habitat is also reflected in
the birdlife which resulted in incessant morning calls and songs
as well as flashes of bright plumage to complement the floral
scene.
<P>
 What follows is a tabulation of the herbaceous species
in this first section of the traverse.  The list is the result
of a necessarily rapid transit of approximately 1/3 mile (0.5
km) with, however, careful references to manuals where necessary.
 Elevations range from 2500 to 2600 ft (760 to 790 meters) asl
and the species are listed in the order in which they were recorded.
 Both common and scientific names are presented to lend coherence.

 Of the many birds seen and/or heard in this section
of the traverse were Ovenbird (<I>Seiurus aurocapillus</I>), Hooded
Warbler (<I>Wilsonia citrina</I>), Towhee ( <I>Pipilo erythrophthalmus
</I>), Red-eyed Vireo (<I> Vireo olivaceus </I>), Wood Thrush
( <I>Hylochichla mustelina </I>), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (<I>
Pheucticus ludovicianus </I>) and Parula Warbler (<I>Parula americana</I>).
 Mole tunnels were conspicuous and a large (1.5 inch) Blister
Beetle, iridescent indigo in color and with yellow fluid emission
on disturbance, was an insect high point.
<p>
 It is likely that the 64 herbs recorded, and which
were mostly vernal flora, are but a fraction of the total present
in this rich mesic forest.  Indeed, the soil, where exposed by
tree falls, was deep, without obvious horizons, light brown in
color and seemingly a mull type that is usually associated with
mixed mesophytic communities.
<p>
 From 2600 to 2800 ft (790 to 850 meters) elevation
the trail crosses slopes with a northwest aspect and the forest
is still dominantly mesic, although the ground cover is not as
lush as that below.  This may in part be due to dryer conditions
and in part to a more closed canopy.  The latter contains more
oaks and especially Northern Red and Chestnut Oaks but also more
Pignut Hickory.  American Chestnut sprouts, which were not noted
below, are here common but Tuliptree drops out at about 2700 ft
(820 meters) asl.
<p>
 Many of the same species of plants as below persist
and maintain their abundances.  However a number of new species
also appear, and these, with a few prominents previously recorded,
are listed below in the sequence of observation.
<p>
Downy Solomons Seal (<I>Polygonatum pubescens</I>)
<br>
Maidenhair Fern (<I>Adiantum pedatum</I>)
<br>
Silvery Glade Fern (<I>Athyrium thelypterioides</I>)
<br>
a mystery plant! (???? sp.)
<br>
Golden Alexanders (<I>Zizia aptera</I>)
<br>
a grass (<I>Brachyelytrum erectum</I>)
<br>
Indian Cucumber-root (<I>Medeola virginiana</I>)
<br>
White Hellebore (<I>Veratrum viride</I>) (in a seep)
<br>
Wild Ginger (<I>Asarum canadense</I>) (with an obvious
prominence)
<br>
Mountain Holly (<I>Ilex montana</I>) (at 2700 ft
(820 meters), a little lower than usual)
<br>
a sedge (<I>Carex laxiflora</I>)
<br>
Bluebells (<I>Mertensia virginiana</I>) (seemingly
out of place)
<br>
Big-leaf Aster (<I>Aster macrophyllus</I>)
<br>
a <I>Clintonia</I> (probably <I>Clintonia umbellulata</I>)
<br>
Smooth Gooseberry (<I>Ribes rotundifolium</I>) (in
bloom)
<br>
Goats Beard (<I>Aruncus dioicus</I>)
<br>
Mountain Maple (<I>Acer spicatum</I>) (at base of
talus slope)
<p>
 On these slopes our attention was diverted by a
white butterfly, which proved to be a West Virginia White (<I>Pieris
virginiensis</I>).  It is said to prefer Two-leaved Toothwort
(<I>Dentaria diphylla</I>) as food, although only the Cut-leaved
species was seen here.
<p>
 Between 2800 and 3000 ft (850 and 910 meters) asl
the aspect remained much the same, but perhaps a little more west
than below.  The forest continued dry mesic with prominent Northern
Red Oak, Cucumber Magnolia, Shagbark Hickory and Basswood, which
here seemingly replaced Tuliptree.  Species either prominent or
newly noted, and in the sequence of observation are:
<p>
Wild Lily-of-the-Valley (<I>Convallaria montana</I>)
here in some places covering the slope
<br>
White Hellebore or perhaps another <I>Veratrum</I>,
abundantly scattered as small plants
<br>
Large-flowered Trillium, abundantly scattered and
in full bloom
<br>
Dutchmans Breeches in continued abundance
<br>
Wood Nettle
<br>
Choke Cherry (<I>Prunus virginiana</I>), abundant
and in bloom
<br>
Red Elderberry (<I>Sambucus pubens</I>), usually
an index of increasing elevation
<br>
Black Birch, abundant in places
<br>
Red Maple
<br>
Alum Root (<I>Heuchera americana</I>)
<br>
Dwarf Spir&aelig;a (<I>Spir&aelig;a corymbosa</I>),
in dryer areas
<br>
Beaked Hazelnut (<I>Corylus cornuta</I>), also reflecting
increased elevation.
<br>
Yellow-rumped Warbler (<I>Dendroica cornata</I>)
<br>
Downy Wood Violet (<I>Viola sororia</I>)
<br>
Skullcap (<I>Scutellaria arguta</I>)
<br>
a sedge (<I>Carex communis</I>)
<br>
Jewelweed (<I>Impatiens</I>  sp.)
<br>
Virginia Waterleaf
<br>
Choke Cherry
<br>
Cow Parsnip (<I>Heracleum maximum</I>), covering
slopes in places, making an impressive sight.
<br>
Lily (<I>Lilium</I> sp.)
<br>
Flowering Raspberry (<I>Rubus odoratus</I>)
<br>
Large-flowered Bellwort (<I>Uvularia grandiflora</I>)
a more demanding species than <I>U.</I> <I>perfoliata</I> ,which
we encountered below.
<p>
 Here we enter a dominantly Chestnut Oak forest with
Catawba Rhododendron (<I>Rhododendron catawbiense</I>), Upland
Low Blueberry (<I>Vaccinium pallidum</I>), Deer Berry (<I>Vaccinium
stamineum</I>), much Mountain Laurel and large rocks with abundant
Rock Tripe (<I>Lasallia populosa</I> and <I>Umbilicaria</I>  sp.).
<p>
 The next section of the trail extends from 3000
to 3400 ft (910 to 1040 meters) and although the last community
was dry and ericaceous, the habitat now becomes more mesic again
with the following sequence:
<p>
Downy Arrowwood (<I>Viburnum rafinesquianum</I>),
a somewhat rarely encountered shrub
<br>
Cow Parsnip, again covering part of the slope.
<br>
Large-flowered Trillium, still abundant and in full
bloom
<br>
Dutchmans Breeches
<br>
Virginia Waterleaf
<br>
Black Birch
<br>
Northern Red Oak
<br>
May Apple
<br>
A four inch millipede, brown with red stripes and
no detectable odor
<br>
Abundant Rock Tripe &oacute; at least three species
<br>
Hemlock, apparently Adelgid-free
<br>
Minnie-bush (<I>Menziesia pilosa</I>)
<br>
A Sooty-wing Skipper (<I>Pholisora</I>  sp.)
<br>
Filmy Angelica
<br>
Patches of abundant Canada Violet (<I>Viola canadensis</I>),
in full bloom
<br>
Hairy Heuchera (<I>Heuchera villosa</I>), a species
of Alum Root frequently associated with damp cliffs.
<br>
Yellow Birch&oacute;the first seen on the traverse
<br>
Interrupted Fern (<I>Osmunda claytoniana</I>).
<p>
 At this point elevation determination becomes more
precise.  At about 3450 ft (1050 meters) the trail crosses a fairly
prominent convexity or low spur.  Beyond this spur the trail crosses
a shallow concavity at 3500 ft (1066 meters) asl on which the
aspect is due north.  As a result the slope has abundant moisture
and exhibits all the floral beauty of wild harmony which has been
arrived at by life forms adjusted to each other's presence
from the start.  Most conspicuous are the glossy broad leaves
of the Ramp (<I>Allium tricoccum</I>) intergrown with Large-flowered
Trillium, Canada Violet, Blue Monks Hood, Cutleaf Toothwort, Virginia
Waterleaf and the first Mountain Aster (<I>Aster acuminatus</I>).
 Nearby also is the first Canada Mayflower ( <I>Maianthemum canadense
</I>) and, associated with rocks, Michaux's Saxifrage (
<I>Saxifraga michauxii </I>).  These are all under Yellow Birch,
Northern Red Oak, Mountain Maple and Striped Maple, in a faithful
reflection of elevation and aspect.  In addition there is also
a little Fly Poison (<I>Amianthium musc&aelig;toxicum</I>).  Large
residual rocks and cliffs in the area are covered with some of
the largest umbilicate lichens seen anywhere in these mountains.
 Beyond this point Rock Fern (<I>Polypodium virginianum</I>),
Michaux's Saxifrage and Canada Mayflower assume more prominence.
 However here we also again encounter Large-flowered Bellwort,
in testimony that the most demanding requirements of soil quality
are met in sheltered pockets among the rocks.
<p>
 Five hundred feet (150 meters) east of the concavity
the trail reaches "The Pinnacle" and climbs toward
the Flat Top summit through a terrain of large rounded rock exposures
and a forest dominated by stunted Northern Red Oak with minor
Yellow Birch, Black Cherry and clusters of apparently healthy
Canada Hemlock.  Witch Hazel , Choke Cherry (not yet in bloom
as below) and Catawba Rhododendron form a large shrub layer. 
In places there are luxuriant patches of Haircap Moss (<I> Polystichum
</I>sp ),while Fern Moss is common on boulders.  In places there
are patches of Allegheny Blackberry and just below and partly
within fissures of the highest summit rocks a few bushes of <I>Spir&aelig;a
latifolia</I>, a species also found on Sharp Top,ranges to Newfoundland
and which some regard as a variety of<I> Spir&aelig;a alba</I>.
 One of the most abundant herbs here is Mountain Bindweed (<I>Polygonum
cilinode</I>), a vine which sprawls over other vegetation and
is usually restricted to the highest elevations in the Central
Appalachians.  This plant seems more lush and vigorous here than
at any other occurrence known to the writer.  In places also there
are dense patches of Canada Mayflower intergrown with less abundant
Yellow Clintonia (<I>Clintonia borealis</I>), as well as independent
patches of Haircap Moss.  There are also a few plants of the <I>Veratrum</I>
that resembles <I>V. viride</I>, May Apple, a Blue Violet, <I>Danthonia</I>
 sp., Michaux's Saxifrage, and as elsewhere on the mountain,
beautiful Large-flowered Trillium in full bloom.  Seasonal variation
is however shown by the Trillium which is whiter and fresher appearing
at high elevation, more pink at lower elevations.
<p>
 While birds did not seem as abundant as below, a
female Rose-breasted Grosbeak was observed at close range in what
may have been a search for nesting sites by this bird.<p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
 The Peaks of Otter feature rich mesic slopes characteristic
of the eastern Blue Ridge and contrast sharply with the western
Blue Ridge and much of the Valley and Ridge province where, other
than the limestone and shale valleys,  sandstone and quartzite
ridges prevail.  Northern species such as Yellow Birch and Canada
Mayflower were not observed at lower elevations except for Yellow
Birch at Harkening Hill where cold air drainage/accumulation may
be involved.  In other low areas traversed, such as near Flat
Top Overlook, cold air can drain to still lower elevations without
accumulation, and all observed species are of wide-ranging or
southern character.  There is, however, a strong elevational effect
in the flora ranging from 2500 to 4000 ft (760 to 1200 meters)
asl.  There also appears to be a marked effect of aspect and slope
with dry ericaceous conditions on southwesterly slopes and the
most mesic conditions on slopes with a northern aspect.  While
rich, soils developed here do not appear to be quite as rich as
those developed on carbonate rocks under mesic conditions as reflected
in the absence of a number of eutrophic indicator species.  Also,
while some signs of past fires were observed at high elevation,
this agent does not appear to have been as great a factor as in
the dryer Valley and Ridge forests.
