<h1>Otter Creek</h1>
<p><b>Tucker and Randolph Counties, West
Virginia<br>December 1999</b>
<blockquote>


<p><b>General</b>
<ul>
<p> Otter Creek, a tributary of the Dry Fork of the Cheat
River, is almost encompassed by the federally - designated Otter Creek
Wilderness. In terms of geology it lies within the North Potomac Syncline (Cardwell
<i>et al</i>, 1968). Elevations in the
Watershed range from 1800 feet (549 m) at the confluence with the Dry Fork to
over 3800 feet (1159 m) asl on the rimming highlands. For some five miles the
Creek's lower course is over Mississippian Greenbrier Limestone, but exposure
of this rock is virtually confined to the Creek's bed and its proximity. Even
there and over much of the flood plain and terraces the limestone appears to be
concealed under coarse siliceous fluvial deposits. Immediately overlying the
Greenbrier Limestone is the Mauch Chunk Formation, also of Mississippian age,
and above this in turn, the Pottsville Formation of Pennsylvanian age. The
Pottsville, which is composed largely of erosion - resistant conglomeratic
sandstone, occupies mountain spurs above Otter Creek and finds its way there in
numerous rock falls and talus deposits. As a result the bed of Otter Creek is
occupied by some of the largest sized
boulders of any mountain stream bed viewed by this observer.
<p> Most of the middle and upper watershed is mapped by
the West Virginia Geologic Survey as occupied by rocks of the New River and
Kanawha Formations, which are roughly equivalent to the Pottsville, a
circumstance that is largely a consequence of the use of different source maps
for the two areas. However the size of the upstream watershed practically ensures
a greater variety of rocks than sandstone there.
<p> We shall see that the disposition of both bedrock and
transported rock types have a significant if not a profound effect on the
floristics of the Otter Creek Valley , and where different rocks are brought to
the surface the floras differ in detail and sometimes in gross aspect
<p> The forest vegetation here is characteristic of a
cool, moist regime that gives rise to a mixed mesophytic Appalachian flora at
the lowest elevations, mesic Hemlock - Northern Hardwoods at intermediate
levels and Spruce Montane above this. Dominant are such mesic species as
maples, birches, Beech, Black Cherry and at the lowest elevations, Tuliptree.
There are few oaks but Northern Red, and hickory is represented only by
scattered Shagbark and Bitternut. White Ash, Black Locust, Basswood, Cucumbertree
and a few other species are minor but widespread components at low and
intermediate elevations. Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) is
the dominant shrub in many places at all elevations, and the generally moist
acid - mesic regime has resulted in a wealth of mosses, liverworts and fungi.
Characteristic calciphile floras are associated with limestone where this is
exposed or a component of alluvium or colluvium.

<p><b>Source Walks: 8-9-99 and 8-10-99</b>
<ul>
<p> Presented here are the results of our somewat
detailed inventories conducted over a short distance along the lowest part of the
Otter Creek stream-side as well as a brief survey of the vicinity of the Dry
Fork.
<p> Our base of opperations was the trailhead parking lot
just east of the Dry Fork. From there two traverses were made crossing the dry
Fork and extending along the right bank of Otter Creek. Although the weather
was dry with comfortable temperatures during our stay, it was preceded on the
previous day by a significant drought-breaking rain that caused a rise in water
levels.
<p> The first part of our inventories, beginning a little
after noon on 8-9-99 at the parking lot, extended down the forested slope east
of the Dry Fork.The canopy here consisted of Sugar Maple, Black Cherry,
Tuliptree, Black Locust, White Ash and scattered Northern Red Oak, Shagbark
Hickory and Sassafras, with at least one of the latter of canopy height and 13
inches ( O.33 m ) dbh. Seedlings of Sugar Maple and Northern Red Oak were
common,and some of Red Maple and Bitternut Hickory were seen. Minor and
understory trees included Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>) , Hercules Club (<i>Aralia 
spinosa</i>) , and a little Fire Cherry (<i>Prunus pensylvanica</i>) . A
few alien cherry (<i>Prunus</i> sp ) were also seen. Shrubs noted were Black
Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>) , abundant Multiflora Rose (
<i>Rosa 
multiflora</i>) , Alternate-leaf Dogwood (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i>) , Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>) , possible Pennsylvania
Blackberry (<i>Rubus pensilvanicus</i>) and Winterberry Holly (<i>Ilex 
verticillata</i>) .
<p> Vines seen were Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax 
rotundifolia</i>) , Catbrier (<i>S. glauca</i>) and Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</i>) .
<p> Among herbs Virginia Knotweed (<i>Polygonum virginianum</i>) appeared
to be the most common, but others included Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca 
obtusa</i>) , Hairy Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza claytoni</i>) , White Baneberry (<i>Actaea pachypoda</i>) , Indian
Turnip (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>) , White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium 
rugosum</i>) , Downy Wood Violet (<i>
Viola sororia</i>) , Upright Yellow
Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis stricta</i>) , Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia 
quadrifolia</i>) , Deer-tongue Grass (<i>Panicum clandestinum</i>) ,
Bottlebrush Grass (<i>Elymus</i> <i>hystrix</i>
), Wreath Goldenrod (<i>Solidago caesia</i>) , Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria pubera</i>) , Calico Aster (
<i>Aster 
lateriflorus</i>) , White Avens (<i>Geum canadense</i>) , White Grass (<i>Leersia 
virginica</i>) in moist areas, Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum</i> <i>acrostichoides</i>) , New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris 
noveboracensis</i>) and Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>) . It
is likely that limestone underlies this forest and exerts some influence on the
flora, but some acidification has probably occurred through vertical leaching.
<p> The flood plain of the Dry Fork was largely open at
this point and consisted of cobble bars. Where these have been swept away in
the vicinity of the channel, there is regularly-jointed gray-blue massive
limestone. Trees were mostly Sycamore and Allegheny Blackberry (<i>Rubus 
allegheniensis</i>) formed dense thickets at the edge. Tall herbs
dominated, and included Grass-leaved Goldenrod (<i>Euthamia graminifolia</i>) ,
Big Bluestem (<i>Andropogon gerardi</i>
) and Many-flowered Panic Grass (<i>Panicum polyanthes</i>) among others. The presence
of Big Bluestem indicates circumneutral or alkaline soils on the flood plain.
<p> After crossing the Dry Fork on a high footbridge, our
8-9-99 inventory was continued along the edge of Otter Creek, while that of
8-10-99 extended along a parallel trail higher up the Valley slope. The aspect
here is almost due north. Rocks in both the stream bed and on the slope are dominated
by limestone. In the vicinity of the Dry Fork the canopy consisted of abundant
Sugar Maple, some Northern Red Oak up to 25 inches ( O.64 m ) dbh, Shagbark
Hickory, Adelgid-free Canada Hemlock, Cucumbertree, Black Locust and saplings
of Beech. Understory trees were Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya virginiana</i>) and
Striped Maple, while Great Rhododendron and Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis</i> <i>virginiana</i>) were common shrubs. It is
of interest that here as at other areas with carbonate rocks (see <a href=dismalcreekdoo.htm>our section
on Virginia's Dismal Creek area</a>), acidiphile species such as Beech and Great
Rhododendron are perched on top of limestone ledges but do not grow on the
slope immediately below or from the cliffs themselves.
<p> The following species were successively noted along
the Creek-side trail: Thin-leaved Sunflower (<i>Helianthus decapetalus</i>) in
bloom, Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i>) , White Wood Aster (<i>A. 
divaricatus</i>) , Crooked-stem Aster (<i>A. prenanthoides</i>) ,
Broad-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago flexicaulis</i>) , Black Locust and Indian
Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana</i>) under Hemlock.
<p> Then arriving at the base of a cliff of massive
limestone and progressing along the trail from there we saw Yellow Birch, Downy
Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum pubescens</i>) , the moss <i>Aulocomnium 
heterostichum</i>, the calciphile Bulbiferous Bladder Fern (<i>Cystopteris 
bulbifera</i>) , Palmate-leaf Violet (<i>Viola palmata</i>) ,Goatsbeard
(<i>Aruncus dioicus</i>) , American Spikenard (<i>Aralia racemosa</i>) , a
sapling of Slippery Elm (<i>Ulmus rubra</i>) , Thimbleweed (<i>Anemone 
virginiana</i>) , Summer Grape (<i>Vitis aestivalis</i>) , Tasslerue (<i>Trautvetteria caroliniensis</i>) , the sedge <i>Carex plantaginea </i>in close association with Bulbiferous Bladder Fern, Wild
Stonecrop (<i>Sedum ternatum</i>) , Wild Ginger (<i>Asarum 
canadense</i>) , a gall of the earth (<i>Prenanthes </i> sp ), Spice
Bush, an unidentified <i>Carex,</i> Maidenhair Fern (<i>Adiantum pedatum</i>) ,
Dutchman's Pipe vine (<i>Aristolochia macrophylla</i>) , the calciphile sedge <i>Carex</i> 
<i>albursina,</i> the fungus <i>Tremella 
mesenterica </i>on wood,
Columbine (<i>Aqilegia canadensis</i>
) and Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>) .
<p> Moving farther upstream, there was very abundant <i>Carex 
plantaginea</i>, Filmy Angelica (<i>Angelica triquinata</i>) , the rich-soil mint <i>Meehania 
cordata</i>, abundant Bulbiferous Bladder Fern, Silvery Glade Fern (<i>Athyrium</i> <i>thelypterioides</i>) , Wood
Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>) , Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga 
racemosa</i>) , Broad-leaf Goldenrod in abundance; then, in a seep,
Golden Saxifrage (<i>Chrysosplenium americanum</i>) and Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>) , followed by Mountain
Maple (<i>Acer spicatum</i>) and Foam Flower (<i>Tiarella cordifolia</i>) .We had now arrived at a
small waterfall.
<p> On our 8-10-99 traverse, with the initial section
upslope from the Creek-side trail, we noted in succession Selfheal (<i>Prunella 
vulgaris</i>) , Autumn Bent grass (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>) , Beech saplings in soil
immediately above limestone ledges, abundant Sugar Maple, Northern Red Oak,
Downy Many Knees, clumps of what appeared to be the sedge <i>Carex digitalis</i>, Great
Rhododendron, also growing in soil on limestone ledges, Bulbiferous Bladder
Fern growing from fissures in limestone; then, on the slope below the limestone
ledges: abundant <i>Carex plantaginea</i> , Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata</i>) , Flowering Raspberry (<i>Rubus 
odoratus</i>) , abundant Wild Ginger and American Spikenard coming into
bloom. Here, under the imposing limestone cliffs previously described, the
trail merged with that along the Creek-side.
<p> On this day a diversion was made to the Creek where
we saw a luxuriant and diverse community of vascular plants and bryophytes.
Included were the aquatic moss <i>Fontinalis filiformis</i> in the stream,the river sedge <i>Carex
torta</i>, an <i>Atrichum</i> moss, likely <i>A. undulatum</i>, accompanied
by the thallus liverwort <i>Conocephalum conicum</i> and other bryophites ( see list
that follows ) on wet rocks. and Lettuce Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga micranthidifolia</i>) 
in the shallows. On a slight bank elevation grew small Beech, as did Great
Rhododendron on a decaying two foot ( 0.61 m ) diameter down bole - all with
Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio aureus</i>) , Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea 
arborescens</i>) , Mountain Maple and brilliantly-blooming Oswego Tea (<i>Monarda 
didyma</i>) in the immediate vicinity.
<p> After passing the previously mentioned waterfall, we
arrived at a bench or terrace which in the past may have been cultivated, but
which was now being reclaimed by forest. Here also there was a virtual end to
large exposures of limestone and, except for very restricted patches, the
calciphile plants associated with them. Initially this terrace was somewhat
acidic, with Muscletree (<i>Carpinnus caroliniensis</i>) , a little Shining
Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium lucidulum</i>) and Golden Ragwort with
bordering Black Locust. We then entered an area of the terrace, seemingly less
acidic, with Ox-eye (<i>Heliopsis helianthoides</i>) , Black Raspberry (<i>Rubus 
occidentalis</i>) , Black Birch, Tuliptree and Variable Panic Grass (<i>Panicum 
commutatum</i>) . This community soon gave way to an opening or
semi-opening of the terrace bordered by Black Locust and a large , vigorous
vine of Summer Grape. The opening itself was dominated by tall herbs such as
Virginia Knotweed, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa</i>) and Poke Milkweed (<i>Asclepias 
exaltata</i>) and by 15 foot ( 4.6 m ) long canes of Allegheny
Blackberry with ripe fruit. A sngle large White Pine also bordered the opening,
<p> A diversion was made to the opening's edge at the
base of the rocky bordering slope. Here were both Virginia and Broad-leaved
Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum</i> and <i>H. canadense</i>) , Black Cohosh, and the
calciphile Walking Fern (<i>Camptosorus rhizophyllus</i>) , with the latter on a
block of limestone talus . Also noted in the vicinity were the grass<i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i> and the
aliens Asiatic Water Pepper (<i>Polgonum cespitosum</i>) and Ground Ivy (<i>Glechoma 
hederacea</i>) .
<p> Continuing across the terrace, which was of the order
of 100 feet ( 30 m ) in width, we once more entered a more acidic area with mature
Red Maple , large patches of Ground Pine (<i>
Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>) ,
scattered clumps of the sedges <i>Carex virescens</i> and <i>C. gracillima,</i> both of which were maturing,
New York Fern and seedlings of Red Maple . More limited areas appeared less
acid, with <i>Meehania cordata</i>,<i>Carex laxiflora</i> and Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>) . However
these areas soon gave way to edging slopes with Great Rhododendron, Round -leaf
Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia</i>) , New York Fern, the first Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>) , a little stunted Bracken Fern (<i>Pteridium 
aquilinum</i>) , <i>Carex debilis</i>, the first Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum 
canadense</i>) , Pink Ladyslipper (<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>) , abundant Ground Pine,
seedlings of Downy Service Berry (<i>Amelanchier</i> <i>arborea
</i>) and a 20 inch ( 0.5 m ) dbh Yellow Birch.
<p> As we continued our passage over sandstone cobbles
and sandy alluvium, we encountered more
Red Maple, abundant Yellow Birch , a small patch of Downy Rattlesnake Plantain
(<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>) and, on a talus fragment, the striking and
easily-identified moss <i>Rhodobryum roseum</i>. These were followed by another
apparent change in soil chemistry, as indicated by seedlings of Sugar Maple and
Bitternut Hickory, Witch Hazel, American Dog Violet (<i>Viola conspersa</i>) , Mountain
Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia compressa</i>) , Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella 
repens</i>) and the fungi<i>
Tricholomopsis plataphylla</i> and the deadly <i>Amanita 
bisporigera </i>.
<p> We now arrived at the Otter Creek Wilderness
boundary, and, although the trail followed the Creek closely, conditions continued
prevailingly acid. As indicated by the
flora, minor, apparently more alkaline patches attracted our attention by the
presence of such species as Broad-leaved and Virginia Waterleaf . However large
blocks of conglomeratic sandstone ( likely
Pottsville ) in the vicinity bore Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium virginianum</i>) ,
while in close proximity there was Miterwort (<i>Mitella diphylla</i>) , White
Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis montana</i>) and abundant mosses. Wood
Betony (<i>Pedicularis canadensis</i>) was present along the
trail.
<p> The prevalence of acidic soil here appeared to favor
a greater abundance and diversity of fungi than the less acidic
&quot;richer&quot; soils of the limestone terrain. As we entered the Wilderness
area we initially identified the edible
<i>Tylopilus</i> <i>chromapes</i> as well as<i>
Collybia confluens </i>and large &quot;fairy rings&quot; of <i>Collybia</i> <i>dryophylla</i> under a canopy dominated by Tuliptree and a 20 inch ( 0.5 m ) dbh
Black Birch. Also seen was a single plant of what appeared to be Wild Lily of
the Valley (<i>Convallaria montana</i>) , Tree Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium 
obscurum</i>) and a single bush of Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia 
latifolia</i>) . Additional fungi in the vicinity were <i>Amanita 
flavoconia</i>,<i>Cordiceps militaris,</i> the edible puffball <i>Lycoperdon 
perlatum</i> and , in
particular, very abundant <i>Boletus bicolor</i>, which was to provide us an evening meal.
<p> The stream-side, here dominated by siliceous cobbles
and boulders, bore little of the rich flora of bryophites and moisture-loving
plants seen on the limestone dominated bed . However, Tasslerue was common, and
there was a little Silky Willow (<i>Salix sericea</i>) as well.
<p> On the trail once more, we were impressed by the tall
and well-formed Tuliptree, Black and Yellow Birches, Basswood, Sugar Maple and
White Ash of the area we now entered. Also encountered was a pair of Juncos (<i>Junco hyemalis</i>) that were
behaving territorially although the nesting season had presumably ended a month
or more ago . These birds kept teasing
our dog, encouraging him to chase them vigorously back and forth among shrubs
and low branches. Since this bird is reputed to breed only above 700 meters in
these mountains ( Buckelew and Hall, 1994 ), the presence of a territory here at near 1850 feet ( 565 m ) asl is of
some interest . Also heard by us here was a Pileated Woodpecker (<i>Dryocopus 
pileatus</i>) ..
<p> We now again traversed an area of less than usual acidic
character, with <i>Meehania cordata</i>, <i>Carex plantaginea</i>, Mealy
Bellwort (<i>Uvularia perfoliata</i>) , Wood Anemone (<i>Anemone 
quinquefolia</i>) and, in a seep, <i>Carex scabrata</i>. Fungi noted were <i>Amanita 
rubescens</i> and, on a decaying
Shagbark, <i>Ganoderma</i> <i>applanatum</i>,
<i>Polyporus squamosus</i> and <i>P. 
varius</i>.
<p> We were next attracted by a conspicuous rock near the
trail that is best described as &quot;rotten sandstone&quot;, perhaps a
sandstone with carbonate cementing silica sand grains. Cosistent with this
surmise was the presence of the calciphile Walking Fern in a thick mantle of
moss that appeared to be mainly <i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>.
<p> At this point we ended our 8-9-99 traverse, but
continued onward on 8-10-99. Passing through terrain of indefinite chemical
character, we saw Broad-leaved Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium purpureum</i>) and
Yellow Birch ascending the bordering slope; then arrived at a seep with Common
Horsetail (<i>Equisetum arvense</i>) ,<i>Scirpus pollyphyllus</i> and <i>Carex scabrata.</i> These were followed by Red
Maple, abundant Yellow Birch, Sycamore, the manna grass <i>Glyceria melicaria</i>,
Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus</i>) , a vine of Summer Grape and
the only Honewort (<i>Cryptotaenia canadensis</i>) seen on either traverse.
<p> Directing our attention to the nearby Creek we noted
Beech, Sugar Maple and Hemlock on the bank, Tasslerue among the stream bed
cobble and on the opposite shore, a single Dotted Thorn (<i>Crataegus punctata</i>) .
<p> Again moving along the trail, we arrived at another
section of terrace, which initially at least, bore a rich mesic flora. No Great
Rhododendron was present, even on the adjacent slope. Instead the undergrowth
was dominated by large Spice Bush and Witch Hazel under a canopy of Sugar
Maple, Black Locust, Tuliptree and American Basswood. Other woody species were
Muscletree and Thornless Blackberry (<i>Rubus canadensis</i>) , the latter with ripe
fruit. Abundant Virginia Knotweed,<i>
Meehania cordata</i> and Intermediate Shield Fern formed a ground
cover, while a species of <i>Atrichum</i>
was conspicuous among the mosses .
<p> This flora soon gave way to one with Great
Rhododendron once more prominent on the adjacent slope, while along the trail
grew Creeping Phlox (<i>Phlox stolonifera</i>) , <i>Medeola</i> , Hay-scented Fern
and Black Cohosh. The fungus <i>Boletus piperatus</i> was common under Hemlock and Great Rhododendron. These were
followed by abundant Ground Pine, New York Fern, small Beech and a single small
Fraser Magnolia (<i>Magnolia fraseri</i>) amidst towering Tuliptrees.
<p> Increasing the pace of our traverse, we moved through
acidic terrain with abundant Great Rhododendron, with a ground cover that
included Shining as well as Tree Clubmoss and the fungi<i>Amanita ceciliae</i> and the edible <i>Boletus auripes</i>, both under
Great Rhododendron. Following these there were numerous small Hemlock under the
deciduous canopy, then very abundant Hay-scented, New York and Intermediate
Shield Ferns. Of interest was the small amount of deer browsing exhibited by
Hemlock seedlings and saplings . This environment seemed to favor<i>Boletus 
bicolor</i>, which, according to R. Hunsucker, provided the best
collecting of this mushroom ever experienced by him.
<p> While the diversity and density of the ground cover
was relatively low along this section of trail, we tallied Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola 
blanda</i>) , Wake Robin (<i>Trillium erectum</i>) , Painted Trillium (<i>T. 
undulatum</i>) , tiny Hemlock seedlings sprouting from <i>Dicranum</i> moss and fungi that included the Sweet Tooth (<i>Hydnum 
repandum</i>) , <i>Psathyrella delineata </i>and a species of<i>Leccinum</i> .
<p> Seen as we approached the end of our traverse were many small Hemlock and a small Shagbark
Hickory under large birch and Tuliptree, a down bole covered by <i>Hypnum</i> moss, the only Hobblebush (<i>Viburnum</i> <i>alnifolium</i>) seen on
the trip, an Ash Bolete (<i>Gyrodon merulioides</i>) under a White Ash and a
swiftly scampering and noisy Red Squirrel (<i>Tamiasciurius
 hudsonicus</i>) . The total length of our 8-10-99 traverse was somewhat over a mile (1.6 km).

<p><b> A word About the Camp Area</b>
<ul>
<p> The camp area appeared to be underlain by a reddish
subsoil, likely a residuum of weathered limestone. High cut banks bore plants
such as Water Hemlock (<i>Cicuta maculata</i>) and Common Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium 
fistulosum</i>) , species more characteristic of wetlands but also
indicative of nutrient-rich soils. Their presence here likely resulted from persistant
seeps from the limestone bedrock.
<p> Catbirds (<i>Dumetella carolinensis</i>) were omnipresent during
the daylight hours. On the morning 8-10-99 numerous birds , including
White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>Sitta carolinensis</i>) , unidentified woodpeckers
and warblers wee very active in the trees and shrubery. Blue Jays (<i>Cyanocitta 
cristata</i>) , Red-eyed Vireos (<i>Vireo
 olivaceus</i>) and possible Veeries (<i>Catharus fuscescens</i>) were also observed. Dring
the late evenings and into the night katydids with calls unlike my Shenandoah
Valley reference called, as did Screech Owls (<i>Otus osio</i>) and tiny
mosquitoes ( perhaps as a consequence of the drought ) were active in late
evening but not at night.

<p><b>Summary</b>
<ul>
<p> The lower Otter Creek Valley well-reflects the moist
acid-mesic regime in the region of the Allegheny cloudy day maximum ( Reifsnyder
and Lull, 1965 ). This narrow valley with abundant cool flowing water is also
subject to cooling by subsiding air from the highlands. The effect of this
cooling is shown by the presence of such species as Canada Mayflower, White
Wood Sorrel, Mountain Maple, Thornless Blackberry and Hobblebush, all of which
are seldom found at 1800 feet asl except in such valleys.
<p> The patchiness of the terrain with respect to soil
chemistry ,as indicated by the flora, is to be expected given the presence of
such widely divergent rock types as limestone and sandstone. Although limestone
probably underlies most of the terrain inventoried by us, sandstone appears to
greatly dominate the alluvium. Thus acidiphile communities occur most widely,
but calciphiles are found where this alluvium is thin or absent or where
colluvial waters from the limestone find their way to the surface. Nuances, as
the observed disposition of acidiphiles such as Great Rhododendron and
calciphiles such as Bulbiferous Bladder Fern with respect to limestone ledges
further support the general impression of a close correspondence between the
flora and substrate throughout the area inventoried.
