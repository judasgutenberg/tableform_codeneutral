</B><P>&#9;Our ascent of Pearis Mountain was along the Appalachian Trail, starting at the edge of the City of Pearisburg. This ascent was up the front of the mountain promontory that faces the New River Lowland. The ascent, which began at an elevation near 1700 feet(519 meters) asl, was up slopes with dominantly north/northeast aspects and over limestone terrain, although sandstone and other rocks were observed in the upper part of the traverse. Terrain features and species observed will be listed in the general order in which they were noted on the traverse. As is conventional in this work, both common and scientific names will be given on first mention, but only common names thereafter- with a few exceptions.</P>
<P>&#9;The initial ascent was steep and over outcroppings of a light gray and slightly bluish, thick-bedded and homogenious limestone. It is likely that this is the Middle Ordovician high-calcium limestone in the upper part of the carbonate sequence mapped here (Rader and Gathright,1986).If so ,this is the much-quarried rock of the area. The forest here is young and in many places consisted only of large saplings. But the slope is well-watered and this combined with the limy soil, supports an exceedingly rich and diverse growth of both woody and herbacious plants, and from our observations, provides excellent habitat for many birds as well.</P>
<P>&#9;Canopy species initially included an abundance of Hackberry<I>( Celtus occidentalis </I>) and Black Maple(<I>Acer nigrum </I>), but Slippery Elm (<I>Ulmus rubra ) , </I>Ash-leaved Maple (<I>Acer negundo </I>), Black Cherry (<I>Prunus serotina </I>) and, most interestingly, Honey Locust (<I>Gleditsia triacanthos </I>) was also common. Redbud (<I>Cercis canadensis</I> ) was here the most abundant understory tree, while Blackhaw Viburnum (<I>Viburnum prunifolium </I>), Bladdernut (<I>Staphlea trifolia </I>) and Black Raspberry (<I>Rubus occidentalis </I>) comprised the shrub layer. Among the prolific vines Virginia Creeper ( <I>Parthenocissus</I> <I>quinquefolia </I>),Poison Ivy (<I>Rhus radicans </I>), Hispid Greenbrier (<I>Smilax hispida )</I>, Common Greenbrier (<I>S. rotundifolia </I>) And Winter Grape (<I>Vitis vulpina </I>) stood out.</P>
<P>&#9;Initially, at the forest edge, there was a great curtain of the alien Chinese Yam (<I>Dioscorea batatas </I>), but in the forest herbs were dominated by dense patches of the tall native White-flowered Leafcup<I>(Polymnia canadensis </I>) then in bloom,and a number of other characteristically calciphile species. Other conspicuous herbs were Wild Stonecrop (<I>Sedum ternatum </I>) White Snakeroot (<I>Eupatorium rugosum </I>) and Virginia Knotweed (<I>Polygonum virginianum </I>). Incessant calls of Scarlet Tanagers (<I>Piranga olivaceae </I>) and other birds accompanied our passage through the forest.</P>
<P>&#9;Continuing upward, we saw the calciphiles Bulbiferous Bladder Fern (<I>Cystopteris bulbifera </I>) and Chinquapin Oak (<I>Quercus muehlenbergii </I>), followed by Bloodroot (<I>Sanguinaria canadensis </I>), a species of Sanicle<I>(Sanicula </I>sp), Ebony Spleenwort (<I>Esplenium platyneuron </I>) and Canada Moonseed (<I>Menispermum canadense</I> ); then these by Alternate-leaved Dogwood <I>(Cornus alternifolia </I>), Black Walnut (<I>Juglans nigra </I>), Red Mulberry (<I>Morus rubra</I> ), more Black Maple, Mayapple (<I>Podophyllum peltatum </I>),a Gooseberry (<I>Ribes </I>sp), abundant Honewort (<I>Cryptotaenia canadensis </I>) Flowering Dogwood (<I>Cornus florida </I>),Daisy Fleabane <I>(Erigeron annuus</I> ) and our first Yellow Buckeye (<I>Aesculus octandra </I>), but with the last-named virtually confined to seedlings.</P>
<P>&#9;Climbing through still young forest, we saw in sequence Bottlebrush Grass (<I>Hystrix patula </I>) Hackberry in abundance, White Ash (<I>Fraxinus americana </I>) and Bitternut Hickory (<I>Carya cordiformis </I>), here as in many limestone soil areas, the most common hickory. Following were Shagbark Hickory (<I>Carya ovata </I>), Broad-leaf Goldenrod <I>(Solidago flexicaulis </I>) and Hairy Sweet Cicely (<I>Osmorhiza</I> <I>claytoni </I>), here identified by, in addition to its characteristic hairiness, style length. This species was the only member of its genus seen on our traverse.</P>
<P>&#9;Not far above this level, likely on more siliceous bedrock and more acidic soils, we saw our first Sugar Maple (<I>Acer saccharum )</I> and more significantly, scattered Red Maple (<I>Acer rubrum </I>) as well. These were followed by Blue Wood Aster (<I>Aster cordifolius </I>) and the calls of Red-eyed Vireos <I>(Vireo olivaceus </I>). Here we began to encounter, or perhaps merely notice, a small (one cm or less) land snail with a steeply spiralled and subtely yellow shell held almost parallel to the substrate surface.</P>
<P>&#9;Next seen was Dutchmans Pipe Vine (<I>Aristolochia macrophylla </I>) on a small tree, then our first Black Oak <I>(Quercus velutina</I> ),a common oak of dry limestone as well as acidic terrain, Plume Lily (<I>Smilacina racemosa</I> ), more Hispid Greenbrier, then the first White Oak (<I>Quercus alba </I>), more Sugar Maple, abundant Blackhaw Viburnum, White Wood Aster (<I>Aster divaricatus)</I> , followed by considerable White Ash.</P>
<P>&#9;Now at perhaps 200 feet (61 meters) in elevation above our starting point,we saw Canada Brome Grass (<I>Bromus purgans </I>), Christmas Fern (<I>Polystichum acrostichoides </I>), Four-leaved Yam (<I>Dioscorea quaternata </I>), Hairy Panic Grass (<I>Panicum lanuginosum </I>), Wild Liquorice <I>(Galium circaezans</I> ), Hophornbeam (<I>Ostrya virginiana</I> ), a hairy-leaved sedge (possibly <I>Carex hirtifolia </I>), a meadowrue (<I>Thalictrum</I> sp), Japanese Honeysuckle (<I>Lonicera japonica </I>), the forest grass<I> Brachyelytrum erectum</I>, Rattlesnake Fern <I>(Botrychium virginianum </I>) and Wild Sage (<I>Salvia lyrata </I>), here on or very close to limestone outcroppings. </P>
<P>&#9;At this level we reached a landmark in the form of a road at perhaps 2000 feet ( 610 meters ) asl and the only one between this level and the summit. Immediately above the road there was again much White-flowered Leafcup, then Dotted St Johns-wort ( <I>Hypericum punctatum</I> ) and Sharp-lobe Hepatica (<I> Hepatica acutiloba </I>), a frequent species on limestone but not entirely so restricted.</P>
<P>&#9;Not far above the road we encountered a markedly different rock, which by acid test, proved to be carbonate-bearing, but with a fissile structure. It may have been the argilacious limestone that is said to mark the top of the sequence ( Rader and Gathright,1986 ). A spot inventory here yielded Sugar Maple, American Basswood (<I> Tilia</I> <I>americana</I> ) and unexpectedly, a 9 inch ( 23 cm ) dbh Red Maple only six feet (2 meters ) from and stratigraphically above the fissile carbonate rock.</P>
<P>&#9;Not far above this we tallied our first Witch Hazel ( <I>Hamemelis virginiana </I>), more White-flowered Leafcup, then Mealy Bellwort ( <I>Uvularia perfoliata</I> ), followed by Northern Red Oak ( <I>Quercus rubra </I>), more small Yellow Buckeye and then, at the trail edge,a showy Canada Lily (<I> Lilium canadense </I>) in full bloom. A little beyond we saw the first Muscletree ( <I>Carpinus caroliniana </I>) , then Wood Nettle ( <I>Laportea canadensis</I> ), Spice Bush ( <I>Lindera benzoin</I> ), the forest sedge<I>Carex platyphylla</I>, Black Cohosh (<I> Cimicifuga racemosa</I> ), Wild Geranium ( <I>Geranium maculatum </I>) and Pasture Rose ( <I>Rosa carolina </I>).</P>
<P>&#9;Next seen was an alum root ( probably <I>Heuchera americana </I>), followed by Nodding Fescue ( <I>Festuca obtusa</I> ),Shagbark Hickory, Sugar Maple, Yellow Buckeye, White Oak, a small Beech ( <I>Fagus grandifolia</I> ), Muscletree, and at trails edge, the alien Garlic Mustard ( <I>Alliaria officinalis </I>)-all of which are listed to convey the general aspect of the forest.</P>
<P>&#9;At this point the trail is crossed by a telephone line at a possible attained elevation of about 2200 feet ( 670 meters ) asl. Here also we noted the first Tuliptree ( <I>Liriodendron tulipifera</I> ), although it is no doubt present at lower elevations. This was followed by Broad-leaf Waterleaf ( <I>Hydrophyllum canadense </I>) and not far beyond by Virginia Waterleaf ( <I>Hydrophyllum virginianum </I>), and seemingly out of place, a little Intermediate Shield Fern ( <I>Dryopteris intermedia</I> ). Perhaps significantly, the only visible rock in the vicinity was sandstone.</P>
<P>&#9;We now reached a steepened slope and a turn of the trail toward the east on the approach to a sloping bench that was occupied by dry, acidic forest with a canopy of Chestnut Oak ( <I>Quercus prinus </I>), Northern Red Oak, Red Maple, Black Birch (<I>Betula lenta) </I>,Sassafras ( <I>Sassafras albidum </I>), Tuliptree and Beech. Understory here consisted of Serviceberry ( probably <I>Amelanchier arborea </I>), while Maple-leaf Viburnum (<I>Viburnum acerifolium </I>), Witch Hazel, Deer Berry ( <I>Vaccinium stamineum</I> ), Upland Low Blueberry (<I> V. pallidum</I> ) and Flame Azalea (<I>Rhododendron calendulaceum </I>) formed shrub layers. A luxuriant growth of Mountain Oat Grass ( <I>Danthonia compressa</I> ) was conspicuous in this rather open forest where it was accompanied by Indian Cucumberroot (<I> Medeola virginiana </I>), Mountain Bellwort (<I> Uvularia pudica </I>) and brightly crimson Fire Pink (<I>Silene virginica )</I> among scattered large blocks of sandstone. </P>
<P>&#9;Above the bench, where the slope again steepens, conditions again become more mesic with Black Elderberry (<I> Sambucus canadensis </I>), Wild Hydrangea (<I> Hydrangea arborescens</I> ) and abundant Sugar Maple. Here near the trail there is a derilict steel communications tower set in a beautiful mature forest, although apparently not as rich in species and growth as that of the lower slopes. A spot inventory here yielded Sugar Maple, American Basswood, Cucumbertree (<I>Magnolia</I> <I>acuminata </I>), Bitternut Hickory, Black Cherry, abundant Wood Nettle, Blue Cohosh (<I> Caulophylum thalictroides </I>), Broad-leaved Waterleaf, Wild Ginger (<I> Asarum canadense </I>) and Pallid Jewelweed (<I> Impatiens</I> <I>pallida</I> ). A conspicuous outcrop of red sandstone occurs here at the terminus of our traverse at perhaps 2800 feet ( 824 meters ) asl.</P>
<P>&#9;The age of the forest in the vicinity of the trail varies greatly and although there are many young tracts, particularily at the lowest elevations, there are few really old trees. As indicated, the most mature trees appear to be found near the end of the traverse. As a whole, perhaps half of those seen would be classed as mature and most of these were on upper slopes. Black Cherry here also has the poor form characteristic of the Valley and Ridge.</P>
<P>&#9;The dry, acidic bench that interrupts the generally circumneutral to alkaline mesic forest instructs us once again not only on the influence of bedrock, which here is sandstone, but also on the role of diminished slope in substituting a static vertical leaching regime for the colluvial dynamism that generates the most fertile soils by motion of nutrients and moisture down-slope.</P>
<P>&#9;Our traverse extended approximately one half the vertical distance to the summit ridge of Pearis Mountain. Based on the resistant Silurian sandstones of the Tuscarora Formation that form this ridge, a dry, acidic oak forest is to be expected at those elevations; but this can be verified only by direct survey. If the lower slope limestones,that yield the most productive soils,retain their topographic position in the region, as the geologic map indicates, the potential for a considerable zone of these forests exists on a number of ridges. Protection of remnants of this forest and future restoration of the zone would be a worthy sequel to these inventories.</P>
