<h1>Pedlar River Watershed</h1>
<p><b>Amherst County, Virginia</b><br>
<i>April 2000</i>
<ul>
<p>


</ul>
<p><b>General</b>
<ul> 
<p> The Pedlar River, a tributary of the lower James,
lies between the westernmost ridge and a complex of some of the highest peaks
of the northern Blue Ridge. Elevations range from 699 feet  (213 m)  asl at the
James River to 4000 feet  (1200 m)  on Cole Mountain.
<p> The Pedlar, if we discount its many bends, flows
almost directly south and thus cuts obliquely across the prevailing strike of
the ancient Pre - Cambrian Blue Ridge lithology. Consequently it is underlain
by a great variety of rocks and structures,which include such deep-seated rock
types as granulites, charnockites, mylonites and a variety of other gneisses
and schists, as well as only slightly modified Cambrian sediments  (Rader and
Evans, 1993) . Of particular interest to our present studies are the massive,
coarse-grained leucocratic charnockites of granitic composition. Since these
rocks form the highest elevations, they are the source of many sediments in the
upper Watershed. Also of interest are the darker and finer-grained pyroxene
granulites that contrast starkly with the leucocratic charnockites and which
come from different parts of the Watershed.
<p> Inventories were conducted in three areas. These were
1) the flood plain of the Pedlar River at the junction with Davis Mill Creek at
Oronoco, 2) the immediate vicinity of Statons Creek Falls on Statons Creek and
3) the northeast slope of Cole Mountain along the Appalachian Trail at the very
edge of the Watershed.
<p> We follow our usual convention here in listing both
scientific and common names of species on first mention, but only common names
thereafter, with a few exceptions for species with obscure or no common names. Thus the first encounter with a
species can be at once apparent .
<p>&nbsp;
</ul>
<p><b>Pedlar Flood Plain at Oronoco</b>

<p><b>Source Walks: 6-22-98, 10-5-98 and 10-6-98.</b>
<ul>
<p>Our inventories here were all conducted in the
vicinity of the national forest campground and at the confluence of the Pedlar
River and Davis Mill Creek. Elevations are near 1620 feet  (494 m) asl and the
terrain is mostly quite flat, although there are levee-type ridges.The 6-22-98
visit to the campground, in quite warm weather, was brief but notable for the
identification of Turk's Lily (<i>Lilium superbum</i>)  and the relatively large numbers of Scarlet Tanagers (<i>Piranga 
olivacea</i>) heard and / or seen not only at the campground, but
throughout this part of the Blue Ridge.
<p> The canopy in the immediate vicinity of the
campground appeared to be dominated by Sycamore and White Pine, with common
Northern Red and White Oaks, Tuliptree, Black walnut, Somewhat Adelgid-infested
Canada Hemlock, White Ash, Shagbark Hickory, Cucumbertree (<i>Magnolia 
acuminata</i>),  American and
Slippery Elms, American and White Basswoods, Red Maple, Ash-leaf Maple (<i>Acer 
negundo</i>),  Black Gum, Sassafras, Black Cherry, Virginia and Pitch
Pines. A single Black Birch and a 16 inch  (0.4 m) Butternut were also seen.
Black Cherry had the usual poor form characteristic of the region, but on our
October visit bore a heavy crop of fruit. The fair-sized Arborvitae (<i>Thuja 
occidentalis</i>) that apparently occurs only at the campground,was in
all probability planted.
<p> Understory species noted in the vicinity of the
campground were common, apparently healthy flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus 
florida</i>) and Muscletree (<i>
Carpinus caroliniana</i>) . Shrubs were
dominated by Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>),  with subordinate American
Hazelnut (<i>Corylus americana</i>),  Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea 
arborescens</i>),  Black Haw Viburnum (<i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>) and
Winterberry Holly (<i>Ilex verticillata</i>) . Coral Berry (<i>Symphoricarpos orbiculatus</i>) was also common. No ericaceae were seen.
<p> Vines included Winter Grape (<i>Vitis vulpina</i>),  Poison
Ivy (<i>Rhus</i> <i>radicans</i>),  Virginia
Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</i>),  Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax 
rotundifolia</i>) and Japanese Honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera japonica</i>) . In one place the alien
English Ivy  (<i>Hedera helix</i>) was rampant
on and under White Pine.
<p> Herbs seen in the vicinity of the campground were
Honewort (<i>Cryptotaenia canadensis</i>),  Smooth and Hairy Sweet
Cicely (<i>Osmunda longistylis</i>
and <i>O. claytoni</i>),  Virginia knotweed (<i>Polygonum 
virginianum</i>),  Wingstem (<i>
Verbesina alternifolia</i>),  Tall
Coneflower (<i>Rudbeckia laciniata</i>),  Panicled Aster (<i>Aster 
simplex</i>),  Crooked-stem Aster (<i>A. prenanthoides</i>),  Lowries Aster (<i>A. 
lowrieanus</i>),  Calico Aster (<i>A. lateriflorus</i>),  Velvety Tick-trefoil (<i>Desmodium 
viridiflorum</i>),  tall and particularly vigorous Common Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum 
biflorum</i>) and Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema
 triphyllum</i>
). Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum
acrostichoides</i>) was common on local elevations and Wood Reed Grass (<i>Cinna 
arundinacea</i>) was seen on the bank of Davis Mill Creek.
<p> Determinations were made of the pH of the water of
Davis Mill Creek and the Pedlar River, which in each case was found to be 5.3.
A determination of the rich surface alluvium along Davis Mill Creek yielded pH=
5.2. It was of some interest that rocks in the bed of the latter stream
appeared to be mostly a dense, fine-grained, greenish feldspathic variety and
could have been an arkosic granulite.
<p> On the cloudy late afternoon of 10-6-98 a loop
traverse was made upstream from the campground along the Pedlar River. We first
crossed the River at the road bridge, proceeding upstream along the west side
of the flood plain, then recrossed the River and made our return across the
flood plain along the River's east side.
<p> As we began our traverse Spring Peepers (<i>Hyla 
crucifer</i>) called along Davis Mill Creek in defiance of the season.
Canopy species along the traverse were generally as previously described.
However seedlings of Northern Red and Black Oaks were seen at the edge of the
upland forest where we also saw Mockernut Hickory (<i>Carya tomentosa</i>) and
Fringe Tree (<i>Chionanthus virginica
</i>). Shrubs noted on the flood plain near the River were Smooth Alder (<i>Alnus 
serrulata</i>),  abundant Spice Bush, Black Raspberry (<i>Rubus occidentalis</i>),  American
Hazelnut and Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis
virginiana</i>) . Vines seen were Common Greenbrier, Winter Grape and Summer
Grape (<i>Vitis aestivalis</i>
).
<p> The following species were successively identified on
our traverse along the west ide of the flood plain: American Selfheal (<i>Prunella 
vulgaris </i> var <i>lanceolata</i>
), Asiatic Water pepper (<i>Polygonum cespitosum</i>),  Riparian Wild Rye (<i>Elymus 
riparius</i>),  Groundnut (<i>Apios americana</i>),  Thin-leaved Sunflower (<i>Helianthus 
decapetalus</i>),  Great Blue Lobelia (<i>Lobelia siphilitica</i>),  Tall
Agrimony (<i>Agrimonia gryposepala</i>),  Three-seeded Mercury (<i>Acalypha 
rhomboidea</i>),  Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa</i>), 
Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>), 
Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus</i>),  an avens (<i>Geum</i> 
sp),  Sensitive Fern (<i>
Onoclea sensibilis</i>),  White Vervain
(<i>Verbena urticifolia</i>),  Deer-tongue Grass (<i>Panicum clandestinum</i>), 
Black Cohosh  (Cimicifuga racemosa),  a
skullcap  (Scutellaria sp),  Ebony
Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium platyneuron</i>) on elevations, Blue Wood
Aster (<i>Aster</i> <i>cordifolius
</i>), Wavy-leaf Aster (<i>A. undulatus</i>),  the liverwort <i>Nowellia curvifolia </i>on on a large
rotting down bole, Woodland Sunflower (<i>Helianthus</i> <i>divaricatus
</i>) and Slender-flowered Muhly grass (<i>Muhlenbergia tenuiflora</i>),  with the last two species
occurring on the lower slope with Summer Grape.
<p> After traversing along the edge of the flood plain
for perhaps i/4 mile  (0.4 km) upstream, we turned toward the River. A striking
feature of the River bed here, under the existing conditions of low water, was
the abundance in the bedload of uniformly-sized,four inch  (10 cm), 
well-rounded cobbles of coarse-grained leucocratic gneiss. This was in contrast
to the dark, fine-grained material that comprised the bedload of Davis Mill
Creek. Also seen here were numerous 3 inch  (7.6 cm)  long fish of an
unidentified kind. Plants encountered either in the stream bed or on the
adjacent bank were Water Hemlock (<i>Cicuta maculata</i>),  Wild Lettuce (<i>Lactuca 
canadensis</i>), the tall sedge <i>Carex 
gynandra</i>, The aliens Forget-me-not (<i>Myasotis scorpioides</i>) and
the grass <i>Microstegium vimineum</i>, the bullrushs <i>Scirpus 
cyperinus</i> and <i>S</i>. 
<i>polyphyllus</i>, Rice Cutgrass (<i>Leersia 
oryzoides</i>),  an isolated Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>),  Small
Yellow Crownbeard (<i>Verbesina occidentalis</i>),  Purple-leaved Willowherb
(<i>Epilobium coloratum</i>),  Small-flowered St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum 
mutilum</i>),  Arrow-leaf Tearthumb (<i>Polygonum sagittatum</i>), 
Rough Cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla norvegica</i>),  false Pimpernel (<i>Lindernia dubia</i>),  Marsh Purslane
(<i>Ludwigia palustris</i>),  Barnyard Grass (<i>Echinochloa crusgalli</i>),  Black Willow (<i>Salix 
nigra</i>),  Common Monkey-flower (<i>Mimulus
 ringens
</i>), Ditch Stonecrop (<i>Penthorum sedoides</i>),  Calingale (<i>Cyperus</i> <i>strigosus</i>),  water
Smartweed (<i>Polygonum punctatum</i>),  False Nettle (<i>Boehmeria 
cylindrica</i>),  the alien cress <i>Cardamine impatiens</i>, Climbing False Buckwheat (<i>Polygonum 
scandens</i>) and Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>) .
<p> Spice Bush was extraordinarily abundant and vigorous
on much of the flood plain near the stream. However, as we returned downstream
on the east side of the River, nearer the upland, we moved beneath a heavy
canopy of large White Pine and Tuliptree and at least one large,
healthy-appearing Butternut. Fauna greeting us here were numerous tiny black
flies  (likely &quot;punkies&quot;)  that bit us about the eyes.

<b>Statons Creek Falls Vicinity</b>

<p><b>Source Walk: 10-7-98</b>
</ul>
<p>Statons Creek, a major tributary of the upper Pedlar
River, drains some of the loftiest parts of the Watershed. Underlying much of
the area is a coarse-grained leucocratic charnockite gneiss, a rock that is
well-exposed at Statons Creek Falls. On our brief visit to the area during the
morning of the 7th of October the water was low and there was no visible mist
from the Falls.
<p> Our inventory was virtually confined to a shallow
ravine immediately south of the Falls. A benchmark just above the Falls has an
elevation of 2107 feet  (633 m) asl, and our inventory extended between 50 and
100 feet higher in elevation. The aspect of the ravine is generally due north.
<p> Canopy species along the Creek appeared to be
dominated by White Pine and Sycamore, but those of the ravine were quite
different. Conspicuous above the rocky bank at the edge of the ravine
forest,immediately south of the Falls, was an evergreen rhododendron, either
Great or Catawba (<i>Rhododendron</i> <i>maximum</i>
or <i>R. 
catawbiense</i>),  in a wilted state, either as a result of dry
conditions or diease. Similarly wilted rhododendron was also seen at scattered
locations along the road on the approach from the Pedlar River.
<p> Within the ravine, which contained an active
springbrook, the canopy was dominated by mostly defoliated and presumably
Adelgid-infested Canada Hemlock with abundant Yellow Birch and less common
Black Birch, Tuliptree, White Ash, Red and Sugar Maples, Northern Red Oak,
American Basswood, Cucumbertree, Bitternut and Pignut Hickories, and on the
adjacent slope, Chestnut Oak. The age of this canopy appeared to be young to
barely mature. 
<p> Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>) was conspicuous in the
understory, while shrubs included Spice Bush, Witch Hazel, Wild Hydrangea,
Black Elderberry and Flowering Raspberry (<i>Rubus odoratus</i>) . Vines noted were Virginia
Creeper, Poison Ivy and Dutchman's Pipe vine (<i>Aristolochia</i> <i>macrophylla</i>) .
<p> Herbs, even at this late season, were diverse.
Identified were Christmas Fern, Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>), 
Marginal Shield Fern (<i>D. marginalis</i>),  Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium 
virginianum</i>),  a Clintonia, likely White (<i>Clintonia umbellulata</i>), 
Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i>
), Mountain Aster (<i>A. acuminatus</i>),  Crooked-stem Aster, Curtis
Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii</i>),  Broad leaf goldenrod (<i>S. flexicaulis</i>),  the forest wetland
sedge <i>Carex scabrata</i>, Drooping Wood Reed Grass (<i>Cinna latifolia</i>),  Wild
Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>),  American Spikenard (<i>A. 
racemosa</i>),  Miterwort (<i>Mitella diphylla</i>),  Tall Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum 
pubescens</i>),  Horse Balm (<i>Collinsonia canadensis</i>),  very large and abundant
Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>),  Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella 
repens</i>) mostly intergrown with mosses, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain (
<i>Goodyera 
pubescens</i>),  Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>) Downy
Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia
</i>), Tall Cone Flower, Panicled Hawkweed (<i>
Hieracium paniculatum</i>),  White
Baneberry (<i>Actaea pachypoda</i>),  Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina 
racemosa</i>),  the Tick-trefoil <i>Desmodium nudiflorum</i>, Indian Turnip, Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa 
bracteata</i>),  a sanicle (<i>Sanicula</i> sp),  Clearweed (<i>Pilea pumila</i>) . and in
association with the springbrook, Turtlehead, Golden Saxifrage (<i>Chrysosplenium americanum</i>),  Lettuce Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga micranthidifolia</i>),  the manna grass <i>Glyceria 
melicaria</i> and the alien
cress <i>Cardamine impatiens</i>.
<p> Mosses were abundant in the ravine forest. Most
widespread appeared to be Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>), 
followed by unidentified species of <i>Mnium</i>, <i>Brachythecium</i> and <i>Hypnum</i>,
with the last-named apparently virtually confined to large woody debris. A
small patch of Tree Moss (<i>Climacium americanum</i>) was also seen.
<p> A heavy growth of mosses also occurred at the ravine
forest edge on the road bank facing the Falls. Most impressive here was <i>Rhytidiadelphus triquetr&#19;us</i>.
It seems likely that this and other
mosses near the Falls are related to mists generated by the falling water when
the stream is high enough for this to occur for extended periods, as in the
spring. It is also likely that the occurrence of Yellow Birch and other cold
climate species in the ravine forest is favored by the cooling effect of this
mist during the early growing season.
<p> Although
no attempt was made to inventory fauna, a very active, dark-bodied Dusky
Salamander (<i>Desmognathus </i> sp)  was seen in the ravine's springbrook.
<p> It is likely that an inventory extending throughout
the growing season would greatly expand the ravine flora and fauna. The same
would probably hold for the immediate vicinity of the Falls, which might harbor
some uncommon species. These conclusions are particularly applicable to the
vernal flora. In any case there is an implication that the charnockite bedrock
here is capable of yielding rich soils of an acid/mesic nature.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><b>Cole Mountain</b>
<p><b>Source Walk: 10-6-98</b>
<ul>
<p>During the morning of the 6th we ascended Cole
Mountain along the Appalachian Trail from Hog Camp Gap. This traverse lies
along the extreme southeastern edge of the Pedlar Watershed at the divide from
that of the Buffalo River. Elevations ranged from 3510 feet  (1071 m)  to 3881
 (1184 m)  asl along the traverse. Visibility was limited by heavy mist/cloud
cover which wetted clothing but was not unpleasantly cold. In the following
narration of our ascent species and terrain features are generally listed in
the order of their observatiom.
<p> The canopy at the start of our ascent was young, with
few trees in excess of one foot  (0.3 m)  dbh. Dominant species were Northern
Red Oak and Shagbark Hickory, with minor White Ash and Black and Yellow
Birches. A single Virginia Juniper was seen. The understory consisted of
Striped Maple, Alternate-leaved Dogwood (<i>
Cornus alternifolia</i>) and Mountain
Holly (<i>Ilex montana
</i>). Coral Berry was an important shrub, as was Allegheny Blackberry (<i>Rubus 
allegheniensis</i>) and Smooth Gooseberry (<i>Ribes rotundifolia</i>) . A
little Wild Hydrangea was also present.
<p> Herbs on this lower slope were dominated by
Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>),  with less frequent White
Heath Aster (<i>Aster pilosus</i>
), Five-leaved Gentian (<i>Gentiana quinquefolia</i>),  Cut-leaf Grapefern (<i>Botrychium 
dissectum</i>),  Virginia Strawberry (<i>Fragaria virginiana</i>), 
Hairy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum lanuginosum</i>),  Columbine (<i>Aquilegia 
canadensis</i>),  Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia quadrifolia</i>), 
Star Campion (<i>Silene stellata</i>) and Long-leaved Bluet (<i>Houstonia 
longifolia</i>) . Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex</i>),  an
oat grass,  likely Poverty Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia spicata</i>),  the alien Canada Bluegrass (<i>Poa 
compressa</i>),  an unidentified haircap moss (<i>Polytrichum</i> sp)  and <i>Leucobryum</i> cushion moss appeared to be
limited to a shallow acid-soil layer at the Trail edge. Here also we
experienced a high point of our traverse, namely one of the largest and fattest
American Toads (<i>Bufo americanus</i>
) any of us had ever seen, and which had probably been brought out by the moist
air. Concealed in a patch of Allegheny Blackberry, it had the calm demeanor of
a true veteran and seemed not to object to being handled.
<p> Continuing our climb, we saw Curtis Goldenrod. Ground
Pine (<i>Lycopodium flabelliform</i>),  another acidiphile, 
also at the Trail edge, Panicled Hawkweed, <i>Panicum boscii</i>, Blue Wood Aster and large,
vigorous vines of Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax herbacea</i>),  which bore clusters of large
blue berries. Here also we discovered several dark woodland (<i>Plethodon</i>) salamanders concealed in the
interior of a thoroughly rotted, foot -thick down bole..
<p> Next noted in succession were the apparent prevalence
of Delicate Fern Moss at the bases of lichen-covered Shagbark, the calls of
Ravens (<i>Corvus corax</i>),  White Snakeroot, the particular abundance of one
foot  (0.3 m)  dbh or smaller Shagbark and the common occurrence of sprouts and
residual down wood of American Chestnut (<i>
Castanea dentata</i>) ..
<p> We then came upon our first Sugar Maple in the form
of saplings, followed by Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda claytoniana</i>) and the uncommon grass <i>Calamagrostis porteri</i>. Here Hay-scented Fern was again the dominant ground
cover, but was accompanied by the common forest sedge <i>Carex</i> <i>laxiflora</i>, Autumn Bent grass (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>),  Marginal Shield Fern and a
little Hog Peanut. Common mosses were <i>Hedwigia ciliata 
</i>on the granitic rocks and at tree bases, <i>Brotherella recurvans</i>,
species of <i>Thuidium</i>, <i>Brachythecium</i>, <i>Anomodon</i> and <i>Dicranum</i>, as
well as a species of the liverwort <i>Metzgeria</i>. Also noted were Sugar Maple saplings with a
striking bark pattern of what appeared to be a greenish-white crustose lichen
in large uniform patches. These were followed by the fungus <i>Panellus 
stipticus</i> on dead wood, the
sedge <i>Carex pensylvanica</i> at the
Trail-side and a small sapling of Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya virginiana</i>) .
<p> Now continuing upward, we saw False Turkeytail (<i>Stereum 
ostrea</i>) fungus, Smooth- forked 
Chickweed (<i>Paronychia canadensis</i>),  a few small Black Locust (
<i>Robinia</i> <i>pseudoacacia</i>),  a
skullcap (<i>Scutellaria </i> sp),  Trail Rush (<i>Juncus tenuis</i>) and more
large Carrion Flower.
<p> Here we became aware of the heavy concentration of
macro-lichens on the south sides of trees, except where the forest was open in
other directions, in which case the lichens grew to face the opening. Dominant
canopy species were Shagbark Hickory, Black Birch and Northern Red Oak,
accompanied by Sugar Maple saplings Striped Maple and American Chestnut
sprouts. Dead wood here bore the fungus 
<i>Daedaleopsis confragosa </i>, among others.
<p> Some large rock outcrops which had an extensive cover
of bryophytes now came into view. On examination these proved to include
unidentified species of the mosses <i>Dicranum,
Thuidium </i>and <i>Bracythecium</i>, as
well as <i>Hedwigia ciliata</i> 
and <i>Rhodobryum roseum</i> and a liverwort of the genus <i>Porella .</i> Additional bryophytes may also have been present. Nearby we saw
Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium filix-femina</i>), 
Christmas and Rock Ferns. Also present were White Wood Aster (<i>Aster 
divaricatus</i>),  Big-leaf Aster, Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>), 
patches of<i>Cladina</i> lichen, rather stunted Mountain Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia 
compressa</i>),  and farther along, Hispid Greenbrier (<i>Smilax hispida</i>) . The canopy
was now dominated by Northern Red Oak, Yellow Birch and Shagbark Hickory laden
with nuts. Noted also was the fungus <i>Tyromyces</i> <i>chioneus</i>,
known as the &quot;Cheese Polypore&quot;, although inedible, and patches of a
tall grass, long past its prime, which was eventually identified as Drooping
Wood Reed Grass.
<p> We now approached another large outcrop amid an
increase in Yellow Birch with the fungus <i>Collybia confluens 
</i>on the forest floor. This rock was graced by a diverse flora of
bryophytes, lichens and vascular plants, including particularly dense growths
of <i>Dicranum</i> moss, Rock Fern, Marginal Shield Fern, Wild Liveforever (<i>Sedum 
telephioides</i>),  an unidentified gooseberry (<i>Ribes </i> sp)  that had shed
its leaves, <i>Cladina </i>lichens, and the umbilicate lichen <i>Lasallia 
papulosa </i>. Beyond the outcrop Yellow Birch continued abundant in
association with Shagbark Hickory and a single healthy-appearing Hemlock. As we
continued our climb we saw an isolated Tall Cone Flower, Bottlebrush Grass (<i>Hystrix 
patula</i>),  Basil Balm (<i>Monarda
 clinopodia</i>
), a <i>Brachythecium</i> moss, Dutchman's Pipe vine (<i>Aristolochia macrophylla</i>),  Virgin's
Bower (<i>Clematis virginiana</i>),  American Hazelnut, Smooth
Sweet Cicely, Tall White Lettuce (<i>Prenanthes altissima</i>),  Blue Wood Aster and a
concentration of beautiful lichen-covered,nut-bearing Shagbark.
<p> A little to the left of the Trail, in a semi-opening,
we were attracted to a cluster of tall  (10 ft/3m)  flower stalks of Cow
Parsnip (<i>Heracleum maximum</i>),  which was followed along the
Trail by Tall Goldenrod (<i>Solidago altissima</i>),  Nimblewill (<i>Muhlenbergia schreberi</i>),  Selfheal and, near the top of the slope by
Silverrod (<i>Solidago bicolor</i>) and Cutleaf Goldenrod (<i>S. 
arguta </i> var <i>boottii</i>
).
<p> On reaching the local summit of Cole Mountain we
entered open terrain, which was kept so by mowing, a typical pointless an
destructive activity of the US Forest Service. Here,  at almost 3900 feet (
1140 m)  asl were scattered Alternate-leaf Dogwood, White Ash, Black Cherry,
Pitch Pine and, chiefly on the north side, Yellow and Black Birches. Coral
Berry, mostly cut close to the ground, was the most abundant shrub, but there
were also large, vigorous patches of American Hazelnut laden with nuts (
gathered by us!) . Ground cover consisted of a mix of native and alien herbs,
including Virginia Strawberry, the aliens Toadflax (<i>Linaria vulgaris</i>) and Spotted Knapweed (<i>Centaurea maculosa</i>),  among
others. No ericaceae were observed on this summit or anywhere on the traverse.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul><b>Return to the Pedlar River</b>

<br><b>Source Walks: 5-17-99, 5-28-99 and 5-29-99</b>
<ul> 
<p>Our May, 1999 visits to the Pedlar River Watershed
included three sites. The first of these was the flood plain at Oronoco
previously visited in autumn, 1998, the second was an upland slope site on the
east side of the Valley about four miles  (6.4 km)  south of Oronoco along
Forest Road 39, while the third was at the Pedlar River crossing of FR 39.
<p> The weather at Oronoco on the morning of 5-17-99 was
cool and partly cloudy. Scarlet Tanagers and Red-eyed Vireos (<i>Vireo 
olivaceus</i>) called frequently in the vicinity of the campground.
Also noted in the vicinity were White-flowered Leafcup (<i>Polymnia canadensis</i>), 
Nodding Fescue, Rattlesnake Fern, <i>Carex
amphibola</i> in full bloom, the alien
Bulbous Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus bulbosa</i>),  Hooked Crowfoot (<i>R. recurvatus</i>),  Spring Avens (<i>Geum 
vernum</i>) and Philadelphia Fleabane (<i>Erigeron philadelphicus</i>) .
A little <i>Medeola</i> was seen under White Pine.
<p> On entering the mature flood plain forest on the east
side of the River,we noted a canopy dominated by large White Pine and
Tuliptree, the call of an Ovenbird (<i>Seiurus aurocapillus</i>) and a substantial patch
of Showy Orchid (<i>Orchis spectabilis</i>) in full bloom. Other woody
species seen here were Northern&nbsp;Red Oak  (some large),  Muscletree and
Witch Hazel. Also noted was a Pine Warbler (<i>Dendroica pinus</i>) . We soon
came to a springbrook in a deep trench, perhaps an old stream channel. Here in
the stream bed and/or on the adjacent bank were Golden Saxifrage, Lettuce
Saxifrage, Intermediate Shield Fern, Pennsylvania Bitter Cress (<i>Cardamine 
pensylvanica</i>),  Virginia Knotweed, Skunk Cabbage (<i>Symplocarpus foetidus</i>),  a clump of tall blooming Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio 
aureus</i>),  Wild Hydrangea, <i>Carex laevivaginata,</i> Plume Lily, Blue
Monkshood (<i>Aconitum uncinatum</i>),  Wood Nettle, Christmas
Fern, Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria pubera</i>) in bloom, Steel's Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum 
steeleanum</i>),  Miami Mist (<i>Phacelia purshii</i>),  also in bloom, the mosses <i>Rhynchostegium serrulatum</i> on soil and rotting wood and <i>Cirriphyllum boscii</i>. Found
in the vicinity were <i>Carex amphibola</i>, Kidney-leaf Crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus</i> <i>abortivus</i>),  Wild
Geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>) in bloom, the toothwort <i>Dentaria 
maxima </i> (or <i>Cardamine</i> x<i>
maxima</i>) and Spice Bush. Ovenbird,  Crow and Red-shouldered Hawk (<i>Buteo 
lineatus</i>) were heard here. Also striking were three foot  (1m), 
well-rounded boulders that appeared to be part of the stream's bedload and
testimony of its power in flood.
<p> Continuing upstream we encountered<i>Carex 
gracillima</i>, Downy Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum pubescens</i>),  here in a more shady
environment than the Common species, then the greenbrier <i>Smilax bona-nox</i>, Maple-leaf
Viburnum (<i>Viburnum acerifolium</i>),  Flowering Dogwood,
Carrion Flower and a lady beetle, red,without spots. Following these we saw <i>Carex 
prasina</i>, Oswego Tea (<i>Monarda didyma</i>) in an unfamiliar low elevation
habitat, Tall Agrimony, Black Haw Viburnum, Four-leaved Yam, American Basswood
in some abundance, White Ash, Virgin's Bower,  Cleavers (<i>Galium aperine</i>),  a lily (<i>Lilium</i> 
sp),  Dutchman's Breeches (<i>Dicentra
 cucullaria
</i>) long past flowering, Bottlebrush Grass,  Sycamore and a large White Pine.
Here also was abundant Spreading Chervil (<i>Chaerophyllum procumbens</i>) in the dense shade of the
forest floor, the call of an Ovenbird, Coralberry, Sugar Maple, Nodding Fescue,
Wingstem, <i>Potentilla simplex</i>, Blood Root (<i>Sanquinaria 
canadensis</i>),  Wild Ginger (<i>
Asarum canadense</i>), <i>Atrichum</i> moss and, in a more open area, a few of the aliens Japaese
Honeysuckle, Multiflora Rose (<i>Rosa multiflora</i>) and Autumn Olive (<i>Elaeagnus 
umbellata</i>) . 
<p> Next seen was an association of <i>Atrichum</i> and Delicate Fern
mosses, <i>Medeola</i>, Violet Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis 
violacea</i>) not here in bloom, and Red Maple seedlings,with nearby
Deer-tongue Grass. Heard here also was a possible Solitary Vireo (<i>Vireo 
solitarius</i>) and another Ovenbird. These were followed by <i>Carex 
laxiflora</i>, <i>C. laxiculmis</i>, <i>C. rosea</i>, Wild Stonecrop (<i>Sedum 
ternatum</i>) in bloom, then Canada Brome Grass (<i>Bromus pubescens </i> or <i>B. 
purgans</i>),  Indian Turnip, Virginia Strawberry, Wrinkle-leaf
Goldenrod, an <i>Atrichum </i>moss, likely <i>A. 
undulatum</i>, Crooked-stem Aster and <i>Carex stipata </i> var <i>stipata</i>.. It should be mentioned that
Scarlet Tanager calls were heard throughout the traverse.
<p> The upland site four miles south of Oronoco, which
was inventoried by us in the afternoon, lay perhaps 500 feet  (150 m) in
elevation above the River on a generally westerly aspect. Here we followed a
woods road for a short distance down-slope. Bedrock here appeared to be a
granitic, perhaps charnockitic gneiss, the soil and subsoil deep reddish clay.
In places this soil bore a mor several inches thick.
<p> The vegetation on this slope was broadly dry mesic in
character, with a canopy consisting of Black, Northern Red, Chestnut and White
Oaks, Tuliptree, White Pine, Black Birch, White Ash, Cucumbertree, Pignut
Hickory  (likely <i>Carya glabra</i>),  Sassafras and severely
Adelgid-infested Canada Hemlock. Understory included Flowering and
Alternate-leaf Dogwoods and American Chestnut sprouts. Northern Red Oak
seedlings were common. Shrubs noted were Witch Hazel, Maple-leaf Viburnum,
Pennsylvania Blackberry (<i>Rubus pensilvanicus</i>
) and Upland Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>) . Canopy trees ranged to over
two feet  (o.6 m)  dbh and had good forms.
<p> Herbs seen on a dry part of the slope were Rue
Anemone (<i>Anemonella</i> <i>thalictroides
</i>), Dittany (<i>Cunila origanoides</i>),  Panicled Hawkweed (<i>Hieracium</i> <i>paniculatum</i>),  Curtis
Goldenrod, <i>Carex communis</i>, <i>C. digitalis</i>, Downy
Rattlesnake Plantain,<i>Potentilla simplex</i>, the woodrush <i>Luzula 
multiflora</i>, Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia sessilifolia</i>) and
Slender-leaved Summer Bluets (<i>Houstonia tenuifolia</i>) . <i>Atrichum</i> was a widespread moss on soil but <i>Polytrichum</i> was associated with Chestnut Oak and Upland Low
Blueberry on mor. In a more mesic section we saw Hog Peanut, Cut-leaf Grape
fern (<i>Botrychium dissectum</i>),  Squaw Root (<i>Conopholis 
americana</i>),  Christmas Fern, Hairy Disporum, Downy Heuchera (<i>Heuchera 
pubescens</i>),  the wedge grass<i>
Sphenopholis intermedia</i> and a
little Columbine. Birds heard and/or seen were Ovenbird, Yellow-billed Cuckoo (
<i>Coccyzus 
americanus</i>),  Pileated Woodpecker (<i>Dryocopus pileatus</i>) and a
very loud Carolina Wren (<i>Thryothorus
ludovicianus</i>) . 
<p> At the Pedlar River crossing of FR 39 we first
explored along a small branch under a canopy of Tuliptree, white Pine, Black
Walnut, Black Birch, White Ash, Sycamore, Red Maple and a little Slippery
Elm.Understory consisted of Muscletree and Paw Paw (<i>Asimina triloba</i>) and
there was a shrub layer of Spice Bush, Witch Hazel and Wild Hydrangea, Japanese
Honeysuckle was also present, while herbs noted were Wild Geranium, already
gone to seed, Virginia Knotweed, <i>Potentilla
simplex</i>, Horse Balm, the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum
 erectum</i>,
Small Yellow Crownbeard, Turtlehead, Black Cohosh, <i>Panicum boscii</i>, <i>Carex 
scabrata</i> and <i>C. bromoides</i>. A Scarlet Tanager was heard
here.
<p> We next did an inventory along the left bank of the
Pedlar River just downstream from the FR 39 crossing. Our traverse here was
within the ecotone between the dry, rocky upland forest and the sandy River
strand. Thus there were unusual juxtapositions of species. The canopy here
appeared to be dominated by Beech of generally healthy appearance which was
mature but not large. Redbud (<i>Circis canadensis</i>) formed an understory.
Successively noted as we proceded downstream from the road were Violet Wood
Sorrel, here in bloom, <i>Carex torta </i>in the stream bed, and of greatest
interest, abundant Yellowroot (<i>Xanthorhiza simplicissima</i>) just coming into bloom.
Following these were found the wood rush <i>Luzula echinata</i>, <i>Potentilla simplex</i>,
abundant Maple-leaf Viburnum, Wild Sage (<i>Salvia lyrata</i>),  also in bloom, Smooth Alder,
Muscletree, Spring Bluets (<i>Houstonia caerulea</i>) in bloom, Sweet Vernal Grass,
more Yellowroot, the tall sedge<i>
Carex gynandra </i>, Bottlebrush Grass,
Black Haw Viburnum, Adelgid-infested Hemlock, Crested Dwarf Iris (<i>Iris 
cristata</i>),  more Redbud and Beech.
<p> After moving perhaps 1/6 mile  (0.3 km)  down the
Pedlar's left bank, the stream was forded and a return made along the right
bank. Species noted were Umbrellatree (<i>Magnolia tripetala</i>),  Pinxter Azalea in bloom,
Ox-eye (<i>Heliopsis helianthoides</i>),  Winter Grape, Whorled
Tickseed (<i>Coreopsis verticillata</i>
), Wood Tickseed (<i>C. major</i>),  Winterberry Holly, Pasture Rose
(<i>Rosa 
carolina</i>),  Cranefly Orchid (<i>
Tipularia discolor</i>),  Scarlet Oak,
Fringe Tree, Gray Beardtongue (<i>Penstemon canescens</i>),  <i>Carex pensylvanica</i>,
Deerberry, Woodland Sunflower (<i>Helianthus divaricatus</i>) and Chinquapin (<i>Castanea 
pumila</i>) .
<p> Our inventory of 5-28-99 began at 10:00 AM, with the
weather clear, cool and pleasant, and was confined to the immediate vicinity of
the Oronoco campground. Conspicuous on this day was the great number of
swallowtail butterflies, including particularly the large Tiger (<i>Papilio 
glaucus</i>) . Also omnipresent were the Silver-spotted Skipper (<i>Epargyreus 
clarus</i>) in small numbers and the calls of Red-eyed Vireos. Close to
the Pedlar River, on the campground's west side, we noted the abundance of
Ash-leaf Maple seedlings and saplings, Spice Bush, seedlings of Red Maple,
Coralberry, Poison Ivy, Virginia Creeper, Virginia Knotweed, Plume Lily and
Rattlesnake Fern. Common Chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>) in places formed a prominent
ground cover in deep shade, while Nodding Fescue was practically the only grass
in this environment.
<p> Seen along the stream edge was more over-sized,
likely tetraploid, Common Many Knees and the alien herbs Celandine (<i>Chelidanum 
majus</i>) and Nipplewort (<i>
Lapsana communis</i>),  while Miami
Mist in full bloom formed large patches in openings there. Other species seen
on this part of the flood plain included a ten inch  (0.25 m)  dbh Butternut,
Wingstem, Virginia Strawberry, Common Speedwell (<i>Veronica officinalis</i>) in
bloom, Clearweed, Deer-tongue Grass, <i>Potentilla
 simplex</i>, Japanese Honeysuckle and,
in places, rampant English Ivy. Of interest also was a one-inch gray-brown bug
with orange-tipped antennae in low vegetation and in deep shade. Along the road
both Kentucky and Rough Bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i> and <i>P. trivialis</i>) were common.
<p> While 5-29-99 dawned bright and pleasant we were not
greeted by the Wood Thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustelina</i>) we might have expected, nor
had we heard any owls or Whip-poor Wills (<i>Caprimulgus vociferus</i>) during the night. Indeed,
none of these birds was seen or heard on our entire visit. Our traverse this
day was again through the rich flood plain southeast of the Pedlar River.
Beginning in the vicinity of the campground and close to the River, we noted in
succession the call of a Scarlet Tanager, Spring Avens, a Catbird (<i>Dumetella 
carolinensis</i>),  a very little Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila 
maculata</i>) in the only occurrence seen on the traverse, the grass <i>Bromus 
latiglumis</i>, Allegheny Blackberry, a wild rye (<i>Elymus </i> sp),  Sensitive
Fern, Wild Hydrangea, more wild rye, Slippery Elm, an Ovenbird,over-sized
Common Many Knees; then on the River bank, Wood Nettle, Basil Balm, strikingly
and beautifully striped Indian Turnip, and at the water's edge, Fowl Managrass
(<i>Glyceria striata</i>) .
<p> We now came to where a springbrook discharged into
the River. Here we noted <i>Carex lurida</i>, Larger Water Starwort (<i>Callitriche 
heterophylla</i>),  Ditch Stonecrop, Sweet Vernal Grass, the alien
Broad-leaf Dock (<i>Rumex obtusifolius
</i>), a cress (<i>Rorippa</i> sp),  Small-flowered St. Johns-wort, the
rush <i>Juncus</i> <i>effusus</i>, Common
Monkey-flower, Crayfish, a Newt, a Tree Frog and a heavy growth of <i>Atrichum</i> moss on the bank. Continuing up the springbrook we saw Clearweed,
became aware of the granitic character of cobbles in the bed, <i>Amblystegium</i> moss on these wet cobbles and water penny beetles  (Psephenidae) 
on their lower surfaces. Here also were the alien Soapwort (<i>Saponaria 
officinalis</i>),  Northern Bugleweed and, on the bank, Wild Crabapple (
<i>Malus 
coronaria</i>) .
<p> We then left the springbrook and entered the flood
plain forest from the brook's right bank. Here the canopy was dominated by
large White Pine and almost as large Tuliptree with smaller Sycamore, Red
Maple, Shagbark Hickory, Cucumbertree and White Ash, with many seedlings of the
latter. Muscletree formed an understory and Spice Bush and Black Haw Viburnum a
shrub layer. Dominant herbs appeared to be Smooth Sweet Cicely and a meadowrue. 
<p> Continuing in the direction of the River again we
encountered some small Beech, apparently healthy, but in one instance, partly
girdled by Beaver. Noted in succession then were American Basswood, a single
small Striped Maple, the call of an Ovenbird, <i>Medeola</i>, Virginia Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum
 virginianum
</i>), a lily of unidentified species and quite abundant, although browsed off
by Deer; then Nodding Fescue, Basil Balm and a 22 inch  (0. 56 m)  dbh
Tuliptree with a 4 inch  (10 cm)  grape vine and a large Poison Ivy vine
ascending it. These were followed by Cleavers, Honewort, Indian Turnip,
Four-leaved Yam, Plume Lily, Maple-leaf Viburnum in bloom in deep shade, Common
Chickweed, another Ovenbird call, abundant Spreading Chervil, <i>Potentilla simplex</i>, Poison Ivy,
Carrion Flower, Coralberry and Tall Coneflower. Here we noted the apparent dominance of Delicate
Fern Moss among the large conspicuous mosses on down wood, also the common
occurrence of Rattlesnake Fern, here with Squaw Root, <i>Bromus latiglumis</i>, Black
Cherry, small Sugar Maple and Ash-leaf Maple. Continuing, we heard a Tufted
Titmouse (<i>Parus bicolor</i>) and a number of unidentified
birds, saw a mint of the genus <i>Stachys</i>,
White Baneberry, the Dryad Saddle fungus (<i>Polyporus squamosus</i>),  a single plant of Adder's
Tongue fern (<i>Ophioglossum vulgatum</i> var <i>picnosticum</i>),  Black Elderberry and Virgin's Bower.
<p> We now entered a semi-opening near the River, where
we saw Blue Monkshood, Velvet Grass (<i>Holcus 
lanatus</i>),  <i>Carex bromoides</i>, the blue-eyed grass <i>Sisyrinchium angustifolium</i>, Late Goldenrod (<i>Solidago gigantea</i>) and
Winterberry Holly .We terminated our traverse here.

<p> <b>Summary</b>
<ul> 
<p> Considered together, the Oronoco Area, Statons Creek
Falls vicinity and Cole Mountain are remarkable for the poverty of ericaceae,
possibly a reflection of the widespread occurrence of the charnockite bedrock
under the prevailing climate regime.With regard to climate, it is interesting
that although the Pedlar Valley flat at Oronoco is similar in topographic
location and elevation and as close to
high ridges as is Horseshoe Run in West Virginia, the latter is markedly richer
in cold climate species such as Yellow Birch, Striped Maple and Canada
Mayflower (see <a href=horseshoe.htm>our section on Horseshoe Run</a>). Of course Horseshoe Run lies
Approximately 100 miles  (160 km)  farther north. However the ridges here are
higher than those, such as Backbone Mountain, that overlook Horseshoe Run . In
contrast to Cole Mountain, which barely tolerates Yellow Birch and other
northern species even on northern aspects, and which has a more typically Appalachian
flora, Backbone Mountain is covered by northern hardwoods with a Red Spruce
component at high elevations. It is likely that these differences are a
consequence of the milder, less continental and montane regional climate of the
Blue Ridge,as contrasted with the Alleghenies. As we have seen, the presence of
cold climate species at the relatively modest elevation of Statons Creek Falls
may be a result of the special influence of the Falls.
