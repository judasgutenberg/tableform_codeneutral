<h1>Petite's Gap</h1><b>May, 2002
</b><blockquote>  <p><b>Source Walk: 7-2-95</b><ul><p> Petite's Gap, at 2461 feet (750 meters) asl and
37<sup>o</sup>34' N latitude, lies between two federally-designated wilderness areas, the
James River Face and Thunder Ridge to the northeast and southwest
respectively. The terrain is moderately
rugged and the country rock is Pre-Cambrian layered pyroxene granulite. Major minerals are quartz, plagioclase and
potassium feldspars, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and magnetite-ilmenite oxides. Garnet, Hornblende and biotite are widespread
and apatite and zircon are minor constituents (Rader and Evans,
1993). These constituents, particularly the
feldspars, pyroxenes, garnet, hornblende and biotite, provide a considerable
variety of mineral nutrients that are not as readily available in the
sandstones and quartzites that dominate the western Blue Ridge. These nutrients encourage development of
better soils and, as we shall see, a rich and diverse flora.<p> Traverses
were made along the Appalachian Trail for a short distance from the road into
each of the Wilderness areas to inventory the flora and as much as possible the
local fauna as well. The initial and
shortest traverse, about 0.2 miles (300 meters), was made into the James River
Face Wilderness. The aspect here is
southwest, the forest canopy open and this sunny July day well chosen to
acquaint one with light conditions.<p> Tuliptree (<i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i>) and
pignut hickory ( <i>Carya glabra</i> and/or <i>C. ovalis</i>) dominate the canopy, with Northern Red Oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) and Black Cherry (<i>Prunus serotina</i>) also common. Less abundant are American Basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>), Red Maple (<i>Acer rubrum</i>), Bitternut Hickory (<i>Carya cordiformis</i>), Black Walnut (<i>Juglans nigra</i>), and White Ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>). 
There are also scattered White Pine (<i>Pinus strobus</i>), American Chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>) sprouts and small Hackberry,
probably <i>Celtis occidentalis</i>. Many trees are of mature size and some
Tuliptrees exceed 2 feet (0.6 meters) dbh. From the appearance of these trees, many with side limbs stripped away,
it is likely that the canopy was opened up by ice storms. The abundant light that reaches the forest
floor as a consequence, set the stage for a rank growth of native shrubs, vines
and tall herbs uncharacteristic of typical deciduous forests with more closed
canopies. Understory consists of
Service Berry (<i>Amelanchier arborea</i>?). Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>), Muscletree (<i>Carpinus caroliniana</i>) and
Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus florida</i>), the latter somewhat diseased, probably by Anthracnose. There is also some Sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>), which thrives
only where light is abundant, and seldom reaches canopy size. The shrub layer is characterized by some
species quite demanding of soil conditions. Examples of these are Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>), Black Haw Viburnum (<i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>), Black Raspberry (<i>Rubus occidentalis</i>) and CoralBerry (<i>Symphoricarpos orbiculatus</i>) . However, these are accompanied by the less-demanding Alternate-leaved
Dogwood (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i>), Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i>), Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum acerifolium</i>) and thorned 
blackberries. Also reflecting the 
superior growing conditions are diverse vines including Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</i>) (very abundant), Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus radicans</i>), Dutchman's Pipe Vine (<i>Aristolochia macrophylla</i>), Summer Grape (<i>Vitis</i> <i>aestivalis</i>), Canada Moonseed <i>(Menispermum canadense) </i> and several species of Smilax, such as Common<i></i>Greenbrier<i> (Smilax rotundifolia</i>) and Carrion Flower (<i>S. herbacea</i>) <p> Tall herbs favored by the open canopy include many of
the aster family Examples are
Broad-leaf, Wreath and Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrods (<i>Solidago flexicaulis</i>, <i>S.c&aelig;sia</i> and <i>S. rugosa </i>), Late purple, White Wood, Bigleaf and Wavy-leaf Asters (<i>Asterpatens</i>, <i>A. divaricatus</i>, <i>A.macrophyllus </i>and <i>A. undulatus</i>), Wingstem (<i>Verbesina alternifolia) </i>, Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium purpureum)</i>,
White Snakeroot (<i>E. rugosum</i>), Thin-leaved Sunflower (<i>Helianthus decapetalus</i>), Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio aureus</i>), Gall-of-the-Earth (<i>Prenanthes</i> sp.) and Wild Lettuce (<i>Lactuca</i> sp.). Tall herbs of other families noted were Black Cohosh ( <i>Cimicifuga
racemosa</i>), Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens</i> sp.), Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>), Agrimony (probably <i>Agrimonia gryposepala</i>), Lopseed (<i>Phryma leptostachya</i>) in spectacular bloom, Basil Balm (<i>Monarda clinopodia</i>), Horse-balm (<i>Collinsonia canadensis</i>), Spreading Dogbane (<i>Apocynum androsaemifolium</i>) and Virginia Knotweed (<i>Polygonum virginianum</i>). Of intermediate stature were a 
sanicle ( <i>Sanicula</i> sp.), Wild Columbine (<i>Aquilegia canadensis</i>) in
bloom, Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia
quadrifolia</i>), Enchanters Nightshade (<i>Circaea quadrisuleata</i>), Honewort (<i>Cryptotaenia canadensis</i>), Hairy-jointed
Meadow Parsnip (<i>Thaspium barbinode</i>), Plum Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>) heavy with green berries and much browsed by Deer, Common Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum biflorum</i>), Smooth Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhizalongistylis</i>), Golden Alexanders (<i>Zizia</i> sp.), White Avens (<i>Geum canadense</i>) and Dotted St. John's-wort (<i>Hypericum punctatum</i>).

<p> Although most of the small vernal flora had in all
likelihood long since been overwhelmed by the later tall growth, remnants were
represented by Bloodroot (<i>Sanguinaria canadensis</i>), Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia perfoliata</i>), Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria pubera </i>), Wild Geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>) and Virginia Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum</i>). Where
favored by shade or other conditions, late maturing small plants such as
Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum), </i>Canada Violet (<i>Viola canadensis</i>) in bloom, Upright
Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis stricta</i>) and Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium
virginianum</i>) were also in evidence. However, two species of ground level height, Common Speedwell (<i>Veronica officinalis</i>) and Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla canadensis/simplex</i>) were confined to a few isolatedpatches of almost bare ground. A plant
that deserves special mention here is Green Violet (<i>Hybanthus concolor</i>) representing a monotypic genus in the violet family but in appearance quite
unlike a violet. At this season it had
already formed its characteristic seed capsules.<p> Because the bedrock is similar on both sides of
Petites Gap, ascent of Thunder Ridge to the southwest provides an opportunity
to observe the effects of a northeast aspect. The traverse here is somewhat over a mile from the road to the upper

reaches of a strong brook at somewhat over 2800 ft (850 meters) asl. The canopy in the lower Gap at near 2500 ft
(760 meters) is dominated by Tuliptree, White Ash, Northern Red Oak and Canada
Hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>), with the last-named species showing severe defoliation by the Hemlock Wooly
Adelgid. Black Locust ( <i>Robinia pseudoacacia </i>) is also
common. Ground cover here consists
chiefly of Christmas (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>) and Marginal Shield (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>) Ferns, Indian Turnip, (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>), Indian Cucumber Root (<i>Medeola</i> <i>virginiana</i>) and Mountain Meadowrue ( <i>Thalictrumclavatum</i>). As we ascend, Hemlock
becomes less common and although a number of shrubs and herbs also occur on the
other side of the gap, dominance is clearly by a new assemblage. Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea arborescens )</i>, a shrub, which was not observed on the other side of the gap,becomes prominent as soon as a significant slope is reached. At this season, it was in full bloom and

extensively patronized by bumblebees. At perhaps 2600 ft (790 meters) a single shrub of Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex Montana) </i> was encountered, with the relatively low elevation
of this occurrence perhaps a response to the northeast aspect and plentiful
moisture. From this point the climb
successively revealed a small Butternut (<i>Juglans cinerea</i>), a characteristic brilliant black and yellow
Appalachian millipede with burnt almond odor (perhaps <i>Sigmoria aberrans</i>), the "Fire Weed" <i>Erechtites hieracifolia</i>, a small Slippery Elm (<i>Ulmus rubra</i>), much Christmas Fern, Cucumber
Magnolia (<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>), Maidenhair Fern (<i>Adiantum pedatum</i>), Black Birch, Wild
Ginger (<i>Asarum canadense</i>) and the
first May Apple (<i>Podophyllum peltatum</i>) of the day. At this point we reached a
small muddy seep in which was imprinted the clear track of a Bobcat ( <i>Lynx rufus</i>) accompanied by those
of White-tailed Deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>), including a fawn. Continuing upward we encountered the first
Blue Cohosh (<i>Coulophyllum thalictroides</i>) and nearby Goats Beard (<i>Aruncus dioicus</i>) already gone to seed; then a Hairy Sedge, (probably <i>Carex viresens</i>), a flat-coiled land snail shell and Black
Walnut. Somewhere here also, perhaps at
2700 ft (820 meters) elevation, Tuliptree practically dropped out and

 Striped


Maple became much more abundant. Then a
little higher appeared the first bush of Catawba Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron catawbiense</i>), perhaps reflecting
thinner soils and more rock exposure. As the trail rounded the ridge to a northwest aspect, the first Chestnut
Oak (<i>Quercus prinus</i>) was
here noted; then,
as it turned more
easterly again, the first Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>), always an indicator of cooler conditions.<p> On further ascent, the 
soils thinned more and thefirst Rock Fern appeared on exposed rock. However, in a more sheltered enclave of deeper soil just beyond,
occurred a single plant of the more demanding American Spikenard (<i>Araliaracemosa</i>). These were followed just
above by a few plants of Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila maculata</i>) and
Wake Bobin (<i>Trillium erectum</i>) which, in the absence of flowers, was identified by its rhombic leaf shape.<p> Above this level the trail wound to a more easterly
aspect through a characteristically mesic community of Hophornbeam, SummerGrape, Poke Milkweed (<i>Asclepias
exhaltata</i>) and Purple Bedstraw (<i>Galium
latifolium</i>) in bloom. Soon
however, the northwest aspect with dry forest was again regained.
 The canopy here consisted of White Pine,Black Birch, Chestnut Oak, Northern Red Oak and Black Locust. American Chestnut sprouts, Striped Maple,
Witch Hazel and Catawba Rhododendron
formed understory and shrub layers. An
opening on a rocky slope was host to Mountain Laurel, Minnie-bush and Corymed
Spiraea (<i>Spiraea betulafolia</i>), with
a ground cover of Bowman's Root (<i>Gillenia
trifoliata</i>) Fly Poison (<i>Amianthium muscaetoxicum</i>), Wild Sarsaparilla, Wood Tickseed (<i>Coreopsis major</i>), Whorled Loosestrife, Four-leaved Yam, White Wood Aster, an Alumroot (<i>Heuchera</i> sp.), Wild
Lily-of-the Valley (<i>Convallaria montana</i>), Marginal Shield Fern, Rock
Fern and a lush cover of mosses. From
this dry, sunny slope, now in late afternoon, we could hear the roar of the
not-too-distant stream ahead, and from the same direction, the calls of Wood
Thrushes (<i>Hylocichla </i> mustelina).<p> Beyond this slope the trail climbs slowly and the forest continues dry and ericaceous with
much Chestnut Oak and Laurel. Downy
Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>), Galax (<i>Galax aphylla</i>) and
Black Gum make their first appearances. A few small Hemlock scattered along the slope show only a little
evidence of the Adelgid. Soon we reach
the stream that has been sounding for so long. Here the forest is again mesic and open and the stream almost smothered
in rank shrubs, vines and herbs which include Mountain Maple (<i>Acer spicatum</i>), an unidentified grape (<i>Vitis</i> sp), Dutchman's Pipe vine, Wood
Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>) and Horse Balm among many other
species. A giant Northern Red Oak
dominated the scene. </ul>
<h2>Discussion</h2><ul>
 <p> A consequence of high mineral nutrient content of the
 country rock here is floral diversity comparable to limestone regions. A number of species (Black Walnut,
Hackberry, Coralberry, Lopseed) that attain their best development in the
latter and are quite demanding of soils, also do well here. The ninety or more species recorded during
this brief survey indicate that such inventories conducted throughout the
growing season would at least double this number in vascular plants alone. The observed diversity is also a consequence
of the ample precipitation that characterizes the northern Blue Ridge and the
moderate elevations traversed. Only a
few plants &mdash; Wild Sarsaparilla, Mountain Holly, Striped Maple and Mountain
Maple&mdash;are truly cold climate species and reflect the modest elevational
differences in the area. However their
occurrence at the observed elevations may in part be a consequence of aspect
and moisture availability.<p> Abrams et al (1997) studied two stands of old
growth forest on Thunder Ridge not far from our inventory sites and which
complement our inventories. One stand, dominated by Chestnut Oak, lay on a
steep south-facing slope a little above 2574 feet (792 m) asl, while the
other, more mesic, with Northern Red Oak dominant, occupied a gently rolling ridge top with a northern
aspect a little above 3367 feet (1036 m). Associates in the Chestnut Oak
stand were Northern Red Oak, Red Maple, the pignut <i>Carya glabra</i>, Black Gum (<i>Nyssa sylvatica</i>) and minor Black Cherry,
Black Birch,
 Sassafras, White Ash and Striped Maple. The stand dominated by
 Northern Red Oak was quite diverse, with White Ash, Black Cherry, Black Birch,
 Yellow Birch (<i>Betula alleganiensis)</i>, Sugar Maple (<i>Acer saccharum</i>), Red Maple, American Basswood, Cucumbertree, Canada Hemlock, Bitternut
Hickory, the pignut hickory <i>Carya glabra</i>, Mockernut Hickory (<i>Carya tomentosa</i>), Black Locust, White Oak (<i>Quercus alba</i>), Striped Maple, American Chestnut
sprouts, Hophornbeam and Witch Hazel. It seems likely to this reporter that the
absence of Chestnut Oak in this stand is a consequence of its high elevation
and northern aspect (Stephenson <i>et al</i>, 1993), since it is near this
species' commonly observed elevational limit. According to the authors&quot;The specific objectives of this study were to characterize the
composition, size and age structure, successional development, and tree ring chronologies spanning a 300-year
period in the contrasting old-growth <i>Quercus</i> forests.&quot; It was found
that the history of the <i>Q. rubra</i> stand was complex, with apparent replacement of this dominant species inrecent years by other mesic species, probably as a consequence of fire
suppression. In contrast the xeric <i>Q. prinus</i> stand had only a small component of potential oak replacement
species and appeared to represent a climax forest on the site on which it
occurred. In any case, it was further concluded by the authors that topography
and substrate &mdash; the latter termed an: &quot;edaphic'&quot; characteristic by
them&mdash;formed the basis for the contrasting dendroecology and successional
development of the two sites. Thus, although excellent studies, such as are
exemplified by this one, can reveal much about stand history, they ultimately
also confirm fundamental stability relations that are independent of this
history (Mueller, 2000).<p> An additional point of interest here is the presence
of this mesic, moisture dependant
Northern Red Oak stand on a ridge top. This phenomenon, which, in the
experience of this reporter, is common in the Central Appalachians, is in
conflict with the common practice of automatically assigning low topographic moisture indexes to such
ridge tops. Low moisture is possible on such ridge tops only if run-off or internal drainage is rapid. The presence
of abundant moisture on many ridge tops
may be seen as a consequence of quite deep, absorbent soils there as a result of favorable geology, and slopes so small that run-off is slow.. Where
soils are shallow, slopes steep and rocky, and rock outcrops common, as in the
case of the <i>Q. prinus </i> stand, neither moisture nor nutrients can
accumulate and a xeric oligotropic flora results. </ul>
