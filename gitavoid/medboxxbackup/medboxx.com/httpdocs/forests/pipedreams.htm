<h1>Of Pipedreams, Science and the Wilderness</h1>

<p> They've
done it again! The technocrats have a new plan to reprogram our world. Consider
the age-old dream of our species, the dream of control over nature without any
drawbacks. Well, they think they finally have it and it's called
&quot;nanotechnology.&quot; This was revealed in an interview of MIT zealots on
National Public Radio on June 24 of this year. The prefix &quot;nano&quot;
means &quot;very small&quot; and in this case refers to ordering manipulations
on the atomic scale. They're not just talking about the natural and spontaneous
ordering or disordering of atoms in crystals as a response to temperature and
pressure changes (a field in which I once did research) and which has
numerous scientific and technological applications in its own right. What they
mean is the deliberate multiscale ordering of the world from atoms on up! But
there is a catch, the same catch that has plagued all technological
megaprojects, yet is almost never mentioned. The catch is that to achieve some
megatechnological result, certain scientific principles must be ignored as
necessarily as others are assiduously applied. It will come as no surprise that
one body of these ignored principles is the science of ecology, but curiously,
another is that brainchild of the industrial revolution itself, classical
thermodynamics. Of course, thermodynamics is not ignored entirely, because no
significance technological device or process can be achieved without taking it
into account. The rub is that our technologically optimistic friends always
stop with the technology as such and don't include the &quot; (read environment) with which the technology necessarily
reacts-environmental thermodynamics if you will. </p>
<p> Environmentalists
are deeply suspicious of science. But whether science is ultimately good or
disastrous for the planet  (and I am strongly tempted
to believe the latter) isn't a useful question here because science appears to
be an inevitable product of a species that the planet is stuck with
temporarily. So we might as well make the best of a bad situation by at least
insuring that critical rules of the game like those of ecology and
thermodynamics aren't disregarded.</p>


<p> Thermodynamics,
as represented by its first and second &quot;laws,&quot; is the science of the
possible and the impossible, a discipline that sets severe limits as well as

serving indispensably in the development of technology. It is also well
grounded in experience, so that we know that no proposed industrial chemical

reaction or physical process for which unfavorable thermodynamic numbers are
obtained is possible, unless it is driven by some external process; and these

external processes are usually prohibitively costly in monetary and
environmental terms. To illustrate, the frequently proposed use of water as a

source of hydrogen chemical fuel would require a fearsome input of energy from
another source, such as nuclear fission, to separate the hydrogen from

oxygen-much more energy would be required than the hydrogen would could ever
yield. </p>


<p> Some will
recall the first law as the rather prosaic statement that energy can't be created

or destroyed as long as its equivalence to mass is recognized. The second law,
which is more mysterious and pertinent to our problem, states that the disorder

or &quot;entropy&quot; of any isolated system always spontaneously increases.
In practical terms this means that although we can create technological order

in local parts of the environment (e.g. an industrial site), there will be
created a concomitant greater quantity of disorder, inevitably not only at that

site, but in external regions from which ordering elements such as energy and
materials are drawn. This is a game that can't be won  (as

I have argued in past articles: <a href=vfw/energy/thermodegrad.htm><cite>Thermodynamics of Environmental Degradation</cite>,
NASA document X-644-71-121</a>; <cite>Science 196</cite>, 261, etc.). Similar conclusions

were reached by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen with respect to economics  (<cite><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Entropy-Law-Economic/dp/1583486003 target=entrop>The Entropy Law and the Economic Process</a></cite>,

Cambridge, MA., 1971 and other publications). However, the whole topic of
environmental thermodynamics has been shunned by the technocrats because they

consider it a &quot;Bad News Science.&quot; From this we can infer that
thermodynamics can be as powerful an ally for us as is ecology. It is, in fact,

the purely physical basis for the so-called &quot;laws of ecology&quot; and is
equally applicable to every aspect of society in which energy is involved.</p>


<p> In a not
too remote tomorrow the dreamers of nanotechnology
  would attempt to order large segments
of our world from the atomic level on up, to create unprecedented control of

chemical, mechanical and biologic systems by fitting every individual atom into
a pre-designated framework to achieve a technological paradise. To get a feel

for the magnitude of such a program consider our everyday experiences, in which
the same thermodynamic forces are at work. We all know how difficult it is to

order our lives, simply to keep our dwellings neat, our personal effects in
place. Note that we're talking here of our familiar macroscopic world. Imagine

then trying to reduce the underlying microscopic world, vibrant and nascent, to
this same brand of preconceived anthropocentric order!</p>


<p> We've seen
that by the second law every ordered region we create calls into being an even

greater region of disorder 
as a result of  the

increased energy flux. In environmental terms this technological energy, no matter
how benign its origin, is synonymous with pollution. Even the most advanced

microelectronic and solar energy systems, which were once regarded as
&quot;pollution free&quot;, are subject to the same energy degradation as are

the crudest factories and mines, except the degradation may take different
forms  (Mueller, <i>Environmental Action 10</i>,15,

1978). If then, by any chance-and this chance is small-the technocrats were
able to order our entire planetary surface to create the wonder world of their

dreams, the energy required and the resulting pollution might well be enough to
disorder much of the solar system!</p>


<p> I won't
tire you with the familiar and dreary litany of technological failures-all of

them touted as examples of our &quot;control&quot; over nature-that are
devastating this beautiful planet. However, it's useful to note in passing a

few familiar cases that may not strike everyone as offensive. Consider current
attempts at supercontrol in the medical profession in which ever more

&quot;sophisticated technologies&quot; such as organ transplants and complex
life support systems, are being developed. Then be aware that burgeoning

material requirements and costs of these technologies are driving up the costs
of ordinary health care beyond the range of those people (externals!) who will never need the new technology. Or consider the
practice of &quot;advanced societies&quot;, and particularly the  US, of
keeping thousands of square miles of terrain in a technological straight jacket

at enormous cost in labor, energy and materials. This applies not only to the
monotonous monocultures of agribusiness, but particularly to the trimmed,

herbicide and pesticide saturated yards, roadsides and other artificially
vegetated areas that are being dedicated to nothing more than perverted

esthetic ideal willed to us by English Lords. Add to these the inefficient
estates of hobby agriculture that destructively enslave more thousands of

square miles (Mueller, <i>EF!,</i> Litha, 1986) as well as the large expanses
of public land devoted to deficit timber, grazing and mining operations by the

federal government. Finally, wonder that even the most nature-alienated MIT
technocrat, confronted seasonally by his own crabgrass, could

consider nanotecnology seriously.</p>


<p> What we
have here is luxury feeding on necessity, the long term consequences of which
may be illustrated,  according to Georgescu-Roegen, by

the production of Cadillacs which will inevitably preclude the availability of
plowshares to future generations (<i>Southern Economic Journal 41</i>, 347,

1975). </p>


<p> All this
allows us to see wilderness in a new light. Wilderness, it appears, is the
manifestation of harmony between order and disorder, both of which are

necessary to maintain it.  (Perhaps it is also
nature's paradigm for the resolution of the contradiction between order and

anarchy so frequently discussed in this journal!) The natural dispersal of
seeds, for example, is a disordering process, as is the chemical diffusion of

nutrients  (positive change of entropy on mixing), 
but there is no better example of order than the adaptive survival of seedlings

in specific sites. In this scheme without a schemer, 
the life order created spontaneously through evolution as a response to

geologic conditions and the solar flux is always exceeded by the sum of the
disordering effects of decay, heat dissipation etc.; and it is this surplus

disorder which drives the entire process. Part of this spontaneously expressed
scheme, which is inherent in the chemistry of the system, is the enormous

biologic diversity, the place-identity mosaic, which confers stability to the
biosphere. However, this stability is threatened when any species becomes

dominant and attempts to exert its own form of order, 
usurping the environmental mosaic and decreasing diversity. In the case of our

species, this usurpation, acting through both excessive numbers and high energy
technology, creates disorder of the type which clashes with natural order.

Consequently the interaction of technology and nature is only a vulgar parody
of the pre-existing harmony.</p>


<p> It is obvious
that pure wilderness terrain requires no inputs of technological energy or

materials to maintain it. Using an analogy from physics, wilderness may be
regarded as an energy &quot;ground state.&quot; The technological energy

required to deviate greatly from this state, even to accommodate existing human
numbers under minimal living standards, let alone the flaunting of luxury,

places in peril our long term survival and that of all other species.</p>


<p> Modern
cities and agriculture necessarily displaced wilderness to accommodate the
needs of excess population. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that
large tracts of wilderness-larger tan those presently existing-are themselves
more necessary than ever as reservoirs of environmental amenities needed to
support civilization's artifacts.</p>


<p> The
foregoing is one of a number of possible &quot;scientific&quot; interpretations
of the planetary dilemma, although one that is unlikely to be embraced by the
scientific establishment with its demands for upbeat predictions of the conquest
of nature. But, at best, science is only one facet of the real world-which is
certainly mystical and poetic at its core. Yet, given the inevitability of its
presence in our lives, our efforts must be directed toward elevating science to
a new analytical level, to a systems approach that recognizes the great
panorama of biology, the limits set by thermodynamics, and above all, the unity
and parity of all life forms. At present wilderness is still regarded as
basically inhospitable to the human intellect, the great chaos out of which we
are elevating ourselves to unlimited heights of technological grandeur.
Contrarily, central to the new level of scientific consciousness is the
recognition of the wilderness source of our intellect and the continuing dependence
of our intellect on wilderness, a dependency that all our high energy ordering
schemes, our gleaming space ships, cannot supplant. Finally, the new scientific
consciousness also recognizes that wilderness is the life-sustaining
environment. </p>


<p> At this new
level we give up the old pipedream of technological control over nature and see
that what we now think of as control is only interaction and impact, and that
for each impact we direct at nature we are impacted in return. Only by
accepting as our standard of reference the natural regimen of harmony between
order and disorder-as best represented by the wilderness-can catastrophe be avoided.</p>
