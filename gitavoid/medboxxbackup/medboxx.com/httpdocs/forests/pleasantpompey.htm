<h1>Mount Pleasant and Pompey Trails</h1>
<p><b>Amherst County, Virginia</b><br>
<i>April 2000</i>

<p>


<p><b>Source Walks: 5-18-99 and 5-30-99</b>
 
 



<p> 
The terrain here is underlain by coarse-grained
granitic and charnockitic gneisses that are fairly massive in character. These
rocks are well exposed in stream valleys and particularly on high ridges and
summits. However, weathering is quite deep and there are substantial colluvial
deposits.
<p> Elevations range from near 3200 feet  (976 m) at the
lowest trail elevations to 3520 feet  (1074 m) at Hog Camp Gap, 3430 feet (1046 m)  at the Trailhead and 4021 feet  (1226 m)  and 4032 feet  (1230 m) 
respectively at the Mt Pleasant and Mt Pompey summits .
<p> One may make a loop of these trails by, for example,
first taking the high ridge trail to Mt Pompey, then continuing on to the base
of Mt Pleasant, with a spur to the summit, and finally by completing the loop
along the lower elevation trail to the point of origin at Hog Camp Gap.
<p> Here we report first on a traverse along the lower
elevation trail to the Mt Pleasant summit. Following this we report on the loop
trail as a whole, but with only cursory observations on Mt Pleasant.
<p> Our traverse to Mt Pleasant began at the Hog Camp Gap
Appalachian Trail crossing in mid-morning of 5-18-99 under a heavy overcast
that lasted all day. Temperatures were comfortable. The first section extended
along the road from the Appalachian Trail to the Trailhead. It consisted of the
acidic up-slope road bank and the  (apparently)  less acidic down-slope bank
that may have been influenced to a degree by road gravel. In many places the
up-slope bank vegetation consisted largely of extensive and thick mats of
haircap (<i>Polytrichum</i>) mosses,
including some <i>Polytrichum juniperinum</i>. as well as other members of
the genus. These mats were overshadowed in part by a sapling canopy dominated
by Black Birch and with lesser amounts of Red Maple, Northern Red Oak, Shagbark
Hickory, White, Virginia and Pitch Pines, Black Cherry, Mountain Ash (<i>Sorbus 
americana</i>),  Striped Maple (<i>Acer</i> <i>pensylvanicum</i>
) and scattered Adelgid-free Canada Hemlock. Scattered throughout the bank were
Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>),  Pennsylvania Blackberry (<i>Rubus 
pensilvanicus</i>),  Smooth Gooseberry (<i>Ribes rotundifolium</i>) and
Upland Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i>) in bloom. Accompanying the <i>Polytrichum</i> were <i>Leucobryum </i> (likely <i>L. glaucum</i>) moss and various species of <i>Cladina</i> 
and other lichens, Noted on the down-slope were large, vigorous Mountain
Holly (<i>Ilex montana</i>),  Smooth Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier laevis</i>) laden
with green fruit, Coralberry (<i>Symphoricarpos
 orbiculatus
</i>), White-haired Panic Grass (<i>Panicum villosissimum</i>),  Variable Panic Grass (<i>P. 
commutatum</i>) and a little Columbine (<i>Aquilegia canadensis</i>) .
<p>Other herbs noted on the
up-slope were Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria pubera</i>),  Arrow-leaf Violet (<i>Viola 
sagittifolia</i>) and Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>) . A Catbird (<i>Dumetella 
crolinensis</i>) and an American Redstart (<i>Setophaga ruticilla</i>) were
seen.
<p> At the Trailhead the lower elevation trail  (an old
logging road)  to Mt Pleasant entered the watershed of the North Fork of the
Buffalo River, with dominantly south-facing aspects. A Towhee (<i>Pipilo 
erythropthalmus</i>) was seen here. 
<p> The canopy, still largely of sapling height, appeared
to be dominated by Northern Red Oak with associated White Ash, Black Locust,
White Pine, Black Birch and a little White Oak. This forest, as distinguished
from that of nearby Cole Mountain, was quite ericaceous with Mountain Laurel,
Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia pilosa</i>) in bloom, and Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis 
virginiana</i>) . <i>Polytrichium</i> moss,  including <i>P. ohioense</i>, was
accompanied by such acidiphile mosses as <i>Hedwigia ciliata</i> 
and Wheat Moss (<i>Diphyscium foliosum</i>) . Mountain Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia 
compressa</i>) was concentrated on the trail. Bracken Fern (<i>Pteridium 
aquilinum</i>) and the Creeping Five-leaf <i>Potentilla canadensis</i> were common herbs. Bird calls were frequent, with Ovenbird (<i>Serius 
aurocapillus</i>) and Veery (<i>Catharus fuscescens</i>) among the most readily
identifiable. Both the song and short &quot;phew&quot; call of the Veery were
frequent.
<p> The ericaceous forest alternated with and/or
contained patches of more mesic, less acidic, types, as next indicated by the
occurrence of Poke Milkweed (<i>Asclepias exaltata</i>),  Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola 
sororia</i>),  a hawkweed, either Panicled (<i>Hieracium paniculatum</i>) or Hairy (<i>H. gronovii</i>),  Tall
Coneflower (<i>Rudbeckia laciniata</i>),  Basil Balm (<i>Monarda 
clinopodia</i>),  Horse Balm (<i>Collinsonia canadensis</i>),  Allegheny Blackberry (<i>Rubus 
allegheniensis</i>),  the moss <i>Platygyrium repens</i>, Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga 
racemosa</i>),  Striped Maple, Maryland Figwort (<i>Scrophularia marilandica</i>
), Bloodroot (<i>Sanquinaria canadensis</i>),  Cucumbertree, abundant
Black Birch, Northern Red Oak and Red Maple. White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>Sitta 
carolinensis</i>) were active in the canopy here.
<p> Again in ericaceous forest, we noted in succession
Pink Ladyslipper (<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>) in bloom, an American Redstart,
Chestnut Oak, White Wood Aster (<i>Aster divaricatus</i>),  a little Spotted
Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila maculata</i>
), large Mountain Laurel, Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa uniflora</i>),  American Chestnut (<i>Castanea 
dentata</i>) sprouts, Entire-leaved Yellow Foxglove (<i>Aureolaria 
laevigata</i>),  a dieased bedstraw, either Lance-leaf Wild Liquorice (<i>Galium 
lanceolatum</i>) or Purple Bedstraw (<i>G. latifolium</i>),  mole
heavings, the call of an Ovenbird,<i>
Carex laxiflora </i>and a little Table Mountain Pine (<i>Pinus pungens</i>) .
<p> Heralded by the call of a Scarlet Tanager (<i>Piranga 
olivacea</i>),  we again entered a more mesic forest with Black Birch,
Black Locust, Black Cherry, Hay-scented Fern, Palmate-leaf Violet (<i>Viola 
palmata</i>),  Cut-leaf Toothwort (<i>Dentaria laciniata</i>),  Indian Turnip (<i>Arisaema 
triphillum</i>),  Large-flowered Trillium (<i>Trillium grandiflorum</i>) in
bloom and Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia perfoliata
</i>), also in bloom.
<p> Soon we also noted Sugar Maple, Shagbark Hickory,
Allegheny Blackberry, more Red Maple, Black Cherry, <i>Carex gracilescens</i> and Enchanted Nightshade (<i>Circaea 
qudrisulcata</i>) . A little farther on Sugar Maple became very abundant
in association with Black Cherry, Tall Bellflower (<i>Capanula americana</i>),  Allegheny Crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus 
allegheniensis</i>),  Rattlesnake Fern (<i>Botrychium virginianum</i>), 
Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>),  Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i>),  White Ash, Carrion Flower (<i>Smilax 
herbacea</i>),  Dutchman's Pipe vine (<i>Aristolochia macrophylla</i>) 
and the forest grass<i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>. Progressively the canopy came
to consist of almost pure Sugar Maple with Virginia Waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum</i>) and blooming Mealy Bellwort conspicuous in the
ground cover.
<p> Passing out of these groves we were attracted by a
single tall, straight Bigtooth Aspen (<i>
Populus grandidentata</i>),  heard
again the call of an Ovenbird, saw Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana</i>) and a
Clintonia,  likely White (<i>Clintonia umbellulata</i>) . Here as elsewhere a moss
of the genus <i>Dicranella </i>was a common soil cover along the trail.
<p> We now arrived at a shallow ravine with an active
stream or springbrook. Here was the first Yellow Birch in association with Lady
Fern (<i>Athyrium filix-femina</i>),  <i>Carex stipata</i>, Turtlehead (<i>Chelone 
glabra</i>),  Tall Coneflower, Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>) and a
jewelweed (<i>Impatiens </i> sp) . A Scarlet Tanager called nearby. Not
far beyond the trail crossed another springbrook with abundant mosses that
included species of <i>Brachythecium</i> and <i>Mnium</i>.
Here we saw the first Catawba
Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron catawbiense</i>),  <i>Carex scabrata</i> and heard another Ovenbird. Also in the area
were a large White Oak, Cucumbertree, abundant Striped Maple, Yellow Birch and
some Basswood, likely American (<i>
Tilia americana</i>) . In the vicinity
of yet another springbrook crossed by the trail were Blue Monkshood (<i>Aconitum uncinatum</i>),  Wood
Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>),  Filmy Angelica (<i>Angelica 
triquinata</i>) and Maryland Figwort.
<p> Now at an elevation of perhaps 3200 feet  (976 m), 
after a long descent, we began again to climb. First noted were scattered
Mountain Laurel, American Chestnut sprouts and down boles, Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia 
nudicaulis</i>) and Minnie-bush. The moisture-rich if somewhat acidic
character of this forest was signalled by the presence of <i>Medeola</i>, the first Bunch Flower (<i>Veratrum</i> <i>parviflorum</i>),  the meadow parsnip <i>Thaspium 
pinnatifidum</i>, Silvery Glade Fern (<i>Athyrium thelypterioides</i>), 
White Baneberry (<i>Actaea pachypoda</i>),  Large-flowered Trillium, <i>Carex 
laxiflora</i>, Dwarf Spiraea (<i>Spiraea betulifolia</i>) and the first Rose Azalea
(<i>Rhododendron roseum</i>),  with strongly aromatic blossoms.
<p> Next encountered was some Black Bear (<i>Ursus 
americanus</i>) scat, black in color, entirely vegetarian, and with the
appearance still of Cow Parsnip (<i>Heracleum maximum</i> 
or <i> H. lanatum</i>) . Noted
also here was blooming Fly Poison (<i>Amianthium muscaetoxicum</i>),  the abundance of
umbilicate lichens on rocks, <i>Carex communis 
</i>and the call of a Veery.
<p> We now came to a rocky exposed slope on which we saw
our first Black Huckleberry (<i>
Gaylussacia baccata</i>) in
association with Upland Low Blueberry, Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>), 
Wild Liveforever (<i>Sedum telephioides</i>),  Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium 
virginianum</i>) and Whorled Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia quadrifolia</i>), 
all under Chestnut Oak. Several noisy and active Hairy Woodpeckers (<i>Picoides 
villosus</i>) attracted our attention here.
<p> A little farther along the trail we saw Starry
Campion (<i>Silene stellata</i>),  then the feather remains of
a killed and consumed Junco (<i>Junco hyemalis</i>) on a down bole, while a live
Junco, perhaps its mate, was observed nearby.
<p> Continuing our climb, we arrived at some large  (2
ft/0.6 m)  Shagbark Hickories with associated Broad Beech Fern (<i>Phegopteris 
hexagonoptera</i>),  Carolina Lily (<i>Lilium michauxii</i>) and Blue Cohosh, then the
first Yellow Birch on a distinct slope, with more large Shagbark, the first Red
Elderberry (<i>Sambucus pubens</i>),  Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum 
canadense</i>) in bloom and Mountain Holly. These were followed by
abundant Clintonia of unidentified species, more Canada Mayflower, and the song
of a Rose-breasted Grossbeak (<i>Pheucticus ludovicianus</i>) . Here we also saw the
only occurrence observed by us of the northern and likely disjunct<i>Carex 
brunnescens</i>, growing as usual for the this sedge,on a rock.
<p> The trail now took a sharp turn to the right, passing
by Northern Red Oak, Shagbark Hickory, Black Birch, American Chestnut sprouts,
Mountain Holly and Hay-scented Fern, and we again heard the call of an
Ovenbird. Not much farther along we noted the first living Cow Parsnip, perhaps
the site of the Bear's meal. In places however, <i>Carex pensylvanica </i>dominated the ground cover. A Veery
called as we approached Choke Cherry (<i>Prunus virginiana</i>) and the hawthorn <i>Crataegus 
flabellata </i>, both in bloom.
<p> At the saddle between Mount Pompey and Mt Pleasant
the canopy cosisted of large &quot;orchard&quot; Northern Red Oak and smaller
Yellow Birch with an understory of Witch Hazel and blooming Alternate-leaf
Dogwood (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i>
). Stunted Wild Geranium was also in bloom. Here we again heard a Scarlet
Tanager and came to a sign that indicated 0.5 mile  (0.8 km)  to the Mt
Pleasant summit.
<p> We now began to climb the relatively steep slope to
the Mt Pleasant summit in a series of switchbacks. Under a canopy of
wind-blasted Northern Red Oak and scattered taller Shagbark Hickory, Catawba
Rhododendron and large Witch Hazel were dominant shrubs and Canada Mayflower
and Yellow Clintonia (<i>Clintonia borealis</i>) ground cover. Also
conspicuous were Mountain Ash, Yellow Birch, Hay-scented Fern, Mountain Laurel
and blooming Rose Azalea.
<p> On the summit we noted a broken canopy of stunted and
contorted Northern Red Oak, smaller Yellow Birch, Black Cherry and Shagbark Hickory.
Small trees were Mountain Ash, Smooth Serviceberry and the hawthorn <i>Crataegus 
flabellata </i>in bloom. A
diverse shrub layer included abundant Witch Hazel, Choke Cherry coming into
bloom, common Catawba Rhododendron, scattered Chokeberry (<i>Aronia melanocarpa</i>),  Dwarf
Spiraea, Beaked Hazelnut (<i>Corylus cornuta</i>),  Smooth Gooseberry, also in
bloom, Minnie-bush, fragrantly-blooming Rose Azalea, a very little Bush
Honeysuckle (<i>Diervilla lonicera</i>
), Deer Berry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i>) and, on exposed rock, Low
Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier spicata</i>) just coming into bloom. Both
Common and Hispid Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i> and <i>S. hispida</i>) were seen.
<p> Abundant in the ground flora were blooming Canada
Mayflower and Yellow Clintonia. Other herbs were Large-flowered Trillium, also
in bloom, stunted Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>),  Carolina Lily, an
unidentified Lily (<i>Lilium</i> sp),  blooming Great Chickweed, a little
Virginia Waterleaf, Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii</i>),  Bootts Goldenrod (<i>S. 
boottii</i>),  an unidentified Goldenrod (<i>S.</i> sp),  Mountain Aster (<i>Aster 
acuminatus</i>),  Big-leaf Aster (<i>A</i>. <i>macrophyllus</i>
), a hawkweed, either <i>Hieracium paniculatum</i> or <i>H. gronovii</i>, Wild Liveforever, Filmy
Angelica, the meadow parsnip <i>Thaspium</i> <i>pinnatifidum,</i>
Cow Parsnip, Fly Poison lacking flower buds, Bunch Flower, Starry Campion, Wood
Anemone,, <i>Carex pensylvanica </i>and Lady
Fern. Mountain Spleenwort (<i>
Asplenium montanum</i>),  Rock Fern and
Silver Whitlo-wort (<i>Paronychia argyrocoma</i>) occurred on exposed rock
surfaces, while Michaux's Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga michauxii</i>) occupied areas immediately
beneath the large summit rocks. Also present in rock crevices were unidentified
sedges and a rush.
<p> As our visit to the Mount Pleasant summit was brief,
we could not survey all of it. Consequently we may have missed some rare
species. An example is Mountain Sandwort (<i>Arenaria groenlandica</i>),  which has been reported
to occur there  (Chuck Bailey, personal communication, 1990) .
<p>&nbsp;
<p> Some bryophytes and a lichen were identified by R.
Hunsucker from collections made on this traverse. In the following list the

<br>&nbsp;
<p> Our traverse of 5-30-99 began with a brief survey
again of the vegetation, including the <i>Polytrichum</i>
mats  (see our walk of 5-18-99),  between the Applachian Trail crossing and the
Mt Pompey trailhead. Noted here were the calls of a Scarlet Tanager and a
Black-billed Cuckoo (<i>Coccyzus erythropthalmus
</i>) and, for the first time, Common Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium</i> <i>clavatum</i>) . Also seen was a
Chestnut-sided Warbler (<i>Dendroica pensylvanica</i>),  a species adapted to the
young forest here.
<p> At the trailhead we began our ascent of the ridge
line that separates the Piny River watershed from that of the Buffalo River to
the south. Successively noted along the lower slope were blooming
Small-flowered Phacelia (<i>Phacelia dubia</i>),  Hay-scented Fern, blooming
Catawba Rhododendron, Northern Red Oak, Black Birch, Mountain Laurel,
Minnie-bush, also in bloom, Red Maple, Whorled Loosestrife, a species of the
mint <i>Stachys</i> and Upland Low Blueberry. Here we again
heard a Black-billed Cuckoo, a Scarlet Tanager and an unidentified warbler.
<p> We then climbed through abundant Hay-scented Fern,
hearing an Ovenbird, past Mountain Holly, Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium 
purpureum</i>),  Wild Sarsaparilla, blooming Allegheny Blackberry, the
forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i> 
and Bracken Fern. Following these we saw Mealy Bellwort, Common Many
Knees (<i>Polgonatum biflorum</i>) and Squaw Root (<i>Conopholis 
americana</i>),  then in a dryer section, Dwarf Spiraea, the uncommon
grass <i>Calamagrostis porteri</i> 
and Rose Azalea in bloom
<p> Entering again a more mesic area we saw Poke
Milkweed, Virginia Waterleaf, Black Cherry, White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium 
rugosum</i>),  Slender Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis filipes</i>),  Hog
Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata</i>),  Downy Wood Violet in bloom,
very vigorous although not blooming Palmate-leaf Violet (<i>Viola palmata</i>) and
Columbine, also not in bloom. Heard here was the song of a Rose-breasted
Grossbeak and the short call of a Veery. Succeeding these were Carex pensylvanica, Large-flowered Trillium with
its petals turned pink with age, then the first Yellow Birch of the traverse
and the call of an Indigo Bunting (<i>Passerina cyanea</i>) .
<p> Now, on a diminished slope, we approached the summit
of the ridge at near 3800 feet  (1159 m)  asl. Here, under an open canopy,was
tall  (5 ft/2.5 m)  and still not fully unfolded Bracken Fern,in the most
luxuriant stand of this fern ever seen by this observer. Nearby was more tall
vegetation consisting of Allegheny Blackberry, Virgin's Bower (<i>Clematis 
virginiana</i>) and Poke Milkweed. Shorter plants included Mealy
Bellwort and Wild Geranium, all under vigorous Northern Red Oak saplings.
Mountain Oat Grass formed a dense growth on the trail.
<p> We now moved down-slope, seeing more Mealy Bellwort,
abundant Striped Maple and Horse Balm,then Veiny Peavine (<i>Lathyrus venosus</i>) in lush
growth. Here we heard a Red-eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>),  followed by more
Hay-scented Fern, large, beautiful Shagbark Hickory, Northern Red Oak, Red
Maple and some Yellow Birch. Here we also saw the first Bunch Flower of the
traverse, with Tall Coneflower, Virginia Waterleaf, Hispid Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus 
hispidus</i>) and abundant Lady Fern.
<p> On a small elevation and associated with a rock
outcrop we saw the only Large-flowered Bellwort (<i>Uvularia grandiflora</i>) of
either traverse. while not in bloom, this plant was here closely associated
with blooming Mealy Bellwort, <i>Thaspium pinnatifidum</i> and Wild Geranium, while nearby stood tall, luxuriant Bracken
Fern. Not far beyond this occurrence we were attracted by a large dung or
carrion type beetle, with a bright yellow pronotum, feeding on dung in the
trail.
<p> The vegetation on the slope below was also
rich-appearing, with dense stands of tall herbs and shrubs under an open canopy
of Shagbark Hickory and Black Cherry. Represented were the first-noted Cow
Parsnip of the traverse, Black Cohosh, Tall Coneflower, Horse Balm, Arrow-leaf
Aster (<i>Aster sagittifolius</i>
) and Allegheny Blackberry. Both seen and heard were a Catbird and a Chestnut-sided Warbler .
<p> After passing through a saddle at 3600 feet  (1098 m
) asl, we began to climb the northwest spur of Mount Pompey. The canopy here
was dominated by Northern Red Oak, but there was a little White Oak as well.
Blooming Catawba Rhododendron was conspicuous, as was Canada Mayflower in the
ground cover. As we clinbed we saw Minnie-bush, Rose Azalea and Wood Betony (<i>Pedicularis 
canadensis</i>),  all in bloom. A little higher we tallied Mountain
Laurel, Red Maple, <i>Medeola</i>, a little
Round-leaf Pyrola (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia
</i>), Witch Hazel, Black Birch, Wild Sarsaparilla and Pink Ladyslipper in
bloom.
<p> Now climbing quite steeply among abundant Striped
Maple, we passed over a thick carpet of Canada Mayflower with Black Chokeberry,
Whorled Loosestrife and White clintonia, all in bloom. Here also were quite
large White Oak, abundant Black Birch and a large colony of Pink Ladyslipper in
spectacular bloom. A common trail grass on this slope was Red Fescue(<i>Festuca 
rubra</i>) .
<p> Soon, at perhaps 3800 feet  (1159 m)  asl, the slope
became less steep under a canopy of Northern Red Oak, Black Birch and
apparently healthy Canada Hemlock, with
abundant sprouts of American Chestnut. This was an open forest with a ground
cover dominated by <i>Carex pensylvanica</i>, with Hay-scented Fern. Few
ericacaea were present, and large rock outcrops bore various umbilicate
lichens, including, apparently,<i>
Lasallia papulosa</i> . Other species
here were Witch Hazel, Mountain Holly, large patches of ferns, including
particularly very vigorous Lady Fern with Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda claytoniana</i>),  and
nearby, Curtis Goldenrod and Mountain Aster.
<p>A little higher still we saw
a Cucumbertree, a Mountain Maple (<i>
Acer spicatum</i>),  Intermediate
Shield Fern with exceptionally narrow fronds,  then more Fly Poison, with <i>Carex 
rosea</i>, Hispid Greenbrier and continued abundance of Canada
Mayflower.
<p> The summit of Mt Pompey was characterized by an open
canopy of large gnarled Northern Red Oak and smaller Yellow Birch with American
Chestnut sprouts. American Hazelnut (<i>Corylus americana</i>) was present here, as
distinguished from the Beaked Hazelnut we observed on Mt Pleasant. As below,
Rose Azalea was in bloom and accompanied by Mountain Holly, Smooth Gooseberry,
Hay-scented Fern and vaious unidentified sedges.
<p> Our descent from Mt Pompey was along a south-trending
spur crest under a canopy of &quot;orchard&quot;- form Northern Red Oak with
Shagbark Hickory. We also saw at least one skinny Bitternut Hickory (<i>Carya 
cordiformis</i>) . Allegheny Blackberry in full bloom formed a dense
shrub layer under open crowns. Only a single bird, a Wood Pewee (<i>Contopus 
virens</i>) was heard during our descent. On reaching the saddle
between Mounts Pompey and Pleasant  (see our 5-18-99 inventory)  we added Black
Huckleberry and Mountain Ash to our tally there.
<p> Although no further systematic inventory was
conducted on the Mt Pleasant slope or summit this day,  a rapid reconnaissance
by members of our party revealed Yellow Clintonia in bloom there and an
occurrence of a blooming Yellow Ladyslipper (<i>Cypripedium</i> sp)  as well. 
<p> Our return to the trailhead was via the lower
elevation trail we had followed to Mt Pleasant on 5-18-99, thus completing the
loop. On crossing the springbrooks reported on at that time, we noted greatly
diminished flow. Seen on this trail for the first time was Mountain Maple and
the presence of White Clintonia was confirmed by seeing the plant in bloom.
<p> A tally of identifiable bird calls and/or
observations was kept on the return traverse of perhaps two miles  (3.2 km) .
This tally, done with an attempt to exclude repeat birds, was as follows:
<p>&nbsp;
<p> Veery - Rose-breasted Grossbeak - Scarlet Tanager -
Ovenbird - Scarlet Tanager - Scarlet
Tanager - Veery - Red-eyed Vireo - Ovenbird - Ovenbird
- Veery - a vireo - Ovenbird - Scarlet Tanager - Red-eyed Vireo
<p> 
<p> A remarkable characteristic of the flora seen on
these traverses is the apparent absence or virtual absence of certain plants
that occur widely and frequently in acidic communities in the folded
Appalachians and on the eastern Blue Ridge sandstones and quartzites. These are
Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigaea repens</i>),  Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria 
procumbens</i>), Rattlesnake Weed  (
<i>Hieracium venosum</i>) and Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila 
maculata</i>),  although a little of the last-named was seen on one
traverse. Also of interest is the common occurrence of Coralberry at Hog Camp
Gap, but its apparent absence in the terrain crossed by our traverses here. Are
these mere statistical flukes or do they reflect soil or climatic conditions?
The virtual absence of these species is also characteristic of much of the
Allegheny plateau that combines high precipitation and a cloudy day maximum.
<p> Also of note is the frequency of ericaceous and
generally acidiphile vegetation as compared to that of nearby Cole Mountain,
where virtually none was observed  (see <a href=pedlarwatershed.htm>our section on the Pedlar River
watershed</a>). In this case the similarity of the granitic and charnockitic
gneisses that form the bedrock in both areas may only be apparent. Such implied
differences in bedrock may also be reflected in the patchy occurrence of
acidiphile communities along our traverses to Mounts Pleasant and Pompey.
Finally, the relatively mild montane climate of Cole Mountain, relative to
similar areas in the Alleghenies, as discussed in <a href=pedlarwatershed.htm>our section on the Pedlar
River watershed</a>, is again apparent here in the limited occurrence of Yellow
Birch and, with a few exceptions, other boreal species, even on northern
aspects at high elevation.
