<blockquote>
<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<p>Potts Mountain forms the southern half and Rich Patch
Mountain the northern half of a complex anticlinial structure that extends 35
miles (56 km) southwest from Clifton Forge, Virginia to the West Virginia
line. Like that of Warm Springs
Mountain, this anticline is capped by erosion-resistant Silurian sandstone that
forms the backbone of high ridges (Rader and Evans, 1993) . It is also breached, exposing the same
Ordovician formations that are present in the Warm Springs Valley . While Potts Mtn. has no prominent knobs such
as characterize some other ranges, the main ridge reaches 3800 ft. (1160
meters), and elevation plays a part in determining its biologic communities.
<p>&nbsp;
</ul>
<h2>Potts Creek Flood Plain</h2>
<p><b>Source Walk 5-13-94</b>
<ul>
<p> Potts Creek, a branch of the Jackson River, flows
northeast at the base of the northwest slope of Potts Mountain in a valley
dominated by Devonian shales (Rader
and Gathright, 1986) . At the Steel
Bridge campground of the Jefferson National Forest a quite rich and diverse,
in-part mesophytic forest occupies the bottomland along the stream. This forest, at approximately 1700 ft. (520
meters) elevation, is one of the easternmost outposts of a characteristic
species of the mixed mesophyte forest type, Yellow Buckeye, and provides an
interesting contrast with mesophytic cove forests to the east. The stream is also habitat for the rare
James River Spiny Mussel (<i>Pleurobema
collina</i>) which is listed Endangered under the Endangered Species Act (
Neves, 1991) .
<p> In an inventory of several hours duration in the
vicinity of the campground, 21 canopy tree species, 18 small trees and 31 herbs
were identified. Canopy species
included Canada Hemlock(<i>Tsuga canadensis
</i>)(apparently Adelgid-free), Red and Sugar Maples, White, Chestnut, Scarlet,
Black and Northern Red Oaks, Shagbark and Pignut Hickories, American Basswood,
Yellow Buckeye, White Ash, Black Locust, a little Black Walnut, Tuliptree,
Sassafras, Virginia and White Pines, and along the stream, Black Willow (<i>Salix nigra</i>) and River Birch (<i>Betula nigra</i>). Small trees and shrubs are Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya virginiana</i>), Muscletree (<i>Carpinus caroliniana</i>), Flowering and Alternate-leaved Dogwood (<i>Cornus florida </i>and <i>C.alternifolia</i>), 
Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i>), 
Black Haw, Maple-leaf and Arrowwood Viburnums (<i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>, <i>V.acerifolium </i>and <i>V.dentatum
</i>), Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus</i> sp), 
Fringetree (<i>Chionanthus virginica)</i>,
Buffalonut (<i>Pyrularia pubera</i>),
Leatherwood (<i>Dirca palustris</i>), Great
Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>
), Flame Azalea (<i>R.calendulaceum</i>), 
Deerberry (<i>Vaccinium staminium</i>), 
Upland Low Blueberry (<i>V.pallidum</i>), 
and close to the stream, Smooth Alder (<i>Alnus
serrulata</i>) and Winterberry Holly (<i>
Ilex</i> <i>verticillata</i>) . Very likely this list, particularly with
regard to canopy species, is incomplete. 
For example, White Basswood, a common associate of Yellow Buckeye in
typical mixed mesophyte forest (Braun, 1950), is expected here, as is
Sycamore (<i>Platanus occidentalis</i>), a
tree which is almost a fixture on such streams and may be missed through
over-familiarity and obviousness. (Yes! seen by us on later visits) .
<p> The list of herbaceous plants is doubtless even less
complete. Those identified are as
follows: Wild Stonecrop (<i>Sedum ternatum</i>), Wild Sweet William (<i>Phlox maculata</i>), Lovage (<i>Ligusticum canadense</i>) of which tea was
made, Golden Alexanders (<i>Zizia aptera</i> and <i>Z.
trifoliata</i>), Fringed Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia
ciliata</i>), Flowering Spurge (<i>
Euphorbia corollata</i>), White Wood, Wavy-leaf, Purplestem and Flat-top White
Asters (<i>Aster
divaricatus,A.undulatus,A.puniceus</i> and <i>A.umbellatus
</i>), Robins Plantain (<i>Erigeron pulchellus</i>), Entire-leaved
Yellow Foxglove (<i>Aureolaria lævigata</i>),
Wild Geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>), 
Wood Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>), 
Solomons Seal or &quot;Many Knees&quot; (<i>Polygonatum
biflorum</i>), Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>
Uvularia sessilifolia</i>), Plume Lily (<i>
Smilacina racemosa</i>), Filmy Angelica (<i>Angelica
triquinata</i>), Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum
lanuginosum) </i>, Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla
simplex</i>), the legumes Wild Vetch (<i>Vicia
caroliniana</i>) and Veiny Peavine (<i>Lathyrus
venosus)</i>, the root parasites Squawroot (<i>Conopholis americana</i>) and One-flowered Broomrape (<i>Orobanche uniflora</i>), the grass Nodding
Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>) and the
sedges <i>Carex laxiflora</i> and <i>C.
torta</i>. The last mentioned sedge is
a tough, flood-resistant species that populates stream beds.
<p> 
In terms of chemical environment Hemlock and ericads such as <i>Rhododendron</i> and <i>Vaccinium</i> indicate at least a marginally acid substrate where these
plants occur. However the mollusk fauna
in the stream and widespread occurrence of carbonates in the Devonian country
rock seem to imply a strong counter balance to the prevalent regional acidic
conditions. Doubtless many microhabitats occur and these provide an explanation
for the frequent juxtaposition of greatly contrasting communities .

<h2>Return to Potts Creek</h2>
<p><b>Source Walks: 9-22-96, 10-4-96, 5-10-98, 6-30-99, 9-24-99, 9-25-99 and 9-26-99</b>
 <ul>

<p> All visits reported on here were to the Steel Bridge
Campground and vicinity. The first four were opportunistic occasions that
resulted from use of the campground. That of 10-4-99 was solely concerned with
fungi, while the last three represent systematic inventories of the campground
and vicinity.
<p> The brief inventory of 9-22-96 added the following
species to our tally: Pitch Pine (<i>Pinus rigida</i>), Downy Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier arborea</i>), Sycamore (<i>Platanus occidentalis</i>), Bittersweet (<i>Celastrus 
scandens</i>), American Alumroot (<i>Heuchera americana</i>), Silverrod (<i>Solidago 
bicolor</i>), Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>S. rugosa</i>), Curtis
Goldenrod (<i>S. curtisii</i>), Cut-leaf Goldenrod (<i>S. arguta</i> var <i> arguta</i>), Panicled Hawkweed (<i>Hieracium</i> <i>paniculatum</i>), Dittany
(<i>Cunila 
origanoides</i>), Southern Bellflower (<i>Campanula divaricata</i>), 
Slender-leaved Summer Bluets (<i>Houstonia tenuifolia</i>), Cliff Stonecrop (<i>Sedum 
glaucophylla</i>), Wild Pink (<i>
Silene caroliniana</i>), Creeping
Phlox (<i>Phlox stolonifera</i>), White Vervain (<i>Verbena urticifolia</i>), 
Field Thistle (<i>Cirsium discolor</i>), the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, Blackseed Needlegrass (<i>Stipa avenacea</i>) and Rock
Fern (<i>Polpodium</i> <i>virginianum</i>

<p><i> </i>Our brief over-night visit of 5-10-98 and 5-11-98,
which occurred during cool, rainy weather, added several species as well
phenological observations. Both Pink and Flame Azaleas (<i>Rhododendron nudiflorum </i>and <i>R</i>. <i>calendulaceum</i>
) were in bloom, as was Creeping Phlox. Seen for the first time were Pasture
Rose (<i>Rosa carolina</i>), Spring Bluets (<i>Houstonia caerulea</i>), also
in bloom, Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia perfoliata</i>), abundant Rattlesnake Weed
(<i>Hieracium venosum</i>), Lance-leaf Wild Liquorice (<i>Galium lanceolatum</i>) and
the alien Canada Bluegrass (<i>Poa compressa</i>) . Birds included Scarlet
Tanager (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>), Ovenbird (<i>Seiurus 
aurocapillus</i>), Red-eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo</i> <i>olivaceus</i>
) and Great Crested Flycatcher (<i>Myiarchus crinitus</i>) . A moderately large
unidentified frog (<i>Rana </i> sp) was seen crossing the road during the
rainy night. Also observed were two types of beetles on a dead Possum (<i>Didelphis 
marsupialis</i>) . One of these was a half-inch (1.2 cm) - broad
carrion beetle (Silphidae) and the other a very active rove beetle (Staphyllinidae
).
<p> Our 6-30-99 inventory was conducted in the vicinity
of the campground's northeast end. Dominating the canopy here were White,
Northern Red, Black and Scarlet Oaks, with the pignut hickory <i>Carya 
glabra</i>, Red and Sugar Maples, White Pine, White Ash, Biltmore Ash (
A variety of White Ash), Black Cherry, Black Gum, Tuliptree, Sassafras and
Virginia Pine. Understory species were Downy Serviceberry, Flowering Dogwood
and Hophornbeam. Shrubs included Black Haw and Maple-leaf Viburnums, Wild
Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea arborescens</i>), Buffalonut, Pasture Rose,
Deer Berry, Upland Low Blueberry with ripe fruit and St. Andrews Cross (<i>Hypericum</i> <i>hypericoides</i>), while
Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>), Saw Brier (<i>S. 
glauca</i>), Summer Grape (<i>Vitis aestivalis</i>), Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</i>) and Poison Ivy (<i>Rhus radicans</i>) were vines.
A few seedlings of Redbud (<i>Cercis canadensis</i>), Virginia Juniper (<i>Juniperus virginianum</i>) and Yellow
Buckeye were also present. 
<p> Herbs successively noted were Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea 
quaternata</i>), Downy rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens</i>), the
panic grass <i>Panicum boscii</i>, a fleabane (<i>Erigeron</i> sp), Plume Lily,
Canada Bluegrass, Wavy-leaf Aster, an abundant sedge,likely <i>Carex 
pensylvanica</i>, Curtis Goldenrod with a resemblance to Wreath
Goldenrod (<i>Solidago caesia</i>), Ebony Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium 
platyneuron</i>), Canada Brome Grass (<i>Bromus pubescens</i>), American Alumroot in bloom, Common Solomons Seal or
Many Knees, Creeping Five-leaf, a pussytoes (<i>Antennaria</i> sp), Poverty
Oat Grass, the acidiphile tick-trefoil <i>Desmodium nudiflorum</i>, Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria 
pubera</i>), the sedges<i>
Carex complanata </i> var <i>hirsuta</i> 
and <i>C. cephalophora</i>, a wedge grass (<i>Sphenopholis</i> sp), 
Hairy-jointed Meadow Parsnip (<i>Thaspium barbinode</i>
), Nodding Fescue, Long-leaved Summer Bluets (<i>Houstonia longifolia</i>), White Wood Aster, Starry
Campion (<i>Silene stellata</i>), Blunt-lobed Hepatica (<i>Hepatica 
americana</i>) and Squaw Root (<i>Conopholis americana</i>) . Associated mosses included
Delicate Fern Moss, <i>Rhodobryum roseum</i> 
on rock, mounds of haircap (likely <i>Polytrichum ohioense</i>), a false haircap (<i>Atrichum</i> sp) and a species of <i>Leucobryum</i>.
<p> Gray Tree Frogs (<i>Hyla exima </i>/<i>H. versicolor </i> complex) calls were common, as were those of
Wood Thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustelina</i>), Scarlet Tanager, Crow (<i>Corvus 
brachyehynchos</i>) White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>Sitta</i> <i>carolinensis</i>) and Red-eyed Vireo. Of particular interest were the
calls of the Horned Owl (<i>Bubo virginianus</i>) in one of its few
manifestations in these mountains, in which the Barred Owl (<i>Strix 
varia</i>) is usually heard. Also showing themselves were some of <i>Bubo's</i> 
prey animals, the Cottontail Rabbit (<i>Sylvilagus floridanus</i>) and
the Gray Squirrel (<i>Sciurus carolinensis</i>) .
<p> Our September, 1999 visit was favored by ideal
weather, with mostly clear skies, pleasant temperatures and a gradual warming
trend during our stay. Our camp site on this visit was located perhaps 1/4 mile
 (0.4 km) southwest of the northeast end of the campground. Our first
inventory, on 9-24-99, was of the flora in the immediate vicinity of our camp
site, while that of 9-25-99 consisted of a loop traverse to the southwest. Our
final traverse, on 9-26-99, extended along a dissected terrace east of Potts
Creek.
<p> The canopy at our camp site consisted of scattered
large White Pine and more abundant but smaller White Oak, less frequent
Scarlet, Black, Northern Red and Chestnut Oaks, Red Maple, <i>Carya glabra</i>, White and
Biltmore Ashes, Black Cherry, Hemlock, Sassafras and Virginia Pine. Seedlings
of Sugar Maple were also seen. Downy Serviceberry and Fringe Tree were
understory species, and the most common shrub Witch Hazel, with less common
Arrowwood and Black Haw Viburnums, Buffalonut, Mountain Laurel, unidentified
Azaleas (<i>Rhododendron</i> spp), Deer Berry and Upland Low Blueberry.
Common Greenbrier was the most frequently seen vine, but Summer Grape, Virginia
Creeper and Saw Brier were also present. A great variation was observed in the
leaf shape and other characteristics of the Deer Berry.
<p> Herbs recorded were Four-leaved Yam,<i>Potentilla 
simplex</i>, Spotted Wintergreen, Downy Rattlesnake Plantain, Plume
Lily, Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella Repens</i>
), White Wood and Wavy-leaf Asters, a little Stiff Aster (<i>Aster</i> <i>linariifolius</i>) near the Creek, Curtis Goldenrod that resembled
Wreath Goldenrod, Cut-leaf Goldenrod, Silverrod, Slender Goldenrod (<i>Solidago 
erecta</i>) and Entire-leaved Yellow Foxglove in full bloom, as were
all the asters and goldenrods.
<p> Found in the dry upland forest above the Creek were a
few culms of Wood Reed Grass (<i>Cinna arundinacea</i>), a species normally
restricted to moist areas. It is likely that this grass was a metastble remnant
 (Mueller, 1998) of some previous unusually moist growing season such as had
been common in the immediately preceeding years. 
<p> While mosses were not conspicuous, there were
scattered patches of unidentified species of <i>Dicranum</i>, <i>Polytrichum</i> and
<i>Leucobryum</i> and <i>Thuidium</i> <i>delictulum</i>.
<p> Determinations were made of the pH at several
locations near our camp site with the following results:
<ul>
<p> At a site near the water level of Potts Creek within
a few feet of the water, in coarse sandy and slightly organic soil, pH=6.3,
with soil water content of 60%.
<p> At an upland forest site in clay loam under Chestnut
and White Oaks, Red Maple, <i>Potentilla simplex</i> 
and Curtis Goldenrod, pH=5.4.
<p> At a site deeper in the woods, west of the campground
road, in light-colored sandy loam, with Partridge Berry, pH=5.2.
<p> At a site close to patches of <i>Polytrichum</i>, <i>Dicranum</i> and
<i>Leucobryum</i> mosses in sandy, organic
soil, pH=5.5.
<p> At a site along a path just above the Creek near a
patch of the only Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>) seen on this side of Potts
Creek, pH=5.8. This relatively high value,if correct, is surprising and may
represent a metastable occurrence of the Teaberry. Since the location is in the
yearly flood zone, more alkaline sediment than the original substrate for this
plant may have been deposited since it was established.
</ul>
<p> The first section of the loop traverse, covered
during the morning of 9-25-99, extended through the upland forest from the camp
site to the bank of Potts Creek and was terminated at the up-stream end of a
temporary flood channel that contained quiet water.
<p> Observed successively in the upland forest were the
fungus <i>Amanita fulva</i>,
Fringe Tree, Squaw Root in large patches, Cucumbertree, Curtis Goldenrod,
Bigleaf Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i>), Red Maple, a single
mushroom of the spectacular <i>Lactariius indigo</i> 
under Red Maple, followed by the Golden Alexander <i>Zizia aptera </i>and very abundant <i>Suillus granulatus</i>, a
fungus, according to Phillips (1991), frequently associated with White Pine,
but here also under Northern Red Oak and Pitch Pine. Next noted were the forest
grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, Bushy Panic Grass (<i>Panicum</i> 
<i>dichotomum</i>) and Maple-leaf
Viburnum. Then under a large White Pine we saw swarming winged 1/3 inch (0.8
cm) - long black ants, and, in close association with these, small wingless yellow
ants which most likely were not swarming. Also present here were a sapling of
Sugar Maple and Partridge Berry. Then moving onward, we encountered a morning
glory vine (<i>Ipomoea </i> sp), Starry Campion and Honey Mushroom (<i>Armllariella mellea</i>), a superior edible species, but a voracious parasite
on trees.
<p> We here reached the bank of Potts Creek, where we
were immediately attracted by numerous 2/3 inch (1.6 cm) - long coiled
gastropods, at least some of which were of dextral form. Some showed conspicuous
&quot;eat tracks&quot; in which algae or other organic matter had been removed
from flag stones. Seen on the adjacent shaded bank was the alien plant
Moneywort (<i>Lysimachi nummularia</i>) and in the open, on a bar,
the following: River Birch, Smooth Alder, Silky Cornel (<i>Cornus amomum</i>), 
Heart-leaf Willow (<i>Salix rigida</i>), Black Willow (<i>S. 
nigra</i>), Groundnut (<i>Apios americana</i>), Common Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium 
fistulosum</i>), Tall Coneflower (Rudbeckia laciniata), Cardinal Flower (<i>Lobelia cardinalis</i>), Great Blue Lobelia (<i>L. siphilitica</i>), False
Nettle (<i>Boehmeria cylindrica</i>), Northern Swamp Buttercup (
<i>Ranunculus septentrionalis</i>), Riparian Wild Rye (<i>Elymus riparius</i>), Rice
Cutgrass(<i>Leersia oryzoides</i>), the beggar ticks <i>Bidens 
frondosa </i>and <i>B. comosa</i>, Small-flowered St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum mutilum</i>), an
unidentified spike rush (<i>Eleocharis</i> sp) and Woodland Muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia sylvatica</i>) . Of interest also was a rim of red clay at the
water's edge, perhaps indicating the presence of bacteria or other organisms.
<p> We now moved upstream, angling away from the Creek
under an open canopy and an understory of Muscletree, seeing Deer-tongue Grass
(<i>Panicum</i> <i>clandestinum</i>), an
unidentified <i>Suillus</i> fungus under White Pine and, as we
approached the temporary channel, Sensitive Fern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>) . Heard
here was the call of a Raven (<i>
Corvus corax</i>) .
<p> Separating the temporary channel from Potts Creek as
we moved upstream, was an elongate bar composed of sand and shale chips. The
bar was populated by quite large Red Maple, with Sugar Maple, abundant
Muscletree and seedlings of Yellow Buckeye. Winterberry Holly with brilliant
red fruit overhung Potts Creek. Abundant Hog Peanut and Squaw Weed (<i>Senecio</i> <i>obovatus</i>) formed a
ground cover on the bar. At the water's edge of the temporary channel grew
Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>), Purple-stem Aster and the tall
sedge <i>Carex gynandra</i>, while the water contained Marsh Purslane (<i>Ludwigia 
palustris</i>), an unidentified burreed (<i>Sparganium </i> sp) and a luxuriant
growth of a species of the alga <i>Nitella</i>.
Fauna noted were ten inch (25 cm) - long fish of unidentified species, a
Green Frog (<i>Rana clamitans</i>) and a large Bullfrog (<i>Rana 
catesbyiana</i>) .
<p> As we continued up-valley on the bar we noted on
the far bank of the temporary channel
the first Great Rhododendron of the traverse. The bar forest here consisted
abundant White Oak with Red Maple, White Ash, Northern Red Oak, White Pine,
Adelgid -infested saplings of Hemlock, Muscletree and a shrub layer dominated
by Witch Hazel and Spice Bush, Abundant Common Greenbrier was virtually the
only vine, and herbs consisted of Robins Plantain, the tick-trefoil <i>Desmodium</i> <i>nudiflorum</i> and a few
plants of the alien <i>Timpinella saxifraga</i>. A little farther on New York Fern
(<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis</i>) edged the channel under Cucumbertree,
American Basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>
), Shagbark Hickory, Tuliptree and a 20 inch (0.5 m) dbh Beech. Catching our
eyes here was an Elegant Stinkhorn fungus (<i>Mutinus ravenelii</i>) . We now reached the upper
end of the temporary channel, which was marked by exposed roots of Hemlock, and
among these grew the Ringless Honey Mushroom (<i>Amillariella tabescens</i>), 
while in the adjacent upland forest were the fungi <i>Xerula furfuracea </i>and abundant <i>Suillus granulatus</i> (
Phillips, 1991) 
<p> In the afternoon we continued our inventory of the
upland forest, proceeding southwest again from our camp site, but at a greater
distance from the Creek. First noted under the oak-rich canopy were a few plants
of Galax (<i>Galax aphylla</i>), then a single plant of Hispid
Greenbrier (<i>Smilax hispida</i>), a species more characteristic
of rich calcareous woodlands and here perhaps an indicator of locally-enriched
soil. This conclusion was to a degree also supported by the composition of the
greater community, which included Sugar Maple, Beech, Horse Balm (<i>Collinsonia 
canadensis</i>), Wild Geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>) and the grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>.
<p> As we resumed our traverse we noted a 22 inch (0.56
m) dbh Tuliptree, Flowering Dogwood, Yellow Buckeye, Spotted Wintergreen, then
a 29 inch (0.74 m) White Oak, Shagbark Hickory and Downy Rattlesnake
Plantain. 
<p> We then entered what appeared to be more acidic
terrain, with Upland Low Blueberry, Saw Brier, a 25 inch (0.64 m) dbh Scarlet
Oak and Partridge Berry. These were followed by a 31 inch (0.79 m) dbh White
Pine, Sugar Maple, Great Rhododendron, Buffalonut, and a 17 inch (0.43 m) dbh
Black Oak, then Hemlock, seedlings of American Basswood, more Saw Brier, an
isolated plant of Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>), a little Wild Hydrangea and
a mature female Box Turtle (<i>Terrapene carolina</i>) . It should be mentioned that
this was the only occurrence of Black Cohosh recorded on the entire visit.
<p> Here we again reached the head of the temporary
channel, having on this traverse approached it from the opposite side as
previously. Tallied in the vicinity were Black Gum, a single plant of the
forest sedge <i>Carex platyphylla</i>, a fungus of the genus <i>Inocybe </i> in <i>Atrichum </i>moss, more Galax, a 10 inch (25 cm) 
dbh Beech and a sapling of Sourwood (<i>Oxydendrum arboreum</i>) . Also here, as in other
places in this forest, were locally dense, waist-high thickets of saplings that
appeared to be mostly Hophornbeam, but also included some Muscletree. Moving
again up-valley we noted more abundant Galax than before, Pasture Rose,
frequent Maple-leaf Viburnum, a 23 inch (0.58 m) dbh Black Oak, the first
seen sprouts of American Chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>) and a dying 25 inch (0.64 m) 
dbh Hemlock.
<p> Having covered perhaps a half mile (0.8 km) in our
traverse, we arrived at the point where the forest pinches out between the
Creek and the state road. On crossing the road we noted the apparent vigor of
flowering Dogwood, which, at the forest edge was laden with ripe fruit, and in
marked contrast to the frequently diseased forest interior trees. It may be
that nutrients derived from the road gravel was a factor, but this contrast in
growth is also a well-known effect of certain diseases such as anthracnose,
which is favored by forest interior conditions. However, Summer Grape vines
also exhibited more luxuriant growth at the forest edge.
<p> As we again entered the forest and turned our
traverse to the northeast, we saw in succession Panicled Hawkweed, the mosses <i>Campylium</i> <i>chrysophyllum</i> and a
species of <i>Brachythecium</i>, an
unidentified alumroot (<i>Heuchera</i> sp) and a 23 inch (0.58 m) Black
Oak. These were followed by a single
plant of Shrubby St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum sphatulatum</i>), a 24 inch (0. 61 m) dbh
Northern Red Oak, the remains of Bloodroot (<i>
Sanquinaria</i> <i>canadensis</i>) and the Destroying Angel (<i>Amanita virosa</i>) mushroom.
At the base of the nearby slope there was a small patch of Royal Fern (<i>Osmunda regalis</i>) and a Black
Haw Viburnum. At this point we startled a small Wood Frog (<i>Rana 
sylvatica</i>) amidst the leaves of the forest floor, in a typical
appearance of this species at some distance from water.
<p> Resuming our traverse we successively encountered the
fungus <i>Amanita caesaria,</i> a little each of Spotted Wintergreen, Rattlesnake
Weed and Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>), then abundant Black
Oak, a large patch of Squaw Root, numerous seedlings of Sassafras, Upland Low
Blueberry, the preeminently edible mushroom <i>Lepiota procera</i>, a 25 inch (o.64 m) dbh Black
Oak and, as we terminated our traverse, a number of Scarlet Oak.
<p> Some general features of these traverses through the
upland forest were the occurrence throughout of the fungus <i>Suillus granulatus</i>, the
dominance of Common Greenbrier among vines, the sparse but widespread
distribution of Saw Brier, the apparent concentration of macrolichens on Red
Maple and the virtual absence of Poison Ivy. 
<p> Some additional fungi collected on this traverse and
identified by R. Hunsucker were the following:
 
<p> <i>Amanita vaginata</i>
<br> <i>Cortinarius </i> sp
<br> <i>Hebeloma </i> sp
<br> <i>Lactarius peckii</i>
<br> <i>L</i>. sp
<br> <i>Lenzites betulina</i>
<br> <i>Ramaria </i> sp
<br> <i>Russula</i> sp
<br> <i>Suillus americana</i>
<br><i> S. intermedius</i>
<br><i> Tricholoma imbricatum</i> 
 
<p> Our traverse of 9-26-99 along the east side of Potts
Creek occurred during the late morning and early afternoon. It extended from
the northern edge of the National Forest boundary immediately north of the
Campground to the southwest for perhaps 1/4 mile (0.4 km) . The terrain crossed
is a sloping dissected terrace.
<p> Before crossing the Creek however, we noted a few
additional species west of the Creek. These included brilliantly-blooming Late
Purple Aster (<i>Aster patens</i>), the tick-trefoil <i>Desmodium 
viridiflorum</i>, the bush clover <i>Lespedeza intermedia</i>, Wild Potato Vine (<i>Ipomoea 
pandurata</i>), Mockernut Hickory (<i>Carya tomentosa</i>) and Bladdernut (<i>Staphylea 
trifolia</i>) .
<p> On the east side of Potts Creek we found ourselves in
a young forest with a canopy of White Oak, Tuliptree, Red Maple, Shagbark
Hickory, Hemlock, White Pine, White Ash, Virginia Pine and a few Short-leaf
Pine (<i>Pinus</i> <i>echinata</i>
). Some Biltmore Ash was also present. Muscletree and Flowering Dogwood were
understory species. Mountain Laurel, Great Rhododendron, Maple-leaf Viburnum,
Witch Hazel and Upland Low Blueberry formed shrub layers and Common Greenbrier
and Saw Brier were among the few vines. Herbs seen initially were practically
confined to Teaberry, Rattlesnake Weed, Goats Rue (<i>Tephrosia virginiana</i>), 
Plantain-leaf Pussytoes (<i>Antennaria</i> <i>plantaginifolia</i>
), Sessile-leaved Bellwort and Boott's Goldenrod (<i>Solidago boottii</i>) .
<p> As we moved farther up-valley we recorded Scarlet and
Chestnut Oaks, Black Haw Viburnum, Virginia Creeper and an unidentified <i>Amanita</i> 
fungus. Then in a gully or ravine that was largely overgrown by Great
Rhododendron, we also found Big-leaf Aster and Horse Balm. Moving past this ravine we saw the fungus <i>Russula 
xerampelina</i>, a Cucumbertree, Partridge Berry, Christmas Fern, Common
Many Knees, a possible Mockernut Hickory but with small nuts; then Sugar Maple,
Fringe Tree, more Saw Brier, the fungus <i>Amanita rubescens</i> and very abundant and widespread Honey Mushroom very light in
color. 
<p> We now arrived at a small semi-clearing that appeared
to coincide with a patch of soil more fertile than that of the enveloping
terrain. This fertility was indicated by the presence of Black Walnut, White
Ash, abundant Wingstem (<i>Verbesina alternifolia</i>) and the alien grass <i>Microstgium 
vimineum</i>. As we again entered the forest beyond the clearing, we saw
in succession a <i>Psathyrella </i>fungus, the Destroying Angel mushroom,
abundant young White Oak, a single small sapling of Striped Maple (<i>Acer 
pensylvanicum</i>), Teaberry, saplings of Hemlock, Spotted Wintergreen,
Upland Low Blueberry, Delicate Fern Moss covering tree bases and hickories of
unidentified species, with their bases and lower trunks covered by a dense
black and green crust of undetermined composition. Following these were
Northern Red Oak, Mountain Bellwort, the fungi <i>Austroboletus gracilis</i> and the edible <i>Rozites caperata</i>, Mountain
Laurel, Black Oak, Downy Serviceberry and a species of the moss <i>Dicranum</i> on a rock.
<p> Our traverse across the high sloping terrace was
again interrupted by a deep ravine that was vegetated largely by Great
Rhododendron, but was edged largely by Chestnut Oak with Saw Brier and
unidentified species of <i>Leucobryum</i>
and <i>Hypnum</i> mosses, in keeping with
the generally acid character of these soils. However, more fertile, less acid
conditions were indicated by Tree Moss (<i>Climacium americanum</i>) in the bottom of this
ravine near Potts Creek. Our traverse was terminated not far southwest of this
ravine in a very open forest dominated by White Oak, Tuliptree, Northern Red
Oak and Shagbark Hickory. A Pileated Woodpecker (<i>Dryocopus pileatus</i>) was
heard calling here.
<p> The following additional fungi were collected on this
traverse and identified by R. Hunsucker:
 
<p> <i>Agaricus placomyces</i>
<br><i> Albatrellus caeruleoporus</i>
<br><i> Amanita albocreata</i>
<br><i> A. brunnescens </i>var <i>pallida</i>
<br> <i>A</i>. caesarea
<br> <i>A. citrina</i>
<br><i> A. fulva</i>
<br><i> A. polyramis</i>
<br><i> A. vaginata</i>
<br><i> Armillaria caligata</i>
<br><i> Boletus curtisii</i>
<br> <i>Clitocybe sp</i>
<br><i> Hypomyces hyalinus</i> (on <i>Amanita rubescens</i>) 
<br> <i>Lactarius agglutinatus</i>
<br> <i>Psathyrella</i> sp
<br> <i>Russula brevipes</i>
<br><i> Tricholoma resplendens</i>
<br><i> Tylopilus badiceps</i>
 
<br>Lichens
and River Weed, also collected and identified by R. Hunsucker from the east
side of Potts Creek, were the following:
 
<br> <i>Platismatia tuckermanii</i> - a lichen on pine branches.
<br><i>Dermatocarpon 
miniatum</i> - an umbilicate to
foliose lichen on rock in swift water in a portion of the Creek subject to
submersion periodically.
<br> <i>Podostemum ceratophyllum</i> - River Weed partially
covered by sediment.

<p> Our initial visit to the Potts Creek bottomland gave
the impression of a richer,more mesophytic forest than has emerged from these
later inventories, While there are mesophtic enclaves, these seldom rise beyond
Maple- Beech-Tuliptree communities and such demanding species as Basswood, 
Black Walnut and Yellow Buckeye are mere curiosities. Although Potts Creek
itself appears to be circumneutral in character, the forest types at only a
little distance from the stream are highly acidic, and even those mesic in
character are acid-mesic. 
<p> The plant communities here show little or no
boreal/high elevation influences, with no characteristic indicators such as
Canada Mayflower or Wild Sarsaparilla having been found. Thus it appears that
this Valley is not a regular recipient of cool air draining from nearby heights
such as Peters and Potts Mountains. This may be a consequence of the limited
area of high slopes for the accumulation of cool air on these
mountains,combined with the relatively great width of the Valley, which would
allow such air to rapidly dissipate. 
<p> It is also interesting to compare the Potts Creek
bottom land flora with that of the high
terrace at Hidden Valley (see <a href=hiddenvalley.htm>our section on the latter</a>). The well-drained
character of the land along Potts Creek allows certain species such as Chestnut
Oak to exist, while these appear to be excluded by the high water table at the
Hidden Valley high terrace. Conversely, the high terrace is hospitable to
certain wetland species such as Swamp White Oak and supports a far denser herb
layer than does this forest..

<h2>Potts Mountain Pond and Vicinity</h2>
<b>Source Walks: 6-28-93 and 5-14-94</b>
<ul> 
<p>
<p> Potts Pond is a rare wetland on the crest of Potts
Mountain at an elevation of 3550 ft (1080 meters) asl. Lying about a mile east of Forest Road 176,
it may be reached by a jeep trail that follows the edge of the federally
-designated Barbours Creek Wilderness. 
Unfortunately this trail contributes to the degradation of both the
forest and pond by providing access for irresponsible vehicle operators. Because the country rock is Silurian sandstone,
soils are stony and the forest is dry and ericaceous. The approach to the pond passes through a zone which, at this
latitude, exhibits marked effects of elevation on biologic communities. For most of the route the aspect is due
south, emphasizing drought and sun
exposure. The area of the pond itself,
which lies in a minor depression, is, as is usual for wetlands in the Central
Appalachians, at least potential habitat for species far south of their normal
ranges and which may date to the late Ice Age. 
Radiocarbon dating and pollen studies at this Pond reveal a post Ice Age
history dating from 11,000 years BP. 
This record shows that a mixed conifer-northern hardwood forest of oak,
White Pine, spruce, fir and birch persisted to about 9000 years BP when it was
replaced by oak, chestnut, Black Gum and hickory, and that White Pine returned
to the area later (Watts, 1979).
<p> The pond is also habitat for at least two rare
species, a Damselfly <i>Lestes eurinus,</i>
found at only two Virginia sites, and the Northeastern Bullrush, <i>Scirpus ancistrochætus</i>, which has only
13 known populations world-wide and is listed Endangered under the ESA. Consequently the Virginia Division of
Natural Heritage has proposed that the Pond area be designated a “Special
Interest Area-Botanical.”
<p> Elevation at the trailhead on FR 176 is 3320 ft (1010
meters). From there the trail climbs
gradually to 3600 ft (1100 meters) along the south slope of a local 3800 ft
(1160 meter) prominence and then descends to the pond. The forest canopy along this trail is
initially dominated by Chestnut Oak which yields gradually to Black, Scarlet,
Northern Red and White Oak at the highest elevations. At the pond the canopy consists of Northern Red and White Oaks, with
minor Black Gum, Black Birch and Red Maple. 
The forest here is very open with the oaks showing “orchard” form, and
there are many dead trees and much large woody debris is on the ground. The understory on the upland includes
Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>), 
Serviceberry (likely <i>Amelanchier arborea
</i>) and Sassafras, and the shrub layer Bear Oak (<i>Quercus ilicifolia</i>), Mountain Azalea (<i>Rhododendron roseum</i>), Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>), Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia pilosa</i>), Black Huckleberry (<i>Gaylussacia baccata</i>), Upland Low Blueberry, Deerberry and Witch
Hazel in moister areas. There is also
some Beaked Hazelnut (<i>Corylus cornuta</i>) .
<p> Upland herbs along the trail are not abundant but
show considerable diversity. 
Conspicuous at the trailhead was Wild Lily-of-the-Valley (<i>Convallaria montana</i>) blooming in the
still bare-branched May forest. Farther
up the trail Whorled Loosestrife (<i>
Lysimachia quadrifolia</i>), Fly Poison (<i>
Amianthium muscaetoxicum</i>) and brilliant red Fire Pink (<i>Silene virginica</i>) displayed their
blossoms in late June. A spectacular
part of the May floral scene was the size, color, brilliance and variation of
Birdsfoot Violets (<i>Viola pedata</i>) 
along the trail. Other plants seen but
not in bloom along the upland trail were Wood Tickseed (<i>Coreopsis major) </i>, Smooth Forked Chickweed (<i>Paronychia canadensis</i>), Mountain Bellwort (<i>Uvularia pudica</i>), Kidney-leaf Crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus abortivus</i>), Yellow Stargrass (<i>Hypoxis hirsuta</i>), Ovate-leaved violet (<i>Viola fimbriatula</i>), Halberd-leaf Yellow Violet (<i>Viola hastata</i>), Dwarf Iris (<i>Iris verna</i>) and Moccasin Flower (<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>) .
<p> Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>), always an indicator of cool growing
conditions, is common at the higher elevations, as is also Mountain Rice Grass
(<i>Oryzopsis racemosa</i>). The effect here is probably one of pure
lapse rate, or the universal decrease of temperature with elevation, since
position on a slope near the summit precludes cold air accumulation.
<p> While ferns are not abundant, the Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) is the
commonest. Far less common are Ebony
Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium platyneuron</i>)
and Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>), 
with the latter being confined to springy areas.
<p> The pond, which is about 3/4 acre (0.3 hectare) in
area, lies in a watershed not many times greater than itself. Because of the silica-rich soils and the dry
ericaceous oak forest, run-off and ground water are destined to be acid. This inference is borne out by the presence
of insectivorous plants such as Bladderwort (<i>Utricularia</i> sp.) in the
pond (Va. Natural Heritage, 1991) as well as sphagnum and other acid-dependent
plants adjacent to it. Although the
pond has open water in it part of the year, on June 23, 1993 only mud flats
were visible in the vegetation-free area.
<p> The openness of the forest and moist soils near the
pond allow a dense shrub layer to develop. 
Minnie-bush in particular is abundant and large here, but Mountain
Laurel, Wild Raisin (<i>Viburnum cassinoides
</i>), Winterberry Holly and Chokeberry 
(<i>Aronia </i>sp) are also
common. According to Natural Heritage,this
is Red Chokeberry (<i>Aronia arbutifolia</i>) . However Black Chokeberry (<i>Arenia melanocarpa</i> ) may also occur. An interesting Blueberry here is <i>Vaccinium constablæi</i>, a high bush southern Appalachian species
usually restricted to high elevations and which is a hexaploid hybrid. In some places Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax</i> <i> rotundifolium</i>) spreads
over shrubs. Where large shrubs are
less well developed,as on the pond’s west side, the boreal Early Low Blueberry
(<i>Vaccinium angustifolium</i>) covers the
ground.
<p> In moister spots where shrubs and sedges are not too
thick there are lush stands of Cinnamon Fern. 
On the south and west sides of the pond patches of <i>Sphagnum </i>(Species undetermined) extend from the pond edge under the
trees. In places this moss is intergrown
with Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum
canadense</i>) or alternates with patches of Groundberry (<i>Rubus hispidus</i>) and Teaberry (<i>
Gaultheria procumbens</i>) . Less boggy
areas are favored by Painted Trillium (<i>
Trillium undulatum</i>), which in early May was in full bloom. And reminding us that this is Appalachia,
Wild Lily-of-the-Valley, Galax (<i>Galax
aphylla</i>), Southern Bellflower (<i>
Campanula divaricata</i>) and Fly Poison all find a place. In a few places near the pond outlet, where
better soils have accumulated, there are tall plants of Bunch Flower (<i>Melanthium parviflorum</i>) and oversized
Common Solomons Seal or Many Knees, perhaps with more than the normal number of
chromosomes.
<p> In the pond outlet, between large fallen tree trunks,
there is a heavy growth of sedges dominated by <i>Carex crinita</i> or <i>C. gynandra</i> and between these delicate newly sprouting Marsh St. Johnswort (<i>Hypericum virginicum</i>). Also, a little farther down along the outlet
stream, there is a single bush of Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana) </i>, the only example of this species seen on the
Mountain.
<p> In the pond proper a number of sedges accompany the
rare Northeastern Bullrush referred to earlier. On of these is the common <i>Carex
stricta</i>, but another is <i>Carex
canescens</i>, a species that ranges into the Arctic and reaches its southern
limit in the Central Appalachians, where it is usually confined to high
elevation bogs on the Allegheny Plateau. 
It is likely that it is an Ice Age holdover here. Of course the same may be speculated for the
terrestrial species such as Early Low Blueberry, Canada Mayflower and Painted
Trillium, all of which may have occupied the area since glacial times.
<p> In addition to those listed above the following
plants occur near the pond: Great
Chickweed (<i>Stellaria pubera</i>), 
Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola</i> <i>virginiana</i>), RattlesnakeWeed (<i>Hieracium venosum</i>) Hairy Hawkweed(<i>Hieracium granovii</i>), Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>), 
Gall-of-the-Earth (<i>Prenanthes trifoliata</i>)
and Wild Sarsaparilla. Although the
last mentioned species was encountered earlier along the trail its abundance on
the dry upland around the pond is worthy of mention. Significantly this species and the boreal species in the lowland
near the pond are probably subject to cold air drainage/accumulation as well as
the effect of elevation, a characteristic which also explains the absence of
oaks other than Northern Red and White Oak in the pond area.
<p> Although time permitted little more than a casual
notice of fauna, a number of species made noteworthy impressions. Among amphibians were Peepers (<i>Hyla crucifer</i>) calling in May, Gray Tree Frogs ( <i>Hyla versicolor /
chrysocelis</i>), and the general abundance of little hoppers among the
sedges, as well as tadpoles in June. 
And in agreement with their habitat demands of "woody and mossy margins
of swamps" (Smith, 1978) were several Four-Toed Salamanders (<i>Hemidactylium scutatum</i>) found under
rocks in the pond area. Birds were most
in evidence in May with the song of a Rose-breasted Grossbeak (<i>Pheucticus melanocephalus</i>) giving a
send-off to our hike, in the accompanying calls of scarlet Tanagers (<i>Piranga olivacea</i>), the activities of
Juncos (<i>Junco hyemalis</i>) in bushes
along the trail, and Great Crested Flycatchers (<i>Myiarchus crinitus</i>) in the pond area. It is likely that last-mentioned birds were encouraged by the
swarms of biting Black Flies which attacked us on both visits.
<p> A conspicuous feature of the forest in the pond
vicinity on the June 1993 visit was a pervasive defoliation not only of the
oaks but also much of the shrub layer, including Minnie-bush, Witch Hazel and
even Blueberry. Careful examination was
not possible although the tattered foliage resembled a Gypsy Moth (<i>Lymantria dispar</i>) onslaught. 
However no evidence of this insect was seen, and the area lies considerably
south of known infestations at that time. 
The 1994 visit revealed little more, since the oaks at that time had
only begun to bud, and again there was no sign of defoliators.

<h2>Peters Mountain at Paint Bank</h2>
<b>Source Walk: 5-15-94</b>
<ul>
<p> Peters Mountain is perhaps best known for the Peters
Mountain Mallow, <i>Iliamna corei</i>, the
rarest plant in Virginia and one of the rarest anywhere (Porter, 1991). <i>I.
corei </i>grows in xeric oak summit forest near the mountain’s southwestern
terminus at the “Narrows,” where the New River cuts through the ranges. From the Narrows Peters Mountain extends NE
for 30 miles (50 km) in part along the Virginia-West Virginia boundary, then
into Virginia to 5 miles (8 km) west of Covington. Structurally complex, the Range is anticlinal in the northeast
and synclinal in the southwest and is cut by numerous faults. In general the spine of the range consists
of Silurian sandstones such as the Tuscarora Formation but also includes
carbonate-rich rocks such as the Tonoloway Limestone. Superficial but important features include many rock falls, talus
slopes, debris trains, block fields and alluvial fan deposits. Many of these features, which bear directly
on forest ecology, have been mapped only recently and are presented in the
Geologic Map of Giles County (Rader
and Gathright, <i></i>1986). Other features of the range are a series of
near-summit wetlands, tracts of ancient forest and the federally-designated
Peters Mountain Wilderness.
<p> Our traverse here is confined to that part of the
slope immediately northwest of Paint Bank, Virginia. This slope, which faces Potts Moutain., is just up the valley
from the Steel Bridge area . It may be
reached via Forest Road 50031 from State Road 311. The first part of the
traverse is along FR 50002-1A, which climbs in switchbacks to access a large
timber cut at the 3000 ft. (910 meter) level. 
Canopy species between 2800 ft (850 meters) and this level consist
chiefly of Chestnut Oak with lesser amounts of other oaks, Pignut, Black Gum
and Red Maple. White Oak increases in
amount upward. There are many American
Chestnut sprouts and Sourwood (<i>Oxydendrum
aboreum</i>) and Striped Maple form an understory. The latter also increases with elevation. Above the timber cut, on a steep, rocky
slope, Black Birch is abundant, Chestnut Oak increasingly assumes
“orchard”-like forms and down trees and large woody debris are conspicuous.
<p> Shrubs generally present on the entire slope are
Mountain Laurel, Pink Azalea (in bloom), Deerberry, Upland Low Blueberry and
St. Andrews Cross (<i>Hypericum hypericoides</i>). Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolius</i>) Vines are abundant upward. Herbs noted along the road below 3000 ft.
(910 meter) were Small’s Ragwort (<i>Senecio
smallii</i>). Ovate-leaved Violet (<i>Viola fimbriatula</i>), Wild Sage (<i>Salvia lyrata</i>), Hairy Angelica (<i>Angelica venenosa</i>), <i>Galax aphylla</i>, the alien Ox-eye Daisy (<i>Chrysanthemum leucanthemum</i>) and Bracken
(<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) and
Hay-scented (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>) Ferns. Hairy Angelica continued to be abundant to
the highest elevations and <i>Leucobryum</i>
cushion moss was common at tree bases on the upper slope.
<p> Near the mountain crest at perhaps 3400 ft (1040
meters), but still on the SE slope, there is a series of springs and associated
small wetlands. The canopy in the
moister area around these springs, which were flowing copiously, consists of
mature but not very large White, Northern Red and Chestnut Oaks, Black Gum, Red
Maple, Black Birch and Pitch Pine with Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier </i>sp) in
the understory. Highbush Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium corymbosum</i>) is first
encountered in the general area and increases in frequency and size the nearer
the springs are approached. Other
shrubs in this wetland area are Mountain Laurel, Minnie-bush, Wild Raisin,
Witch Hazel, an unidentified species of Chokeberry (<i>Aronia</i> sp.) and Smooth
Alder. Pink Azalea in the area was
being worked by large queen bumblebees. 
On the spring banks, under overarching trees and shrubs, Canada
Mayflower, Star Flower (<i>Trientalis borealis</i>), Indian Cucumber-root
and Kidney-leaved Grass-of Parnassus (<i>Parnassia 
asarifolia ) </i>, were
associated with patches of <i>Sphagnum </i>miss. In more open areas grew Cinnamon Fern, Mana Grass (<i>Glycena</i> 
sp.), the Bullrush, <i>Scirpus
vericundus</i> and the sedge <i>Carex leptalea</i>. The last named species, in addition to this
acid environment, is also found in calcareous wetlands with a pH near seven.
<p> Fauna observed on this traverse included both male
and female Scarlet Tanagers, Rose-breasted Grosbeaks, a Box Turtle (<i>Terrapene carolina</i>), Red-backed
Salamanders (<i>Plethodon cinereus</i>) and
the familiar large yellow and black millipedes with the odor of bitter almond (
<i>Sigmoria</i> sp ?) — all on the slope forest. 
In the wetland area Ruffed Grouse 
(<i>Bonasa umbellus</i>) were
flushed, and Black-throated Blue Warblers (<i>Dendroica cærulescens</i>) sang from the
shrubbery. In an opening among trees a
Coopers Hawk(<i>Accipiter cooperii</i>) flew just overhead.
<p> The described spring area lies just NE of a large
rectangle of private land and the spring line presumably persists in that
direction. Indeed the Jefferson
National Forest has proposed the national forest tract to the southwest of this
private land as a special interest area.
<p> The occurrence of cold-climate herbs such as Canada
Mayflower and Star Flower on this upper slope, which is not subject to cold air
drainage/accumulation, indicates that this occurrence results from a pure
elevational effect, especially in as much as the aspect is strongly
southeast. Also the acidic character of
the spring area as indicated by the flora is in harmony with a likely sandstone
rock base. These conditions probably
also prevent colonization by such species as Yellow Buckeye which have outposts
in the Potts Creek Valley.
