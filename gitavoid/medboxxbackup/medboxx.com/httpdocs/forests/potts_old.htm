Like that ofWarm Springs Mountain, this anticline is capped by erosion-resistant Siluriansandstone that forms the backbone of high ridges.  It is also breached,exposing the same Ordovician formations that are present in the Warm SpringsValley .  While Potts Mtn. has no prominent knobs such as characterize someother ranges, the main ridge reaches 3800 ft. (1160 meters), and elevationplays a part in determining its biologic communities.<p><p></ul><b>Potts Creek Floodplain</b><br><b>Source Walk 5-13-94</b><p><ul>	Potts Creek, a branch of the Jackson River, flows northeast at the base of thenorthwest slope of Potts Mountain in a valley dominated by Devonian shales.  Atthe Steel Bridge campground of the Jefferson National Forest a rich mixedmesophyte forest occupies the bottomland along the stream.  This forest, atapproximately 1700 ft. (520 meters) elevation, is one of the easternmostoutposts of a characteristic species of this forest type, Yellow Buckeye, andprovides an interesting contrast with mesophytic cove forests to the east.  Thestream is also habitat for the rare James River Spiny Mussel (<i>Pleurobemacollina</i>) which is listed Endangered under the Endangered Species Act.<p>	In an inventory of several hours duration in the vicinity of the campground,21 canopy tree species, 18 small trees and 31 herbs were identified.  Canopyspecies included Canada Hemlock( <i>Tsuga canadensis </i>)(apparentlyAdelgid-free), Red and Sugar Maples, White, Chestnut, Scarlet, Black andNorthern Red Oaks, Shagbark and Pignut Hickories, American Basswood, YellowBuckeye, White Ash, Black Locust, Black Walnut, Tuliptree, Sassafras, Virginiaand White Pines, and along the stream, Black Willow (<i>Salix nigra</i>) andRiver Birch (<i>Betula nigra</i>).  Small trees and shrubs are Hophornbeam (<i>Ostrya virginiana </i>), Musclewood (<i> Carpinus caroliniana </i>), Floweringand Alternate-leaved Dogwood (<i> Cornus florida  </i>and <i>C.alternifolia</i>), Witch Hazel (<i> Hamamelis virginiana </i>), Black Haw, Maple-leaf andArrowwood Viburnums ( <i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>, <i>V.acerifolium  </i>and<i>V.dentatum </i>) , Hawthorn (<i> Crataegus</i> sp ), Fringetree(<i>Chionanthus virginica)</i>, Buffalonut (<i>Pyrularia pubera</i>),Leatherwood (<i>Dirca palustris</i>), Great Rhododendron ( <i>Rhododendronmaximum</i> ), Flame Azalea (<i> R.calendulaceum</i> ), Deerberry (<i>Vaccinium staminium </i>), Upland Low Blueberry (<i> V.pallidum </i>), andclose to the stream, Smooth Alder ( <i>Alnus serrulata </i>) and WinterberryHolly (<i> Ilex</i> <i>verticillata </i>).  Very likely this list, particularlywith regard to canopy species, is incomplete.  For example, White Basswood, acommon associate of Yellow Buckeye in typical mixed mesophyte forest, isexpected here, as is Sycamore (<i>Platanus occidentalis</i>), a tree which isalmost a fixture on such streams and may be missed through over-familiarity andobviousness.( Yes! seen by us on later visits ).<p>	The list of herbaceous plants is doubtless even less complete.  Thoseidentified are as follows:  Wild Stonecrop (<i>Sedum ternatum</i>), Wild SweetWilliam (<i>Phlox maculata</i>), Lovage (<i>Ligusticum canadense</i>) of whichtea was made, Golden Alexanders (<i>Zizia aptera</i>  and <i>Z.trifoliata</i>), Fringed Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia ciliata</i>), FloweringSpurge (<i> Euphorbia corollata </i>), White Wood, Wavy-leaf, Purplestem andFlat-top White Asters ( <i>Aster divaricatus,A.undulatus,A.puniceus</i> and<i>A.umbellatus </i>), Robins Plantain  (<i>Erigeron pulchellus </i>),Entire-leaved Yellow Foxglove (<i>Aureolaria l&aelig;vigata</i>), Wild Geranium(<i> Geranium maculatum </i>), Wood Anemone ( <i>Anemone quinquefolia </i>),Solomons Seal or "Many Knees" (<i>Polygonatum biflorum</i>), Sessile-leavedBellwort (<i> Uvularia sessilifolia </i>), Plume Lily (<i> Smilacina racemosa</i>), Filmy Angelica ( <i>Angelica triquinata </i>), Hairy Disporum(<i>Disporum lanuginosum )</i>, Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex</i>),the legumes Wild Vetch ( <i>Vicia caroliniana </i>)and Veiny Peavine(<i>Lathyrus venosus)</i>, the root parasites Squawroot ( <i>Conopholisamericana </i>)and One-flowered Broomrape (<i>Orobanche uniflora</i>), thegrass Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>) and the sedges <i>Carexlaxiflora</i>  and <i>C. torta</i>.  The last mentioned sedge is a tough,flood-resistant species that populates stream beds.<p>	In terms of chemical environment Hemlock and Ericac&aelig; such as<i>Rhododendron</i> and <i>Vaccinium</i> indicate at least a marginally acidsubstrate where these plants occur.  However the mollusk fauna in the streamand widespread occurrence of carbonates in the Devonian country rock seem toimply a strong counter balance to the prevalent regional acidic conditions.<p><p></ul><b>Potts Mountain Pond and Vicinity</b><br><b>Source Walks: 6-28-93 and 5-14-94</b><p><ul>	Potts Pond is a rare wetland on the crest of Potts Mountain at an elevation of3550 ft (1080 meters) asl.  Lying about a mile east of Forest Road 176, it maybe reached by a jeep trail that follows the edge of the federally -designatedBarbours Creek Wilderness.  Unfortunately this trail contributes to thedegradation of both the forest and pond by providing access for irresponsiblevehicle operators.  Because the country rock is Silurian sandstone, soils arestony and the forest is dry and ericaceous.  The approach to the pond passesthrough a zone which, at this latitude, exhibits marked effects of elevation onbiologic communities.  For most of the route the aspect is due south,emphasizing drought and sun exposure.  The area of the pond itself, which liesin a minor depression, is, as is usual for wetlands in the CentralAppalachians, at least potential habitat for species far south of their normalranges and which may date to the late Ice Age.  Radiocarbon dating and pollenstudies at this Pond reveal a post Ice Age history dating from 11,000 years BP.This record shows that a mixed conifer-northern hardwood forest of oak, WhitePine, Spruce, Fir and birch persisted to about 9000 years BP when it wasreplaced by oak, chestnut, Black Gum and Hickory and that White Pine returnedto the area later (Watts, 1979).<p>	The pond is also habitat for at least two rare species, a Damselfly <i>Lesteseurinus,</i> found at only two Virginia sites, and the Northeastern Bullrush,<i>Scirpus ancistroch&aelig;tus</i>, which has only 13 known populationsworld-wide and is listed Endangered under the ESA.  Consequently the VirginiaDivision of Natural Heritage has proposed that the Pond area be designated a"Special Interest Area-Botanical."<p>	Elevation at the trailhead on FR 176 is 3320 ft (1010 meters).  From there thetrail climbs gradually to 3600 ft (1100 meters) along the south slope of alocal 3800 ft (1160 meter) prominence and then descends to the pond.  Theforest canopy along this trail is initially dominated by Chestnut Oak whichyields gradually to Black, Scarlet, Northern Red and White Oak at the highestelevations.  At the pond the canopy consists of Northern Red and White Oak withminor Black Gum, Black Birch and Red Maple.  The forest here is very open withthe oaks showing "orchard" form and there are many dead trees and much largewoody debris is on the ground.  The understory on the upland includes StripedMaple ( <i>Acer pensylvanicum </i>), Serviceberry ( likely <i>Amelanchierarborea </i>) and Sassafras and the shrub layer Bear Oak ( <i>Quercusilicifolia </i>), Mountain Azalea (<i>Rhododendron roseum</i>), Mountain Laurel( <i>Kalmia latifolia </i>), Minnie-bush ( <i>Menziesia pilosa </i>),BlackHuckleberry ( <i>Gaylussacia baccata </i>), Upland Low Blueberry, Deerberry andWitch Hazel in moister areas.  There is also some Beaked Hazelnut (<i> Coryluscornuta </i>).<p>	Upland herbs along the trail are not abundant but show considerable diversity.Conspicuous at the trailhead was Wild Lily-of-the-Valley (<i>Convallariamontana</i>) blooming in the still bare-branched May forest.  Farther up thetrail Whorled Loosestrife (<i> Lysimachia quadrifolia </i>), Fly Poison (<i>Amianthium muscaetoxicum </i>) and brilliant red Fire Pink (<i>Silenevirginica</i>) displayed their blossoms in late June.  A spectacular part ofthe May floral scene was the size, color, brilliance and variation of BirdsfootViolets ( <i>Viola pedata </i>) along the trail.  Other plants seen but not inbloom along the upland trail were Wood Tickseed (<i>Coreopsis major )</i>,Smooth Forked Chickweed (<i>Paronychia canadensis</i>), Mountain Bellwort (<i>Uvularia pudica </i>), Kidney-leaf Crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus abortivus</i>),Yellow Stargrass (<i> Hypoxis hirsuta </i>), Ovate-leaved violet (<i>Violafimbriatula</i>), Halberd-leaf Yellow Violet (<i>Viola hastata</i>), Dwarf Iris(<i>Iris verna</i>) and Moccasin Flower ( <i>Cypripedium acaule</i> ).<p>	Wild Sarsaparilla ( <i>Aralia nudicaulis</i> ), always an indicator of coolgrowing conditions, is common at the higher elevations, as is also MountainRice Grass (<i>Oryzopsis racemosa</i>).  The effect here is probably one ofpure lapse rate, or the universal decrease of temperature with elevation, sinceposition on a slope near the summit precludes cold air accumulation.<p>	While ferns are not abundant, the Bracken (<i> Pteridium aquilinum </i>)is thecommonest.  Far less common are Ebony Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium platyneuron</i>)and Cinnamon (<i> Osmunda cinnamomea </i>), with the latter being confined tospringy areas.<p>	The pond, which is about 3/4 acre (0.3 hectare) in area, lies in a watershednot many times greater than itself.  Because of the silica-rich soils and thedry ericaceous oak forest, run-off and ground water are destined to be acid.This inference is borne out by the presence of insectivorous plants such asBladderwort (<i>Utricularia</i>  sp.) in the pond (Va. Natural Heritage, 1991)as well as sphagnum and other acid-dependent plants adjacent to it.  Althoughthe pond has open water in it part of the year, on June 23, 1993 only mud flatswere visible in the vegetation-free area.<p>	The openness of the forest and moist soils near the pond allow a dense shrublayer to develop.  Minnie-bush in particular is abundant and large here, butMountain Laurel, Wild Raisin (<i>Viburnum cassinoides </i>), Winterberry Hollyand Chokeberry  ( <i>Aronia </i>sp ) are also common.  According to NaturalHeritage this is Red Chokeberry (<i> Aronia arbutifolia </i>).  However BlackChokeberry (<i>Arenia melanocarpa</i>  ) may also occur.  An interestingBlueberry here is <i>Vaccinium constabl&aelig;i</i>, a high bush southernAppalachian species usually restricted to high elevations and which is ahexaploid hybrid.  In some places Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax</i> <i>rotundifolium </i>) spreads over shrubs.  Where large shrubs are less welldeveloped,as on the pond's west side, the boreal Early Low Blueberry(<i>Vaccinium angustifolium</i> )covers the ground.<p>	In moister spots where shrubs and sedges are not too thick there are lushstands of Cinnamon Fern.  On the south and west sides of the pond patches of<i>Sphagnum </i>(Species undetermined) extend from the pond edge under thetrees.  In places this moss is intergrown with Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense </i>) or alternates with patches of Groundberry(<i>Rubus hispidus</i>) and Teaberry (<i> Gaultheria procumbens </i>).  Lessboggy areas are favored by Painted Trillium (<i> Trillium undulatum</i> ),whichin early May was in full bloom.  And reminding us that this is Appalachia, WildLily-of-the-Valley, Galax (<i>Galax aphylla</i> ), Southern Bellflower (<i>Campanula divaricata </i>) and Fly Poison all find a place.  In a few placesnear the pond outlet, where better soils have accumulated there are tall plantsof Bunch Flower (<i>Melanthium parviflorum</i>) and oversized Common SolomonsSeal , perhaps with more than the normal number of chromosomes.<p>	In the pond outlet, between large fallen tree trunks, there is a heavy growthof sedges dominated by <i>Carex crinita</i>  or <i>C. gynandra</i>  and betweenthese delicate newly sprouting Marsh St. Johnswort (<i>Hypericumvirginicum</i>).  Also, a little farther down along the outlet stream, there isa single bush of Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana )</i>, the only example ofthis species seen on the Mountain.<p>	In the pond proper a number of sedges accompany the rare Northeastern Bullrushreferred to earlier.  On of these is the common <i>Carex stricta</i> ,butanother is <i>Carex canescens</i>, a species that ranges into the Arctic andreaches its southern limit in the Central Appalachians, where it is usuallyconfined to high elevation bogs on the Allegheny Plateau.  It is likely that itis an Ice Age holdover here.  Of course the same may be speculated for theterrestrial species such as Early Low Blueberry, Canada Mayflower and PaintedTrillium, all of which may have occupied the area since glacial times.<p>	In addition to those listed above the following plants occur near the pond:Great Chickweed (<i> Stellaria pubera </i>), Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola</i> <i>virginiana </i>), RattlesnakeWeed (<i> Hieracium venosum</i>) Hairy Hawkweed(<i>Hieracium granovi</i>), Four-leaved Yam (<i> Dioscoreaquaternata </i>), Gall-of-the-Earth (<i>Prenanthes trifoliata</i>) and WildSarsaparilla.  Although the last mentioned species was encountered earlieralong the trail its abundance on the dry upland around the pond is worthy ofmention.  Significantly this species and the boreal species in the lowland nearthe pond are probably subject to cold air drainage/accumulation as well as theeffect of elevation, a characteristic which also explains the absence of oaksother than Northern Red and White Oak in the pond area.<p>	Although time permitted little more than a casual notice of fauna, a number ofspecies made noteworthy impressions.  Among amphibians were Peepers (<i>Hylacrucifer</i>) calling in May, Chorus Frogs (<i>Pseudocris</i>  sp.) and thegeneral abundance of little hoppers among the sedges as well as tadpoles inJune.  And in agreement with their habitat demands of "woody and mossy marginsof swamps" (Smith, 1978) were several Four-Toed Salamanders (<i>Hemidactyliumscutatum</i>) found under rocks in the pond area.  Birds were most in evidencein May with the song of a Rose-breasted Grossbeak ( <i>Pheucticusmelanocephalus </i>) giving a send-off to our hike, in the accompanying callsof scarlet Tanagers (<i> Piranga olivacea </i>), the activities of Juncos (<i>Junco hyemalis </i>) in bushes along the trail and Great Crested Flycatchers(<i> Myiarchus crinitus </i>) in the pond area.  It is likely thatlast-mentioned birds were encouraged by the swarms of biting Black Flies whichattacked us on both visits.<p>	A conspicuous feature of the forest in the pond vicinity on the June 1993visit was a pervasive defoliation not only of the oaks but also much of theshrub layer, including Minnie-bush, Witch Hazel and even Blueberry.  Carefulexamination was not possible although the tattered foliage resembled a GypsyMoth onslaught.  However no evidence of this insect was seen, and the area liesconsiderably south of known infestations at that time.  The 1994 visit revealedlittle more, since the oaks at that time had only begun to bud, and again therewas no sign of defoliators.<p><p></ul><b>Peters Mountain at Paint Bank</b><br><b>Source Walk: 5-15-94</b><p><ul>	Peters Mountain is perhaps best known for the Peters Mountain Mallow,<i>Iliamna corei</i>, the rarest plant in Virginia and one of the rarestanywhere (Porter, 1991).  <i>I. corei </i>grows in xeric oak summit forest nearthe mountain's southwestern terminus at the "Narrows," where the New River cutsthrough the ranges.  From the Narrows Peters Mountain extends NE for 30 miles(50 km) in part along the Virginia-West Virginia boundary, then into Virginiato 5 miles (8 km) west of Covington.  Structurally complex, the Range isanticlinal in the northeast and synclinal in the southwest and is cut bynumerous faults.  In general the spine of the range consists of Siluriansandstones such as the Tuscarara Formation but also includes carbonate-richrocks such as the Tonoloway Limestone.  Superficial but important featuresinclude many rock falls, talus slopes, debris trains, block fields and alluvialfan deposits.  Many of these features, which bear directly on forest ecology,have been mapped only recently and are presented in the Geologic Map of GilesCounty (Rader<i>et al </i>1986).  Other features of the range are a series ofnear-summit wetlands, tracts of ancient forest and the federally-designatedPeters Mountain Wilderness.<p>	Our traverse here is confined to that part of the slope immediately northwestof Paint Bank, Virginia.  This slope, which faces Potts Mtn., is just up thevalley from the Steel Bridge area .  It may be reached via Forest Road 50031from State Road 311. The first part of the traverse is along FR 50002-1A, whichclimbs in switchbacks to access a large timber cut at the 3000 ft. (910 meter)level.  Canopy species between 2800 ft (850 meters) and this level consistchiefly of Chestnut Oak with lesser amounts of other oaks, Pignut, Black Gumand Red Maple.  White Oak increases in amount upward.  There are many AmericanChestnut sprouts and Sourwood (<i>Oxydendrum aboreum</i>) and Striped Mapleform an understory.  The latter also increases with elevation.  Above thetimber cut, on a steep, rocky slope, Black Birch is abundant, Chestnut Oakincreasingly assumes "orchard"-like forms and down trees and large woody debrisand conspicuous.<p>	Shrubs generally present on the entire slope are Mountain Laurel, Pink Azalea(in bloom), Deerberry, Upland Low Blueberry and St. Andrews Cross (<i>Hypericumhypericoides</i>).  Virginia Creeper ( <i>Parthenocissus quinquefolius</i>)Vines are abundant upward.  Herbs noted along the road below 3000 ft. (910meter) were Small's Ragwort (<i>Senecio smallii</i>).  Ovate-leaved Violet(<i>Viola fimbriatula</i>), Wild Sage (<i>Salvia lyrata</i>), Hairy Angelica(<i> Angelica venenosa </i>), <i>Galax aphylla</i>, the alien Ox-eye Daisy (<i>Chrysanthemum leucanthemum</i> )and Bracken ( <i>Pteridium aquilinum </i>)andHay-scented ( <i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula </i>)Ferns.  Hairy Angelicacontinued to be abundant to the highest elevations and <i>Leucobryum</i>cushion moss was common at tree bases on the upper slope.<p>	Near the mountain crest at perhaps 3400 ft (1040 meters), but still on the SEslope, there is a series of springs and associated small wetlands.  The canopyin the moister area around these springs, which were flowing copiously,consists of mature but not very large White, Northern Red and Chestnut Oaks,Black Gum, Red Maple, Black Birch and Pitch Pine with Serviceberry  (<i>Amelanchier </i>sp ) in the understory.  Highbush Blueberry (<i>Vacciniumcorymbosum</i>) is first encountered in the general area and increases infrequency and size the nearer the springs are approached.  Other shrubs in thiswetland area are Mountain Laurel, Minnie-bush, Wild Raisin, Witch Hazel, anunidentified species of Chokeberry (<i>Aronia</i>  sp.) and Smooth Alder.  PinkAzalea in the area was being worked by large queen bumblebees.  On the springbanks, under overarching trees and shrubs, Canada Mayflower, Star Flower (<i>Trientalis borealis </i>), Indian Cucumber-root and  Kidney-leaved Grass-ofParnassus (<i>Parnassia asarifolia  )</i>, were associated with patches of<i>Sphagnum</i>.  In more open areas grew Cinnamon Fern, Mana Grass(<i>Glycena</i>  sp.), the Bullrush, <i>Scirpus vericundus</i>  and the sedge<i>Carex leptalea</i>.  The last named species, in addition to this acidenvironment, is also found in calcareous wetlands with a pH near seven.<p>	Fauna observed on this traverse included both male and female ScarletTanagers, Rose-breasted Grosbeaks, a Box Turtle (<i> Terrapene carolina </i>),Red-backed Salamanders ( <i>Plethodon cinereus </i>)and the familiar largeyellow and black millipedes with the odor of bitter almond ( <i>Sigmoria</i>sp ? )-- all on the slope forest.  In the wetland area Ruffed Grouse  (<i>Bonasa umbellus </i>)were flushed, and Black-throated Blue Warblers(<i>Dendroica c&aelig;rulescens</i>) sang from the shrubbery.  In an openingamong trees a Coopers Hawk(<i>Accipiter cooperii </i>) flew just overhead.<p>	The described spring area lies just NE of a large rectangle of private landand the spring line presumably persists in that direction.  Indeed theJefferson National Forest has proposed the national forest tract to thesouthwest of this private land as a special interest area.<p>	The occurrence of cold-climate herbs such as Canada Mayflower and Star Floweron this upper slope, which is not subject to cold air drainage/accumulationindicates that this occurrence results from a pure elevational effect,especially in as much as the aspect is strongly southeast.  Also the acidiccharacter of the spring area as indicated by the flora is in harmony with alikely sandstone rock base.  These conditions probably also preventcolonization by such species as Yellow Buckeye which have outposts in the PottsCreek Valley.<p></FONT><p></ul><a href=".">Back to Forests of the Central Appalachians</a> | <a href="feedback.php">Feedback</a></BODY></HTML>
