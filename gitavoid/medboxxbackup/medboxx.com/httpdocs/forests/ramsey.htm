<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
 
 
	<p>	Ramsey's
	Draft is a branch of the Calfpasture River and thus a part of the
	James System. In its upper reaches it flows southwest, bisecting
	massive Shenandoah Mountain along the axis of that Mountain's
	synclinal structure. Rocks underlying much of the watershed are
	Devonian Hampshire Formation, but Mississippian Pocono caps some of
	the highest elevations. These rocks are dominantly erosion-resistant
	sandstone, but also include beds of mudstone, siltstone, shale and
	even thin beds of coal  (Rader and Evans, 1993).   Because of the
	large amounts of exposed rock and stony soils in the upper
	watershed, Ramsey's Draft is prone to low water in dry seasons as
	well as catastrophic flash floods. Consequently debris dams, bank
	and bed erosion and shifting channels characterize its hydrologic
	regime. Six miles  (10 km)  southwest of its headwaters the Draft
	makes a right angle bend to the southeast and occupies a wider flood
	plain to its confluence with the Calfpasture. Most of the watershed
	above this bend, the most mountainous part, is now included within
	the federally- designated Ramsey's Draft Wilderness of the George
	Washington National Forest. A point of reference is the Mountain
	House Recreation Site, which is located at the bend and just off US
	Route 250. The elevation here is near 2200 feet  (671 m)  asl.,
	while the highest point in the watershed is Hardscrabble Knob at
	4282 feet  (1307 m), approximately 5 miles  (8 km)  to the
	northeast.<p>
		Located
	in the highest part of the watershed and within the wilderness, is a
	designated research natural area  (RNA).  Within the RNA the
	Virginia Division of Natural Heritage has established ten test
	plots, 400 square meters each in area. Each of these plots was
	inventoried by Natural Heritage investigators throughout the growing
	season for vascular plants, community types and ecological and
	physical characteristics  (Rawinski <i>et al</i>, 1994).  These
	inventories provide a highly informative comparison with those done
	by us in the lower watershed as reported on here.<p>
		Fansler
	 (1984)  identified 255 species of vascular plants in his study of
	both the lower and upper watershed, including the RNA. However he
	did not record a number of common species  (Rawinski <i>et al</i>,
	1994) <p>
		Conditions
	within the RNA are almost universally severe by most mountain forest
	standards. However these conditions are greatly ameliorated in the
	lower watershed in which there appears to be a diverse mesic flora.
	Rawinski <i>et al</i>  identified a total of 123 vascular plants in
	the RNA test plots, and our inventories in the same general area
	identified a few additional northern/high elevation species outside
	their plots  (see our <a href=hardscrabble.htm>Ascent of Big Bald and Hardscrabble Knobs</a>),   
	Six rapid inventories conducted by us during parts of five days in
	the lower watershed disclosed a total of at least 122 vascular
	plants, and this despite three of our inventories occurring in
	October and November. In what follows both scientific and common
	names of species are given on first mention but, with a few
	exceptions, only common names thereafter.<p>
		The
	flora of the RNA test plots, and that of the upper watershed in
	general, is dominated by dry, ericaceous oak forest in which species
	such as Northern Red and Chestnut Oaks  (<i>Quercus  rubra</i> and Q
	 <i>prinus</i>),   Mountain Laurel  (<i>Kalmia  latifolia</i>), 
	Teaberry  (<i>Gaultheria  procumbens</i>)  and other acidiphiles
	play important roles. However, in a few test plots that were located
	in the vicinity of the stream, the canopy contains old growth  (in
	excess of 300 years)  Canada Hemlock  (<i>Tsuga  canadensis</i>)  to
	3.9 feet  (1.18 m)  dbh and White Pine almost as large. Even the
	richest of these plots are acid-mesic and exhibit low plant
	diversity. For example, only 16 species of vascular plants were
	found in the plot with the largest Hemlock and White Pine  (<i>Pinus
	</i> <i>strobus </i>). The most diverse of the plots, with 44
	vascular plants, is not old growth and occurs in a high  (3460 feet/
	1055 m) cove. At the highest elevations northern and montane species
	such as Mountain Ash  (<i>Pyrus </i> <i>americana </i>), Red
	Raspberry  (<i>Rubus  strigosus</i>),  Mountain Holly (<i> Ilex </i>
	<i>montana</i>)  and Early Low Blueberry  (<i>Vaccinium 
	angustifolium</i>)  are found. The region as a whole exhibits a
	&quot;mirror effect&quot;  (Mueller, 1998)  in which a number of
	these cold-climate species are also found in the valley flats at the
	lowest elevations studied, but generally not at intermediate
	elevations. Thus Yellow Birch  (<i>Betula  alleghaniensis </i>) is
	practically confined to the highest elevations and the lowest valley
	flats, but only Black Birch  (<i>Betula  lenta</i>)  occurs at
	intermediate elevations. We shall see this effect apparent in other
	species found in our inventory of the lower watershed.<p>
		Ramsey's
	Draft Wilderness is part of as yet unprotected national forest
	wildland that is a promise of a greater eastern wilderness resource
	and concept. In 1986 this <i>de facto</i>  wildland was given the
	name 'Shenandoah Wilderness&quot;  (Mueller, 1991)  in a proposal
	that would encompass Ramsey's Draft and its immediate surroundings
	and extend northeast over two major watersheds, those of the North
	and Little Rivers, for a total of 65,000 acres  (26,000 ha).  It
	would be the largest national forest wilderness east of the
	Mississippi and Ramsey's Draft would be its primary portal. This
	location is one of the very few in the eastern US where such a large
	wilderness could be designated. It is an area and a vision of
	geographic and ecological coherence, a place where politics will
	hopefully yield eventually to nature and science. Recently this
	propose wilderness has been renamed the &quot;Ernie Dickerman
	Wilderness&quot;  (Mueller, 1999) in honor of one of our most
	prominent deceased wilderness activists.<p>

	We
	here present the results of our six inventories. We first report on
	a traverse that extended perhaps 1/5 mile  (0.32 km)  downstream
	from the bend in Ramsey's Draft at Mountain House, along the
	southeast trending reach of the Draft. The other five reports cover
	traverses upstream from the bend for a maximum of perhaps 3/4 mile (1.2 km),  although most of these were much shorter.<p>
		Our
	traverse downstream began at 10:00 AM on 10-19-98 under overcast and
	a sprinkle of rain that gave way in the afternoon to almost clear
	skies. As  is usual for this time of year, low water prevailed, and
	visible water occurred only at intervals where holes in the bed were
	deepest. However, springbrooks, some perhaps from diverted
	subsurface stream water in the thick boulder and cobble deposits of
	the bed, were common. Soils were generally sandy, reddish in color,
	and confined to favorably-located bars and banks. These soils were
	clearly of recent alluvial origin and quite rich in organic matter
	near the surface. Unlike that of mor soils, this organic matter had
	the appearance of incorporation into the mineral component by soil
	organisms.<p>
		The
	canopy in this section of a flood plain perhaps 300 feet  (91.5 m)
	in width, appeared to be dominated by Sycamore  (<i>Platanus 
	occidentalis</i>)  up to at least 27 inches  (0.69 m)  dbh.
	Associated with the Sycamore were White Pine to 26 inches  (0.66 m) 
	dbh, Canada Hemlock to 38 inches  (0.97 m),  Tuliptree (<i>Liriodendron  tulipifera </i>) to 35 inches  (o.89 m)  and one
	grand old Northern Red Oak veteran, leaning and hollow, with
	pronounced bark thickening on the underside. This tree had a
	measured diameter of 49 inches  (1.24 m).  Accompanying these large
	trees were abundant smaller Red and Sugar Maples  (<i>Acer  rubrum</i>
	and <i>A. saccharum</i>),  Black and Yellow Birches, Shagbark
	Hickory  (<i>Carya  ovata </i>), White Ash  (<i>Fraxinus  americana
	</i>), and scattered Black Gum  (<i>Nyssa  sylvatica</i>),  basswood
	intermediate between the American and White species  (<i>Tilia 
	americana</i> and <i>T.  heterophylla</i>),  Pignut Hickory  (<i>Carya
	 glabra</i> and/or <i>C. ovalis</i>),  Chestnut Oak,
	Sassafras  (<i>Sassafras  albidum</i>),  Cucumbertree  (<i>Magnolia 
	acuminata </i>), Black Locust  (<i>Robinia  pseudoacacia</i>)  and a
	few small Black Cherry  (<i>Prunus  serotina</i>).  Muscletree (<i>Carpinus  caroliniana </i>) was common in the understory, as were
	Striped Maple  (<i>Acer  pensylvanicum</i>)  and serviceberry,
	likely Downy  (<i>Amelanchier  arborea</i>).  The most common
	seedlings and saplings appeared to be those of Sugar Maple, with
	less of Red Maple, Northern Red Oak and Pignut Hickory. Hemlock
	saplings, mostly small, were common, and there were some seedlings
	as well. Little sign of the Hemlock Wooly Adelgid  (<i>Adelges 
	tsugae</i>) was seen [ this was found, in all likelihood, to be an
	inaccurate observation-see later ], and Hemlock was not much
	browsed by Deer. This appeared to be a very un-even-aged forest,
	with abundant large dead snags, and thus resembled old growth
	despite its proximity to the highway.<p>
		The
	most common large shrubs were Spice Bush (<i> Lindera  benzoin</i>) 
	and Witch Hazel (<i> Hamamelis  virginiana </i>), but Mountain
	Laurel was also frequent in places. Black Raspberry (<i> Rubus 
	occidentalis </i>), the alien but unobtrusive Wine Berry  (<i>R. 
	phoenicolasius </i>), as well as Coralberry  (<i>Symphoricarpos 
	orbiculatus </i>) were scattered throughout, but apparently confined
	to patches of fertile soil. Virginia Creeper  (<i>Parthenocissus </i>
	<i>quinquefolia </i>) and Poison Ivy  (<i>Rhus  radicans</i>)  were
	the most common vines, followed by Common Greenbrier  (<i>Smilax 
	rotundifolia </i>), occasional Summer Grape  (<i>Vitis  aestivalis
	</i>), Dutchman's Pipe vine  (<i>Aristolochia  macrophylla </i>) and
	a Dewberry  (<i>Rubus</i>  sp). <p>
		Christmas
	Fern  (<i>Polystichum</i> <i> acrostichoides</i>)  was almost
	omnipresent, but thinly distributed. Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia  punctilobula </i>) was common, and there were
	scattered Intermediate and Marginal Shield Ferns  (<i>Dryopteris 
	intermedia</i>   and <i>D.  marginalis </i>). White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium</i>  <i>rugosum</i>)  and Curtis Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago
	 curtisii </i>) appeared, at this season, to be the most conspicuous
	herbs and Partridge Berry  (<i>Mitchella  repens </i>) occurred
	frequently at shaded tree bases. A little Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila  maculata </i>) and Rattlesnake Plantain, likely Downy
	(<i> Goodyera </i> <i>pubescens</i>),  occurred in similar but
	perhaps dryer locations. Other herbs, some in a poor state of
	preservation, were an oat grass, likely Poverty  (<i>Danthonia 
	spicata</i>),  White Wood Aster  (<i>Aster  divaricatus</i>), 
	Calico Aster  (<i>A</i>. <i>lateriflorus</i>),  Black Cohosh (<i>
	Cimicifuga  racemosa</i>),  Deer-tongue Grass  (<i>Panicum 
	clandestinum </i>), the forest grass<i> Brachyelytrum erectum</i>,
	unidentified violets  (<i>Viola</i>  spp),  Canada Bromegrass (<i>Bromus  purgans </i>), the broad-leaved, glaucus forest sedge<i>
	Carex  platyphylla</i>, Foam Flower  (<i>Tiarella </i> <i>cordifolia</i>), Clearweed  (<i>Pilea  pumila </i>), Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium</i>  <i>triflorum</i>),  Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium</i> <i> purpureum </i>), a jewelweed  (<i>Impatiens </i>
	sp)  and Creeping Five-leaf  (<i>Potentilla  simplex/canadensis </i>).
	It is likely that these relative herb abundances would be different
	during the growing season, when many more species should be present.<p>
		Observations
	of bryophytes on this traverse was cursory. Apparently most common
	was Delicate Fern Moss  (<i>Thuidium  delicatulum </i>), which
	occurred widely on soil, dead wood and tree bases. Also frequent on
	soil was false haircap moss  (<i>Atrichum</i>  sp),  while
	unidentified species of <i>Mnium</i> occurred on a variety of sites,
	including soil, dead wood and tree bases. One or more species of the
	genus <i>Hypnum</i> appeared to be subordinate, but accompanied
	Delicate Fern Moss on rotting down boles and other mosses on soil.
	In dryer locations, such as the edges of high banks, there were
	cushions of the mosses <i>Dicranum</i>, including <i>Dicranum 
	scoparium</i>  and <i>Leucobryum</i>  on soil. In one place a <i>Hypnum</i>
	 and <i>Dicranum  scoparium</i>  formed discontinuous patches on an
	18 inch  (0.46 m)  diameter down bole of Hemlock. However few down
	boles completely or nearly completely covered by bryophytes were
	seen here, perhaps reflecting the relatively dry air conditions in
	this dominantly deciduous forest.<p>
		Yellow
	Birch observed in this forest were all small, usually not over 8
	inches  (o.2 m)  dbh, and were virtually restricted to the stream
	bank, possibly indicating that this species could find its requisite
	cool root temperatures only in this zone.<p>
		Katydids
	 (subfamily Pseudophyllinae)  called slowly and a very belligerent 2
	foot  (o.6 m)  Northern Water Snake  (<i>Nerodia  sipedon </i>) was
	encountered on the stream bank.<p>
		After
	the survey downstream from the bend, a short traverse was also made
	upstream during the afternoon. First noted was a vigorous vine of
	Summer Grape that bore large clusters of slightly glaucous blue
	grapes that exceeded one centimeter in diameter and which were quite
	sweet and flavorful. Also noted here, in colorful tall ranks along
	the stream, was Staghorn Sumac  (<i>Rhus  typhina</i>),  along with
	a little Wild Hydrangea  (<i>Hydrangea  arborescens</i>).  Within
	the adjacent forest Blunt-lobe Hepatica  (<i>Hepatica  americana </i>)
	and Calico Aster were common, and there was a number of small White
	Oak  (<i>Quercus  alba</i>)  saplings, the first of this oak seen. A
	spot inventory also yielded Tuliptree, White Pine, Hemlock, Sugar
	Maple, including a 36 inch  (0.91 m)  dbh veteran, Black Birch,
	Shagbark Hickory, Northern Red Oak, a very little White Oak,
	Muscletree, Mountain Laurel and <i>Thuidium  </i>and <i>Hypnum</i> 
	mosses.<p>
		A
	little farther upstream, near the east bank, in a canopy gap, was a
	group of small, vigorous Hemlock saplings that, even after careful
	examination, showed no sign of the Adelgid. Nearby, also in the
	opening, were Mountain Laurel, Teaberry, Carrion Flower  (<i>Smilax 
	herbacea</i>),  Christmas Fern, Ground Pine  (<i>Lycopodium 
	flabelliforme </i>), <i>Leucobryum</i> moss and <i>Cladina</i> 
	lichen. Also seen in the vicinity was a single shrub of Mountain
	Holly, a small Black Oak  (<i>Quercus  velutina</i>)  sapling,
	Slender-flowered Muhly grass  (<i>Muhlenbergia </i> <i>tenuiflora </i>),
	possible Woodland Muhly  (<i>M.  sylvatica </i>), a 32 inch  (0.82 m) dbh Northern Red Oak with abundant acorns and Marginal Shield
	Fern. Here also Katydids called with the slow cadence of cool
	weather.<p>
		Still
	farther upstream on the flood plain were Intermediate Shield Fern,
	basswood, and on soil, a small isolated patch of Tree Moss (<i>Climacium </i> <i>americanum</i>),   Then crossing the Wilderness
	boundary, Yellow Birch and more of the intermediate basswood were
	seen near the stream's west bank. These were followed by more
	Intermediate Shield Fern, Yellow Birch and Wild Hydrangea.<p>
		Noted
	on the return traverse near here were abundant White Snakeroot,
	Common Greenbrier and a single Black Haw Viburnum  (<i>Viburnum </i>
	<i>prunifolium</i>).  Farther along the return traverse, and again
	outside the Wilderness boundary, the trail passed close to the
	western edge of the flood plain, where there is an extensive
	exposure and a low cliff of red sandstone. Here active seeps
	resulted in a more luxuriant flora than elsewhere in the vicinity,
	with Flowering Raspberry (<i> Rubus  odoratus</i>),  Wild Hydrangea
	and diverse tall herbs including Slender-flowered and Woodland
	Muhlies, as well as many others that were unrecognizable at this
	season. Here also were several small Yellow Birch growing at the
	cliff top, precisely where a seep persisted during the dry
	conditions prevailing at the time. The location of these Yellow
	Birch again confirmed the close dependence of this tree on cool,
	moist conditions- which in this valley only persist in certain
	microhabitats.<p>
		Also
	noted on the return traverse were Indian Turnip  (<i>Arisaema </i>
	<i>triphyllum</i>),  Crooked -stem Aster  (<i>Aster  prenanthoides</i>), Saw Brier (<i> Smilax </i> <i>glauca </i>) and the call of a
	Pileated Woodpecker  (<i>Dryocopus  pileatus </i>). In one place, in
	a deep stream-eroded pit, not far from the trail, there was, in
	association with lush Intermediate Shield Fern, a single bush of Red
	Elderberry  (<i>Sambucus  pubens</i>)  amidst large woody debris. We
	will have occasion to refer to this location again in our report on
	other traverses.<p>
		An
	impression gained by comparing the foregoing traverse with that
	which extended downstream, is the relative scarcity of Sycamore and
	Coralberry upstream from the bend. If real, this feature may
	indicate that more available nutrients, perhaps in part originating
	from limestone gravels in the bed of Route 250, may have influenced
	the flora below the bend.<p>
		Next
	reported on here is an inventory conducted on 4-30-94. Although this
	was during the early growing season, when many plants were emerging,
	our inventory was cursory. However identified immediately upstream
	from the bend were Dwarf Ginseng  (<i>Panax  trifolius </i>), Wild
	Geranium  (<i>Geranium </i> <i>maculatum</i>),  Smooth Yellow Violet
	 (<i>Viola  pensylvanica</i>)  and Sweet White Violet  (<i>Viola 
	blanda</i>),  all in bloom. Also seen were an unidentified Trillium,
	White Wood Aster and Miterwort  (<i>Mitella  diphylla </i>), and
	farther upstream under Hemlock, Canada Mayflower  (<i>Maianthemum 
	canadense</i>),  Common Speedwell  (<i>Veronica  officinalis </i>),
	Gay Wings  (<i>Polygala  paucifolia </i>) and Wood Anemone  (<i>Anemone
	 quinqefolia </i>), with the last two also in bloom.<p>
		Of
	particular interest on this day were the fauna observed. These
	included the first Scarlet Tanager  (<i>Piranga  olivacea </i>) and
	Red-eyed Vireo  (<i>Vireo  olivaceus </i>) of the year, but most
	particularly a close look at Blackburnian Warblers  (<i>Dendroica 
	fusca </i>), which were active in low shrubbery. According to
	Robbins  (1996),  this warbler is frequently associated with old
	growth Hemlock, a forest type that occurs just upstream in the
	Draft. Also seen on this day were efts of the Eastern Newt (
	<i>Notophthalmus  viridescens</i>)  emerging from small ponds in the
	woods.<p>
		Our
	inventory of 5-3-94 was again confined to the area extending
	upstream from the bend to the vicinity of the red sandstone outcrop
	on the west side of the flood plain. The weather was cool, somewhat
	windy and gradually clouded over. A high point of this inventory was
	discovering a few plants of blooming Star Flower  (<i>Trientalis 
	borealis </i>) under Hemlock. On this day also the Red Elderberry
	mentioned previously was in bloom. Other species identified for the
	first time were Long-spurred Violet  (<i>Viola  rostrata</i>),  also
	in bloom, Wild Ginger  (<i>Asarum </i> <i>canadense </i>),
	Interrupted Fern  (<i>Osmunda </i> <i>claytoniana </i>), Hairy
	Disporum (<i> Disporum  lanuginosum</i>),  Golden Ragwort  (<i>Senecio
	 aureus</i>),  Wild Liquorice (<i> Galium  circaezans </i>), Dotted
	St. Johns-wort  (<i>Hypericum  punctatum</i>),  the wood rush <i>Luzula
	 acuminata,</i> Adam's Needle  (<i>Yucca  filamentosa</i>)   the
	alien Corn Speedwell  (<i>Veronica  arvensis</i>)  and White Wood
	Sorrel  (<i>Oxalis  montana</i>).  The Woodland Strawberry (<i>Fragaria  vesca </i>) encountered here was not categorized as
	either native or alien.  Similarly, the profusely-blooming bluets
	could have been either Spring  (<i>Houstonia  caerulea </i>) or
	Thyme-leaved  (<i>H.  serpyllifolia </i>).<p>
		Fauna
	seen on this day included large  (1.5 cm)  mayflies  (Family
	Heptageniidae)  on vegetation near the stream, a Belted Kingfisher (<i>Megaceryle  alcyon</i>),  as well as Scarlet Tanagers.<p>
		On
	a brief return to the same area on 5-10-94, the following were added
	to our tally: Wild Pink  (<i>Silene  pensylvanica</i>),  with
	flowers very light pink to white in color, Kidney-leaf Crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus  abortivus </i>), Smooth Rockcress  (<i>Arabis 
	laevigata</i>),  possible Goldie's Shield Fern  (<i>Dryopteris </i>
	<i>goldiana</i>)  and, under Hemlock, Round-leaf Violet  (<i>Viola 
	rotundifolia</i>). <p>
		Accompaning
	fauna included Swallowtail (<i> Papilio</i>  sp)  butterflies, a
	high-flying <i>Buteo</i>, Turkey Vultures  (<i>Cathartes  aura</i>), Scarlet Tanagers, vireos and unidentified warblers.<p>
		Our
	inventory of 11-10-98 consisted of a traverse upstream from the bend
	for approximately 3/4 mile  (1.21 km)  and terminated in relatively
	undisturbed old growth forest on the east side of the flood plain.
	One objective of this inventory was to characterize the distribution
	of bryophytes in various microhabitats. To this end specimens were
	examined with the microscope by R. Hunsucker.<p>
		The
	weather during the traverse was cool, with an initially heavy mist
	draping the mountains. The stream was as low or lower than it was on
	the 10-19-98 visit, and a pH determination of water from one of the
	deep holes yielded a value of 5.3. In one place, just above the
	bend, a large berry-laden Poke  (<i>Phytolacca  americana</i>) 
	plant grew in the rocky stream bed, while nearby the bracket fungus
	<i>Ganoderma  tsugae</i>  was found on a down Hemlock. Here also, in
	what proved to be one of the few bird sightings of the day, a small
	flock of Juncos  (<i>Junco  hyemalis</i>)  foraged among the
	undergrowth. 
	<p>	Continuing
	along the trail on the west side of the flood plain, we came upon
	the dried remains of Columbine  (<i>Aquilegia  canadensis</i>),  a
	species frequently associated with limestone and fertile soils. Here
	it occurred in dark, organic loam very near the trail. In close
	proximity we also found Sweet Cicely, likely Hairy (<i> Osmorhiza 
	claytoni</i>),  Blue Wood Aster  (<i>Aster  cordifoius</i>)  and a
	fungus of the genus <i>Pholiota</i>. We then encountered a large
	down bole on which we identified the following mosses: <i>Campylium</i>
	<i> chrysophyllum</i>, Delicate Fern Moss, <i>Mnium  affine</i>  var
	 <i>ciliare</i>, <i>Entodon  cladorrhizans</i>, <i>Anomodon  minor
	</i>and <i>A.  attenuatus</i>. Associated with these was the
	liverwort <i>Porella </i> <i>platyphylla. </i> On an adjacent down
	bole was the moss<i> Platygyrium  repens  </i>and on a live standing
	Shagbark Hickory <i>Ulota  crispa  </i>and <i>Anomodon  attenuatus</i>.<p>
		We
	had now arrived at the Red Elderberry bush seen on our previous
	traverses and which stood in the midst of a number of rotting,
	moss-covered down boles. Identified here were <i>Platygyrium 
	repens</i>, <i>Hypnum  curvifolium</i>, <i>H.  cupressiforme</i>,
	<i>Entodon  cladorrhizans</i>, <i>Mnium  affine </i> var <i> ciliare</i>
	 and <i>Brachythecium  salebrosum</i>.<p>
		Next
	seen along the trail was that familiar of acid trail banks, Wheat
	Moss  (<i>Diphyscium  foliosum </i>), here on soil under Hemlock and
	Black Birch. Not far beyond however, we came upon a single small
	patch of Tree Moss, a species frequently associated with rich soils
	and the only occurrence of this species seen on the traverse. It is
	even possible that this was the same occurrence as that seen on the
	10-19-98 traverse. Other mosses seen on rock and soil in the
	vicinity were <i>Hedwigia  ciliata</i>, a species frequently seen on
	sandstone, <i>Anomodon</i> <i> attenuatus</i>, and Delicate Fern
	Moss. Also noted was the thallus liverwort <i>Metzgeria  furcata</i>.<p>
		We
	now approached the aforementioned large outcrop of red sandstone,
	where we noted the strongly acidiphile Apple Moss  (<i>Bartramia 
	pomiformis </i>) and, in the open on virtually bare rock, the only
	haircap moss  (<i>Polytrichum</i> sp)  seen during all our traverses
	in this valley. From the shape of its field-observed capsules, this
	may have been <i>Polytrichum  ohioense</i>, Here also, in a small
	shaded ravine that cut the adjacent slope, we found a tiny red eft
	of the Eastern Newt, quite stiff from the cold.<p>
		Then
	crossing an open stretch of cobble, we saw scattered remains of
	Southern Bellflower (<i> Campanula  divaricata </i>), Woodland Muhly
	and two species of Evening Primrose, namely Common  (<i>Oenothera 
	biennis </i>) and possibly Narrow-leaved Sundrops  (<i>O.  fruticosa</i>). 
	In company with these was the moss  <i>Rhynchostegium 
	serrulatum</i>.<p>
		We
	presently arrived at the sandstone cliff with active seeps and
	associated Yellow Birch and the mesic flora described previously.
	Mosses on this cliff appeared to be dominated by species of
	<i>Amblystegium</i>,  (including <i>A</i>.  <i>tenax</i>),  
	<i>Philonotus</i>,   (including <i>P.  marchia  </i>and <i>P. 
	fontana</i>)  and Delicate Fern Moss, with some Apple Moss.<p>
		Advancing
	along the trail, we came to a derelict Game Commission building
	under large White Pine, and under these grew Spotted Wintergreen and
	Roundlobe Hepatica. However, only a little beyond the Pines, we saw
	the uncommon Millet Grass  (<i>Milium  effusum</i>),  that is
	usually found on fertile soils and/or at high elevations and is
	listed as rare by the Virginia Division of Natural Heritage. Here
	this grass grew under Hemlock, White Oak, White Pine, Black Birch
	and Red Maple at the edge of the trail-from which it may have
	derived nutrients.  (We were to learn later that it is a common
	grass in this valley.)<p>
		Seen
	next in our progress upstream were Broad-glumed Brome Grass  (<i>Bromus
	 latiglumis </i>), and on a down bole covered by a heavy growth of
	the mosses, <i>Mnium, Thuidium</i>  and <i>Anomodon</i>. Also seen
	here was a large moss-covered Sugar Maple with the lower trunk
	occupied by <i>Anomodon</i>  (likely <i>A</i>.  <i>attenuatus</i> 
	and/or <i>A. minor</i>)  and, farther up the trunk, by <i>Forsstroemia
	</i> <i>trichomitria</i>. Growing with these mosses was the fungus
	<i>Usttulina  deusta</i>, a species usually found on dead wood.<p>
		After
	entering the Wilderness, we crossed the virtually dry stream bed to
	the east side of the flood plain. Here the forest was less disturbed
	by stream action and human activities, and much of it is mature if
	not old growth. Also present was a small branch or springbrook
	flowing semi-parallel to and eventually joining Ramsey's Draft. The
	forest canopy here at first consisted of quite large but not huge
	Hemlock and Tuliptree and smaller Black Birch. There were few
	shrubs, but Intermediate Shield Fern was conspicuous and Delicate
	Fern Moss and species of <i>Hypnum</i>  appeared to occur mostly on
	rocks and down boles respectively. Moving up-valley beside the
	springbrook, we encountered more large Hemlock, smaller Yellow
	Birch, and based on fallen leaves, a little White Basswood. Mosses
	found on the bark of a large leaning Yellow Birch included <i>Ulota 
	crispa</i>, <i>Brotherella  recurvans  </i>and an unidentified
	<i>Dicranum</i>. A rotted down bole was covered by the liverwort
	<i>Nowellia  curvifolia</i>. On a high bank close to the Draft a
	number of 10 foot  (3 m)  Beech saplings were conspicuous by virtue
	of the yellow leaves they retained.<p>
		Plants
	in the immediate vicinity of the springbrook were diverse, even at
	this sason. <i>Carex  scabrata</i>  dominated but was accompanied by
	Golden Saxifrage  (<i>Chrysosplenium  americanum </i>), Turtle head
	 (<i>Chelone  glabra </i>), tall, vigorous Blue Monkshood  (<i>Aconitum
	 uncinatum</i>)  and Mad-dog Skullcap  (<i>Scutellaria  lateriflora
	</i>). In a pool were  unidentified species of the liverwort
	<i>Scapania  </i>and the aquatic moss <i>Fontinalis</i>, while wet
	rocks bore the uncommon moss <i>Racomitrium  aciculare</i>, a
	species said to be widespread in northern and montane regions of
	Europe and North America  (Crum and Anderson,1981).  Here Yellow
	Birch in association with large Hemlock and a lone White Ash
	appeared to have the greatest abundance seen by us thus far. Also
	showing its greatest abundance was Intermediate Shield Fern. Other
	still conspicuous herbs in dryer spots were browned Hay-scented
	Fern, White Snakeroot, <i>Brachyelytrum</i> <i>erectum</i>, the
	woodrush<i> Luzula  acuminata</i>  and a small patch of Shining
	Clubmoss (<i> Lycopodium  lucidulum</i>)  under Hemlock. Here also
	was a patch of numerous separate dried culms of Slender-flowered
	Muhly. A Sugar Maple bore a community of the mosses <i>Neckera  
	pennata</i>, <i>Forsstroemia </i> <i>trichomitria</i>  and an
	unidentified <i>Heterocladium</i>.<p>
		In
	the cooler, moister mature and old growth forest, bryophytes appear
	to be more abundant than in the more deciduous forest downstream
	from the bend and unlike in their mode of occurrence as well. Here
	down boles are frequently enveloped by bryophytes, while downstream
	coverage is usually patchy. Here also, <i>Hypnum</i>  appears to be
	more common, and ascends tree bases and lower trunks, whereas
	downstream it appears to be more restricted to down boles and soil.<p>
		While
	few fungi were seen in this late and dry season, our attention was
	drawn to a <i>Pholiota  aurivella</i>  that grew within a hollowed
	out Beech  (<i>Fagus  grandifolia</i>). <p>
		The
	following is a summary of bryophytes collected on this traverse and
	identified under the microscope by R. Hunsucker, with the assistance
	of Dana Griffin. Liverworts are explicitly indicated and mosses
	constitute the rest. *= species not found on the calcareous terrain
	at Blowing Springs  (see <a href=blows.htm>our section on Blowing Springs</a>).  It should
	be kept in mind however, that these differences may be an artifact
	of our far from comprehensive studies.<p>

<ul>
 <p>
	These
	inventories added 44 species to our tally and established further
	soil and phenological characteristics.<p>
	Our
	inventory traverse of 5-16-99 began at 9:30 AM under clear cool
	conditions. It extended from the Wilderness parking lot up-valley on
	the Valley's west side and  was centered between the stream and the
	edge of the flood plain. After noting that Ramsey's Draft flowed
	quite strongly, the following  species were recorded sequentially in
	the up-valley direction: Alternate-leaf Dogwood  (<i>Cornus 
	alternifolia</i>),  Thyme-leaved Bluets, Plantain-leaf Pussytoes (
	<i>Antennaria  plantaginifolia</i>),  <i>Carex  laxiflora</i>, C<i>.
	pensylvanica</i>, the aliens Orchard Grass<i>  (Dactylis  glomerata</i>) and Canada Bluegrass (<i> Poa  compressa</i>),  White Wood Aster,
	Blunt-lobe Hepatica and Christmas Fern, the last six being located
	under a large White Pine. These Were followed by Black Raspberry,
	abundant Poison Ivy and Virginia Creeper, Partridge Berry in bloom,
	Rattlesnake Fern  (<i>Botrychium virginianum</i>),  Virginia 
	Waterleaf (<i> Hydrophyllum  virginianum</i>),  Wild Ginger, the
	call of a Red-eyed Vireo, Hispid Greenbrier  (<i>Smilax  hispida</i>), Choke Cherry (<i> Prunus</i>  <i>virginiana </i>), a yellow
	swallowtail butterfly, Canada Mayflower in bloom, Hemlock with some
	sign of the Adelgid, a cluster of Red Elderberry bushes, Wood Nettle
	 (<i>Laportea canadensis </i>), seedlings and saplings of White Ash,
	<i>Carex  leptonervia </i> (a sedge characteristic of &quot;rich
	maple woods&quot; according to Strausbaugh and Core,   (1977), 
	Flowering Dogwood  (<i>Cornus  florida</i>)  in a rare appearance,
	common Woodland Strawberry, also in bloom, Black Cohosh and
	Intermediate Shield Fern in abundance. Encountered now was an area
	of microtopographic roughness with hummocks of a meter amplitude or
	so. A young but mature canopy consisted of Hemlock, White Pine,
	Sugar and Red Maples, American Basswood, Black Locust, White Ash and
	Sycamore. A sapling of Yellow Birch was also seen. Shrubs and vines
	were Red Elderberry, Flowering Raspberry, Virginia Creeper, Poison
	Ivy and Dutchman's Pipe vine. These were accompanied by a rich herb
	flora comprised of a number of vigorous tussocks of flowering Millet
	Grass, Intermediate Shield and Christmas Ferns, Sensitive Fern (<i>Onoclea  sensibiis</i>),  Sweet White Violet in bloom, a
	jewelweed  (<i>Impatiens</i>  sp),  White Wood Sorrel, <i>Potentilla
	 simplex</i>, Curtis Goldenrod, Cleavers  (<i>Galium  aperine </i>),
	White Wood Aster, an avens   (<i>Geum </i> sp),  Allegheny Crowfoot
(<i>Ranunculus  allegheniensis</i>),  Hispid Buttercup  (<i>R.
	hispidus</i>)  and Miterwort. A little up-Valley from this community
	there was Spice Bush, Nodding Fescue  (<i>Festuca  obtusa),</i>Enchanter's Nightshade  (<i>Circaea  quadrisulcata</i>)  and
	Wild Geranium in bloom.<p>
		An area was now entered where the stream flowed close to the flood
	plain's western edge, so our traverse was along the base of the
	steep bounding slope.Noted here were Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Downy
	Many Knees  (<i>Polygonatum  pubescens </i>), Early Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga</i>  <i>virginiensis </i>), Long-spurred Violet, Dwarf
	Ginseng, Great Chickweed, One-flowered Broomrape   (<i>Orobanche
	uniflora</i>), and  the woodrush <i>Luzula  acuminata</i>, with the
	last six all in bloom. A 1/3 inch   (0.8 cm)  metallic green wild
	bee patronized flowers of Wild Geranium. These were followed In
	close proximity to the stream by Hog Peanut, Deer-tongue Grass (<i>Panicum  cladestinum</i>),  Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel <i>(Oxalis
	 stricta </i>), blooming Smooth Yellow Violet, Muscletree and a
	single bush of Buffalonut  (<i>Pyrularia </i> <i>pubesens </i>). A 
	tiny springbrook  that  entered the stream from a ravine contained
	small  (~0.5 cm)  black pollywogs, likely of a tree frog.<p>
		A brief
	foray on the morning of 5-22-99 again extended up-valley from the
	wilderness parking lot, but was confined to the trailside at the
	base of the steep western valley slope. Initially the weather was
	mostly sunny, but it soon clouded up and the traverse was terminated
	due to rain at about 1:30 PM.<p>
		Many
	birds appeared to be about. Calls of the Red-eyed Vireo were almost
	incessant and those of the Scarlet Tanager frequent, Numerous small
	unidentified birds, likely warblers, were in the canopy. The stream
	was markedly lower than a week earlier and the small springbrook
	observed then still contained small dark pollywogs, but had shrunk
	substantially in volume of flow. Spittlebugs were common on Poison
	Ivy, White Ash and Curtis Goldenrod and a number of large Tiger
	Swallowtail Butterflies  (<i>Papilio  glaucus</i>)  were observed.<p>
		Plants
	identified were Hairy Sweet Cicely,<i> Carex  rosea</i>, <i>C. 
	leptonervia</i>, <i>C.  platyphylla</i> and, on a large hummock, the
	mosses<i> Atrichum  undulatum</i> and a species of <i>Mnium</i>
	,with White Wood Sorrel coming into bloom. Also noted at the base of
	the steep slope were lush vines of Four-leaved Yam, Indian
	Cucumberroot  (<i>Medeola  virginiana </i>)<i>, </i>Wood Anemone and
	Canada Violet  (<i>Viola  Canadensis) </i>,  with the latter more
	than a foot tall and in bloom.<p>
	The
	inventory of 6-7-99 consisted of two traverses, one each in the
	morning and afternoon. Both were along the flood  plain's western
	edge adjacent  to the familiar trail to the sandstone cliff and
	beyond. Only the second extended into the designated wilderness and
	then only for a short distance. The weather was mostly clear with
	more clouds in the afternoon. Temperatures were uncomfortably high
	even among Hemlock, and conditions were quite dry. The stream flow
	was a good bit lower than on our May visit.<p>
		When
	we left the Shenandoah Valley on this day the periodic cicada   
	(<i>Magicicada  septendecium</i>)  filled the forest with their
	calls. However,  here we heard what appeared to be of the order of
	only ten calls all day. No doubt this was a consequence at least in
	part of the stony and relatively infertile soils in this valley.
	Those heard to call were of the dominant high-pitched calling race.<p>
		Noted
	successively as we moved up-valley on the morning traverse were
	Canada Brome Grass, the call of a Great Crested Flycatcher (<i>Myiarchus  crinitus</i>),  Allegheny Blackberry, the generally
	dense ground flora that included Nodding Fescue, Black Cohosh with
	flower buds forming, abundant Poke Milkweed  (<i>Asclepias  exaltata</i>), as well as other unidentified milkweeds, Hairy Disporum coming
	into bloom, <i>Carex </i> <i>leptonervia</i> and the calls of
	unidentified birds.<p>
		On
	arriving at the red sandstone outcrop, a more ample flow of the
	stream than downstream was apparent, a result no doubt of the solid
	bedrock forcing the water to the surface. Here also the call of a
	Red-eyed Vireo was heard, while exhibited on the steep bank were the
	flamboyant purple blooms of Gray Beardtongue  (<i>Penstemon 
	canescens</i>),  and,  on the adjacent flat, as first noted on our
	11-10-98 traverse, Common Evening Primrose, now also in full bloom.<p>
		At
	the sandstone cliff our continuing tally of the flora included
	Sycamore, Black Locust, abundant Staghorn Sumac, Wild Hydrangea,
	Flowering Raspberry and Allegheny Blackberry  (<i>Rubus 
	allegheniensis</i>),  both in bloom, Black Raspberry in fruit,
	Poison Ivy, Summer Grape with numerous clusters of blossoms, Poke
	Milkweed, possible White Milkweed (<i>Asclepias</i>  <i>varigata</i>), Millet Grass, Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed, a jewelweed (<i>Impatiens</i>
	 sp),  Nodding Fescue, Cleavers, Hog Peanut  (<i>Amphicarpa 
	bracteata</i>),  Canada Brome Grass, White Wood Aster, Goat's Beard
	 (<i>Aruncus  dioicus</i>)  and Columbine, with the last two in
	bloom. Also present was Virginia Strawberry  (<i>Fragaria 
	virginiana</i>)  with fruit, but of an inferior quality to that from
	limestone terrain. <i>Carex scabrata</i> grew at the stream's edge
	and an Ovenbird  (<i> Seiurus  aurocapillus</i>) called.<p><spacer type=horizontal size=0>
		The
	springbrook reported on earlier still contained pollywogs, as did
	the adjacent stream pools, and those in the latter were now of the
	order of 0.5 inch  (1.3 cm)  in length, although those in the
	springbrook were smaller.<p>
		The
	afternoon traverse extended our inventory beyond the red sandstone
	cliff, on which a brief glimpse was caught of what appeared to be a
	Fence Lizard (<i> Scleoporus  undulatus</i>). Not far beyond the
	outcrop there was Woodland Sunflower  (<i>Helianthus </i>
	<i>divaricatus</i>)  not yet in bloom, Wine Berry and an
	unidentified milkweed.<p>
		Following
	the trail/woods road, the derelict State Game Commission building
	encountered on our 11-10-98 traverse was again passed. A short
	distance along the trail the exciting discovery was made of
	brightly-blooming Golden-knees  (<i>Chrysogonum </i> <i>virginianum</i>), a monotypic species endemic to the Appalachians and a few
	adjacent areas. Accompanying scattered plants of this species were
	abundant Woodland Strawberry and<i> Potentilla  simplex</i>, both in
	bloom, common Millet Grass and a little Virginia Waterleaf with
	fading flowers that were being patronized by a metallic green
	hymenopteran similar to that observed earlier on Wild Geranium.
	These were followed farther along the trail by the blue-eyed grass<i>
	Sisyrinchium  mucronatum,</i> abundant seedlings of Sugar Maple,
	patches of<i> Carex  pensylivanica </i>around tree bases,<i> Carex </i>
	<i>sparganioides</i>, <i>C.  squarrosa</i> and the call of a Scarlet
	Tanager. 
	<p>	As
	the trail ran close to the stream once more, a flow strong enough to
	prevent easy fording was again apparent. Here also the designated
	Wilderness was entered as a few individual cicadas called. Of
	particular interest was the subsequent observation of a single foot
	 (0.3 m) -high seedling or sapling of Mountain Ash, the first of
	this species ever seen by us below the highland summits in this
	region of the forest. In association were still vigorous but
	Adelgid-infested Hemlock, Yellow Birch, Wild Hydrangea and Marginal
	and Intermediate Shield Ferns. As the traverse was terminated, a
	Scarlet Tanager again called.<p>
		Our
	8-2-00 visit began under cloudy skies and spitting rain. The major
	objective this day was to better characterize the soils of the lower
	Draft, but was confined to the area a little upstream from the
	Wilderness parking lot. It was initiated by sampling the stream
	water, for which a pH of 5.6 was obtained.<p>
		The
	first soil sample  (no 1)  was taken not far from the trail in the
	vicinity of a concentration of Millet Grass from a three inch  (8 cm) depth. Other species in the immediate vicinity were Sugar and Red
	Maples, White Ash, Adelgid infested Hemlock, Spice Bush, White Wood
	Aster and a patch of unidentified <i>Atrichum</i> moss. This soil, a
	brown sandy loam with well incorporated organic matter, had a pH of
	5.4 both initially and 23 hours later.<p>
		The
	next soil sample  (no 2)  was taken- amidst active mosquitoes- from
	the base of the rich colluvial slope near the trail. This sample was
	rich in organic matter and dark in color. Plants in the vicinity of
	the sample included White Ash, Northern Red Oak, Witch Hazel, Poison
	Ivy, Hog Peanut, Horse Balm  (<i>Collinsonia  canadensis</i>), 
	Hairy Disporum, Christmas Fern, Marginal Shield Fern, Curtis
	Goldenrod, White Wood Aster and an Avens (<i> Geum </i> sp).  An
	initial pH of 5.3 was obtained, but 23 hours later it had changed to
	5.6.<p>
		The
	stream was now crossed to the east side and a soil sample  (no 3) 
	collected from a 2-3 inch depth in a semi-opening and in a luxuriant
	stand of Coral Berry. Other species in the vicinity included
	Sycamore, Sugar Maple, White Pine, Striped Maple, Virginia Creeper,
	an unidentified dewberry and Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed. Values of pH
	obtained were 5.7 initially and 5.5 twenty- three hours later.<p>
		Soil
	sample no 4 was taken from a 2-3 inch depth under a 28 inch  (0.67 m) dbh American Basswood in close proximity to Canada Mayflower.
	Other species in the vicinity were White Ash, Sugar Maple, White
	Pine, Striped Maple, Poison Ivy, Dutchman's Pipe vine, Ebony
	Spleenwort  (<i>Asplenium </i> <i>platyneuron </i>), White Wood
	Aster, Black Cohosh and Creeping Five-leaf. This sample yielded a pH
	of 5.4 initially and 5.0 twenty-three hours later.<p>
		Returning
	to the west side of the stream, a soil sample  (no 5)  was taken
	from next to a plant of Columbine. This Columbine, which was
	inventoried on our 11-10-98 visit, was located close to the trail
	under a one foot  (0.3 m)  dbh White Pine and a 22 inch  (0.56 m) 
	dbh American Basswood. Associates were White Ash, Poison Ivy,
	Dutchman's Pipe vine, Virginia Creeper, Hispid Greenbrier, Poke
	Milkweed, White Wood Aster, Hairy Sweet Cicely, Calico Aster, White
	Avens  (<i>Geum </i> <i>canadense </i>), Creeping Five-leaf and a
	patch of an unidentified species of <i>Mnium </i>moss. This sample,
	taken from a 2-3 inch depth and rich in organic matter, had an
	initial pH of 6.7 and 23 hours later this had increased to 7.6. It
	is possible that these values result in part from limestone gravel
	on the trail,  with reaction continuing over time.<p>
		Along
	the cliff area of the flood plain's western edge Southern
	Bellflower, Spotted Jewelweed  (<i>Impatiens  capensis</i>)  and
	Thin-leaved Sunflower  (<i>Helianthus  decapetalus</i>)  were in
	full bloom. A soil sample  (no 6)  was taken from the bank below the
	Yellow Birch referred to in our 10-19-98 traverse. This sample
	consisted of sticky yellow clay from the seep, which flowed on
	shale. It was low in organic matter and formed such hard lumps on
	drying that they could not be broken up with the fingers. No initial
	pH could be obtained due to suspended clay. However a determination
	made 23 hours later yielded a good value of 4.7.<p>
		Small
	lepidoptera were generally abundant everywhere and large ones such
	as Swallowtails were common as well. An inch-diameter land snail was
	also seen in the cliff area.<p>

	conditions this day included mild temperatures and overcast skies
	that cleared about !:00 PM. Trees on slopes were leafing out and a
	number of plants such as Bloodroot and Miterwort were budding, Early
	Saxifrage was in bloom and Canada Mayflower and May Apple (<i>Podophyllum  peltatum</i>)  were leafing out. A good number of
	small birds, some with yellow feathers, and probably warblers, were
	active in the canopy and shrubbery. It should also be mentioned that
	contrary to an earlier  (1998)  impression, the apparent effect of
	the Hemlock Wooly  Adelgid is very great in this forest,
	particularly in the form of a thinned canopy and dead large trees.<p>
	Our first
	station, reached at about 11:00, was located about 1/5 mile  (0.3 km) southeast of the Mountain House picnic ground on the west side of
	the flood plain, under a 10 inch  (0.25 m)  dbh Yellow Birch. Canada
	Mayflower was a conspicuous ground cover. Taken at a depth of 6
	inches in dark organic soil, the temperature reading  (T-18)  was
	T = 9.5 deg C, after about five minutes stabilization time. It
	should be mentioned that this station is in an area in which Hemlock
	have been profoundly defoiated.<p>
		The
	second station, perhaps 10 meters from the first, was at what would
	prove to be a deep source spring. A water temperature reading  (T -
	19)  here was T = 8.0 deg C after rapid equilibration.<p>
		The
	third station was perhaps some hundreds of feet east of the first,
	and virtually on the bank of Ramsey's Draft. The location, also
	under a clump of Yellow Birch, was in very stony soil, and the
	measurement  (T-20),  resulted in T = 11.0 deg C at a depth of 4
	inches  (10 cm). <p>
		We now
	returned to the picnic ground vicinity and from there continued up -
	valley, Our next station  (no 4)  was located just west of the trail
	under a mature Shagbark Hickory in very stony soil. A measurement (T-21)  yielded T = 10.0 deg C after equilibration.<p>
		Our
	fifth station, unlike those previously occupied, was at the base of
	the mountain slope or western valley side and had an easterly
	aspect. The site, described in our 8-2-00 inventory and pH
	determination, is in rich colluvium, resulted in a reading  (T-22) of T = 12.5 deg C.<p>
		Continuing
	up-valley, we arrived at the extensive outcrop of red sandstone
	and a small seep that originates  in the base of the mountain slope
	or valley side. Determination  (T-23)  of the water temperature of
	this seep resulted in a value of T = 11.0 deg C. Of interest here
	also was the presence of a large, dark unidentified salamander.<p>
		A little
	beyond the seep we noted Wild Pink, here in truly pink bloom, as
	distinguished from the white phase seen elsewhere on the flood
	plain. Then, beyond the red cliff, we established a station at a low
	point, under a 5 inch  (0.13 m)  dbh Yellow Birch that emitted a
	very cold sap from a wound. The soil temperature  (T-24)  was
	found to be T = 10 0 deg C.<p>
		Moving
	up-valley again along the trail, we observed what may have been a
	Coal Skink  (<i>Eumeces  anthracinus</i>).  Then, just south of the
	derelict Game Commission building, our next station was chosen among
	Mountain Laurel and blooming  Blunt-lobe Hepatica just west of the
	trail. A temperature  (T-25)  of T = 9.0 deg C was obtained.<p>
		Our last
	soil temperature station was located a little north of the
	Wilderness boundary, where the trail pinched out between the
	mountain slope and the flood plain. and in the vicinity of where on
	a 6-7-99 survey we had seen a seedling of Mountain Ash. The
	reading  (T-26),  in rich-appearing organic soil among Millet
	Grass, was T = 10.0 deg C.<p>
		Two
	additional water temperature readings were made on our return down -
	valley. The first  (T-27),  was of a branch stream that enters the
	Draft just north of the picnic ground. A temperature T = 11.0 deg C
	was obtained. The second  (T-28),  was of the Draft itself, which
	had T = 10.0 deg C.<p>

	<p>A
	major objective on this walk again was the determination of soil and
	water temperatures. To see the result the reader is referred to our
	&quot;Soil Temperature and Forest Type.&quot; The spread in soil
	temperatures this day was only 12.0-13.0 or one deg C.<p>
		Other
	observations included the relatively infrequent occurrence of
	Bloodroot, the common occurrence of Wood nettle and Horse Balm in
	moist areas, the first noted Crooked-stem Aster in these areas as
	well, and the presence of Virginia Waterleaf with white blooms. An
	impression was also gained of the rather more common than previously
	thought occurrence of Red Elderberry, Summer Grape, Shagbark
	Hickory, White Ash, Woodland Strawberry and White Pine saplings. The
	infrequent occurrence of Flowering Dogwood was again noted.<p>
		Birds 
	recorded either visually or by ear included Red-eyed Vireos,
	possibly other vireos, Scarlet Tanagers and a  number of Ovenbirds.
	Fish were seen rising in a pool at about 2:30 PM and midges-some
	biting- as well as mosquitoes were common.<p>
		An
	impression was also gained of the pervasive defoliation of Hemlock,
	especially the larger trees, but also of a type of &quot;epicormic&quot;
	growth on twigs of the smaller and more vigorous Hemlock, as well as
	the common presence of cones on these trees, despite their afflicted
	state. It also seems likely that the abundance of White Pine in the
	understory is a consequence of thinning of the canopy by the Hemlock
	Wooly Adelgid.<p>

	<p><b>Source
	Walk: 6-22-01</b><ul>
	<p>Our
	walk this day began at near 10:00 AM. It was immediately apparent
	that the deep source spring had a stronger flow than on 6-4-01.
	It was also noted that pollywogs were present in the stream edge.<p>
		A soil
	sample  (no 7)  was taken from a 2-3 inch depth as close as
	possible to a blooming plant of Columbine on a flat part of the
	flood plain just west of the stream and far from a gravel path.
	Alluvium here was sandstone cobble with sandy, organic matter-rich
	soil in the interstices. An initial pH value of 5.6 was obtained for
	this soil, and 28 hours later one of 5.7.<p>
		Another
	soil sample  (no 8)  was taken from close to a second Columbine not
	far from the first. The soil here was similar to that at the site of
	sample 7. This sample was found to have pH values of 6.8 and 7.0
	initially and 28 hours later respectively.<p>
		These pH
	values of soils in close proximity to Columbine thus appear to be
	markedly higher than those obtained in close proximity to other
	plant species and communities on this flood plain, both aiding in
	defining the stability field of this species and serving as an
	illustration of the overriding importance of microhabitats in
	floristics.<p>
		Additional
	floral observations included noting the common occurrence and
	association of Wood Nettle and Horse Balm and the first Crinkled
	Hairgrass  (<i>Deschampsia  flexuosa</i>),  then in bloom. Ovenbirds
	were heard, as were Red-eyed Vireos, drumming unidentified
	woodpeckers and American Toads   (<i>Bufo americanus</i>)  from the
	stream. Small unidentified birds were common in the canopy. Red -
	spotted Purple   (<i>Limenitis  arthemis  astyanax</i>)  
	Butterflies were abundant on the road and fritillaries, yellow
	swallowtails and Spring Azures   (<i>Lycanopsis  argiolus 
	pseudargiolus</i> )   were also noted. Small, light-colored
	lepidoptera, whose number is usually an indication of habitat
	richness, as well as other small insects, including mosquitoes, were
	all common, if not abundant.<p>

	<p>	The
	following walks were primarily to monitoring soil and water
	temperatures, and other observations are more or less incidental.
	With benefit of a year's hindsight, weather conditions during this
	period were perhaps not far from &quot;normal.&quot; especially in
	light of the 2002 heat wave. As previously noted, data obtained are
	already posted on our web site.<p>
		On
	7-28-01 the stream was dry, or rather submerged beneath its bed
	load, in places, while both the branch stream and small seep were
	entirely dry. Species noted for the first time were the tick
	trefoils <i>Desmodium  nudiflorum,</i> <i>D. glutinosum </i>and <i>D.
	 viridiflorum</i>, with the first two in bloom and last two
	restricted to the richest-appearing soil areas, and perhaps
	influenced by introduced limestone gravels. Also noted for the first
	time were Basil Balm  (<i>Monarda  clinopodia</i>),  in bloom as
	well, and, in association with Millet Grass an Enchanter's
	Nightshade with the characteristics of <i>Quadrisulcata  canadensis</i>.<p>
		On
	8-15-01 the stream was flowing strongly as were the seep and
	branch stream. A determination of the pH of the Deep Source Spring
	yielded 4.5. An additional plant recorded on this walk was Wingstem
	 (<i>Verbesina  alternifolia</i>)  in bloom. On 9-11-01 the seep
	was dry and on 10-11-01 the seep and branch stream were both
	dry. On 11-2-01 the seep was again dry and the stream low enough
	for surface water to be absent in many places.<p>

		As
	previously noted, the 2002 growing season was probably unusually
	warm and dry, and this was borne out by soil and water temperatures
	recorded by us at Ramsey's Draft  (see our &quot;<a href=soiltemperatures/soil_2002.htm>Soil Temperature
	and Forest Type, II</a>&quot;).  However, the early part of the season
	deviated from this trend and produced some of the lowest
	temperatures recorded thus far.  Here we again report on
	observations incidental to the temperature measurements.<p>
	4-11-02 was a cool, bright day on which our walk began
	about 10: 15 Am. Spice Bush, Bluets, Wood Anemone, Bloodroot,
	Hepatica and <i>Potentilla  canadensis</i> were all in bloom, but no
	Canada Mayflower was yet to be seen. There was strong stream flow
	and Red-eyed Vireos were heard. Little or no bud swelling was
	apparent on Tuliptree, White Ash, basswood, Shagbark Hickory, White
	Pine, Muscletree or Sugar Maple. However the alien Morrow's
	Honeysuckle (<i> Lonicera  morrowi </i>) was leafing out.<p>
		4-26-02 was again cool but overcast at the 10:15 start of the
	survey. Species noted included Canada Mayflower, Early Saxifrage,
	Long-spurred  and Smooth Yellow Violets, the first Dog Violet (
	<i>Viola  conspersa</i>),  Great Chickweed  (<i>Stellaria  pubera 
	</i>), Blue Cohosh  (<i>Caulophyllum  thalictroides</i>)  and
	Mountain Anemone  (<i>Anemone  lancifolia</i>) -all in bloom, as
	well as Rattlesnake Fern. The Blue Cohosh was represented by a
	single plant found at the base of the colluvial slope near soil
	temperature station 5.Red-eyed Vireos were heard.<p>
		The
	5-15-02 walk began cool, sunny and windy at near 9:25 AM. Noted
	for the first time was Plume Lily  (<i>Smilacina </i> <i>racemosa</i>) as well as Deer-tongue Grass,  Canada violet and Canada
	Mayflower, with all still in bloom. An impression was also gained of
	an abundance of small White Ash and birch saplings, perhaps, like
	those of the White Pine previously mentioned, attributable to the
	opening of the canopy by the Hemlock Wooly Adelgid. Birds, as usual,
	were common and included Red-eyed Vireo, Scarlet Tanager and
	Ovenbird.<p>
		5-23-02, 6-15-02 and 7-2-02 saw a gradual increase in air, soil
	and water temperatures. At the 9:45 AM start of the 5-23-02 walk
	it was cool and sunny, and the calls of Ovenbirds were heard.
	Similarly the start at 9:15 AM on 6-15-02 was under cool, sunny
	but windy conditions, and for the first time small fish were seen in
	the deep source spring. Also, pollywogs were present in the stream.
	The seep was almost dry however and contained no pollywogs. Scarlet
	Tanagers and Ovenbirds were heard quite frequently. By contrast the
	9:15 start on 7-2-02 was under warm and hazy conditions. Fish
	were again seen in the deep source spring and 3/4 inch  (2 cm) 
	pollywogs in the stream. The stream was low, however, and the seep
	and branch stream dry. A pH reading was done of the deep source
	spring water and this was found to be 5.2, in marked contrast with
	the value of 4.5 obtained on 8-15-01 under high water
	conditions. This result is the expected one given that bases would
	be more concentrated under the low water conditions of 7-2-02.<p>
		7-25-02 saw a 9:15 start under overcast, humid conditions and the seep
	dry. On 8-21-02 the start at 9:15 was under cool conditions and
	soil at all stations dry. The deep source spring was low, the seep
	and branch stream dry. A pH determination of the deep source spring
	yielded a value of 5.0, in harmony with the spring's low flow
	volume. Although it was relatively cool at the 9:00 start on 9-6 -
	02, soils at all stations this day were very dry, the deep source
	spring virtually dry, and its water at a very low temperature  (15.5
	deg C)  in comparison with preceding values and its 2001 trend. This
	low temperature value can be attributed to a shortage of relatively
	warm shallow waters acting to dilute more deep lying cooler waters.
	On  9-19-02, at a 10:00 AM start was again relatively cool, but
	with overcast skies and drizzle. Although the seep and branch stream
	were still dry, soils were generally moister than on previous
	visits. The stream pH was found to be 5.1. However, of greatest
	interest was a one degree C increase in the median soil temperature.
	One explanation of this increase is a pick-up of exothermic soil
	respiration feeding on pent up dead organic matter that failed to
	decay under preceding dry conditions. It is possible that the
	apparent increase in soil moisture was a consequence of the decrease
	in the length of the day, slowing evapotranspiration.

Walk: 9-25-02</b>
<ul>
	<p>	The
	major objective of our walk this day was an inventory of the Aster
	Family  (Asteraceae)  of lower Ramsey's Draft but also other species
	of opportunity. However, three soil temperatures and the stream
	temperature were also determined. Weather conditions were sunny and
	pleasant at the 9:45 AM start of our walk, but we ended  in light
	rain in the late afternoon. Of some interest was the observed
	decrease in soil temperatures after their anomalous rise on 9-19 -
	02. 
	<p>Plants
	successively noted in the vicinity of the Wilderness parking lot
	were Blue Wood Aster, White Wood Aster, Crooked-stem Aster, Curtis
	Goldenrod, White Snakeroot and the first Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago  rugosa</i>)  
	and Tall Coneflower  (<i>Rudbeckia 
	laciniata</i>). <p>
		Now
	arriving at soil temperature station no 4, the first in this series,
	in close proximity to a Shagbark Hickory, a determination  (T-580) of T = 17.0 deg C was obtained. Then moving on to station no 5 at
	the base of the colluvial slope, a determination  (T-581)  again 
	yielded T = 17.0 deg C in moist soil. Still moving generally up -
	stream, but in a shallow loop through the forest to the east of the
	trail, we encountered Mad-dog Skullcap  (<i>Scutellaria 
	lateriflora</i>)  and Veiny Peavine  (<i>Lathyrus  venosus</i>). 
	Then, along the trail again, we saw Tall Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago 
	altissina</i>  or <i>S.  canadensis  </i>var  <i>scabrum </i>),
	Cudweed  (<i>Gnaphalium  obtusifolium </i>), Common Beggar-ticks (
	 <i>Bidens  vulgata</i>),  Horseweed  (<i>Conyza</i>  <i>canadensis</i>
	 or  <i>Erigeron  canadensis </i>), Common Ragweed  (<i>Ambrosia 
	artemisiifolia</i>),  Great Ragweed  (<i>A.  trifida</i>),  Woodland
	Sunflower, Carrion Flower, Four-leaf Yam  (<i>Dioscorea 
	quaternata</i>)  and Cut-leaf Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago  arguta</i> 
	var  <i>arguta </i>). The presence of Saw Brier was also confirmed.<p>
		At
	station no 6, the stream, our determination  (T-582)  found a
	water temperature of T = 17.0 deg C as well. Seen here at the cliff
	base was Ebony Spleenwort  and <i>Carex  platyphylla</i> with the
	broadest and longest leaves any of us had ever seen on this sedge. 
	<p>	It
	should be mentioned that temperature station no 7, at a seep, is
	omitted here because the seep was dry.<p>
		Passing 
	through the open area at the cliff base and over large cobbles, we
	encountered the tick- trefoil <i>Desmodium</i>  <i>paniculatum</i>
	in the dry stream bed, while nearby grew Silverrod  (<i>Solidago 
	bicolor</i>), Grass-leaved Goldenrod  (<i>Euthamia  graminifolia
	</i>), beautifully blooming Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod  (photo), 
	Woodland Sunflower, Heath Aster  (<i>Aster  pilosus</i>)   and, at
	the water's edge, <i>Carex  scabrata.</i><p>
	<i>	</i>Pausing
	at soil temperature station no 8, we recorded  (T-583)  yet
	another value of T= 17.0 deg C for the soil, then continued to make
	our way along the trail. A spot inventory was subsequently done in
	the vicinity of the derelict Game Commission buildings. Bearing in
	mind that the flora here likely reflects the presence of limestone
	gravel, we tallied Purple-top Grass  (<i>Triodia  flava</i>), 
	Wingstem, Wild Bergamot  (<i>Monarda  fistulosa </i>), the tick
	-trefoil <i>Desmodium  viridiflorum, </i>Cutleaf Grapefern (
	<i>Botrychium</i>  <i>dissectum </i>), the aliens Coltsfoot (
	<i>Tussilago  farfara</i>),  Spotted Knapweed  (<i>Centaurea 
	maculosa</i>)  and Smooth Crabgrass  (<i>Digitaria  ischaemum</i>) 
	as well as  Tree Moss.<p>
		In the
	afternoon another traverse was made up-valley and the stream was
	crossed to the valley's east side, about half way between the Game
	Commission buildings and the Wilderness boundary to the north. Still
	moving up-valley we noted a little of the alien grass <i>Microstegium
	 vimineum</i>. and the edible fungus &quot;Chicken-of-the -
	woods&quot;  (<i>Laetiporus  sulphureus</i>),  which we later
	consumed for supper.<p>
		We now
	proceeded up-stream on a low terrace composed of boulder cobbles
	and with a springbrook at its eastern edge. <i>Carex  scabrata</i>
	was exceptionally abundant along this brook.<p>
		We soon
	came to several beaver dams, one above the other, on the brook. The
	largest and farthest up-stream of the ponds behind the dams
	contained a lodge as well  (photo).  Freshly pealed sticks indicated
	that the lodge was still occupied.<p>
		Fish,
	some perhaps 10 inches  (25 cm)  in length, were present in these
	ponds. Tentatively identified by R. Hunsucker were Black-nose Dace
	  (<i>Rhinichthys   atratulus</i>)  and Northern Hog Sucker (
	<i>Hypertelium  nigricans</i>).  A frog of unidentified species
	leapt into the water from the lodge. One of the few bird signs was
	the call of a Red-shouldered Hawk. Also present in the ponds were
	Larger water Starwort  (<i>Callitriche  heterophylla</i>)  and an
	unidentified species of the alga <i>Nitella</i>, while American
	Water Pennywort  (<i>Hydrocotyle  americana</i>)  occurred on the
	bank. Of particular interest was the occurrence, in association with
	Mountain Laurel, of a single seedling of Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron  maximum</i>),  in the first appearance of this
	species here, and only the second in the Shenandoah Mountain area (see our section on <a href=nrivervalley.htm>The North River Valley</a>) !<p>
		Here we
	found ourselves in a generally mature, if not old growth forest,
	dominated by severely defoliated Hemlock and White Pine, with a
	number of smaller deciduous species, in particular Black Birch. The
	sparse shrub layer was dominated by Mountain Laurel and the ground
	flora by Intermediate Shield Fern. A number of quite large trees,
	particularly Black Birch, had been felled by Beavers, resulting in
	many crossed down boles 
	<p>	After
	terminating our traverse in this exceedingly difficult terrain, we
	re-crossed the stream and returned to the trail on the valley's west
	side. On our return along the trail we identified Robin's Plantain (
	<i>Erigeron  pulchellus</i>),  the grass <i>Cinna </i> <i>arundiacea</i>,
	Tall White Lettuce  (<i>Prenanthes  altissima</i>)  and Common Joe -
	pye Weed  (<i>Eupatorium  fistulosum</i>). <p>
		Tests
	were also done to determine the acidity of the &quot;soil&quot;
	immediately beneath well rotted down wood. The first specimen (
	sample no 9)  was taken from beneath a decayed stump, possibly
	Hemlock. pH values obtained were 4.8 and 5.7 initially and after 21
	hours respectively. The second specimen   (sample no 10)  was taken
	from beneath a well rotted down bole, and an initial pH value of 5.7
	was obtained. However, after 21 hours this had increased to 7.2.<p>

	<p>	On
	this day two inventories were conducted, the first down-Valley
	from Mountain House in the vicinity of the Deep-source Spring of
	our soil and water temperature program, the other up-Valley from
	the Wilderness parking lot, along the NW Valley side to the vicinity
	of the derelict Game Commission buildings. A major objective was a
	survey of sedges<p>
		On our
	way down-Valley we noted an Indigo Bunting  (<i>Passerina  cyanea</i>).  Sensitive Fern, One-flowered Broomrape, <i>Carex  digitalis,
	C.  platyphylla, C.  communis,</i> and, at the Spring, abundant
	Spice Bush, Canada Mayflower, Star Flower and <i>Medeola</i>, as
	well as Bluets,  Wood Anemone  (including the form sometimes
	referred to as &quot;<i>A.  lancifolia</i>&quot;)  and <i>Carex</i>.
	 <i>appalachica, </i>with swollen  (and presumably diseased) 
	perigynia. Also seen in the Spring vicinity were the wood rush
	<i>Luzula  acuminata, Carex  laxiflora, C.  prasina,</i> New York
	Fern  (<i>Thelypteris  noveboracensis</i>),  the forest grass
	<i>Brachyelytrum  erectum</i>, Mad-dog Skullcap, Nodding Fescue
	and Deer-tongue Grass; while at its wet edge were <i>Carex 
	scabrata</i> Fowl Manna Grass  (<i>Glyceria  striata</i>),  the
	manna grass <i>G.  melicaria</i> and Pennsylvania Bittercress (<i>
	Cardamine </i> <i>pensylvanica </i>). On the bank of the &quot;Adjacent
	Spring&quot; we saw a little stunted Columbine and Lance-leaved
	Aster  (<i>Aster lancifolia</i>).   
	<p>	A
	moss flora collected from the edge of the Deep-source Spring
	consisted of <i>Mnium  hornum</i>, <i>Dicranella  heteromalla,
	Tetraphis  pellucida, Hypnum  pallescens, Amblystegium  fluviatile</i>
	 (on stones submerged in shallow water),  <i>Sematophyllum 
	marylandicum </i>and<i> Dicranum  fuscescens,</i> then from the
	&quot;adjacent Spring&quot;, submerged <i>Fontinalis  novae -
	angliae</i> and <i>Amblystegium  fluviatile. </i>
	<p><i>	</i>Now,
	moving to our up-Valley site, we proceeded northeast along the
	Valley side, as on a number of previous occasions, noting <i>Carex 
	radiata, C.  appalachica</i>, Maryland Figwort  (<i>Scrofularia 
	marilandica</i>)  and on rotting sticks, the small red cup fungus
	<i>Scarcoscypha   occidentalis.</i> These were followed by Carex 
	<i>cephalophora</i>, Poke Milkweed, the blue-eyed Grass
	<i>Sisyrinchium  angustifolium</i> and the first Smooth Sweet Cicely
	 (<i>Osmorhiza  longistylis</i>)  seen by us in the Draft. We had
	now reached the open rock terrace that forms the stream's right bank
	and which is in turn bordered by the red siltstone and sandstone
	cliffs referred to in our other inventories. Here, for the first
	time, we tallied Purple-leaved Willow-herb  (<i>Epilobium </i>
	<i>coloratum</i>),  the alien Mouse-ear Chickweed  (<i>Cerastium 
	vulgatum</i>)  and Indian  Tobacco  (<i>Lobelia  inflata</i>) ; then
	<i>Carex  communis,</i>  <i>Carex  torta</i> in the stream bed,
	Smooth Rockcress. and a large land snail. Associated more with the
	cliff were Long-flowered Alumroot  (<i>Heuchera  longiflora</i>), 
	Southern Bellflower,  <i>Phlox </i> g<i>laberrima</i>,  Wood
	anemone, <i>Carex  swanii,</i> Golden Alexanders  (<i>Zizia  aptera</i>), Wild Sarsaparilla  (<i>Aralia</i>  <i>nudicaulis </i>), Woodland
	sunflower and Allegheny Blackberry with some characteristics of
	Pennsylvania Blackberry. Before terminating our traverse, and within
	the forest, we noted <i>Carex  sparganoides</i>, a somewhat northern
	species and, according to Strausbaugh and Core  (1977), 
	characteristic of &quot;rich woods.&quot;<p>
		Additionally,
	determinations were made of the pH of the well-rotted wood beneath
	the bryophyte cover of three down boles. The first of these boles
	was of the order of 25 cm in diameter and was sparsely covered by
	unidentified bryophytes. This sample  (no 11)  had a  pH of 5.0
	initially, but after three days, one of 4.8, an insignificant
	change. The second sample  (no 12)  was taken from beneath what
	appeared to be<i> </i>the<i> </i>moss<i> Thuidium  delicatulum</i>
	that formed a patchy cover on a bole of a diameter similar to the
	first. A pH value of 4.8 was obtained both initially and after three
	days. The third sample  (no 13)  came from beneath a luxuriant cover
	of bryophytes from a somewhat larger down bole that included a very
	long stemmed and robust but unidentified species of the moss <i>Mnium</i>.
	The wood of this sample also appeared to exhibit a greater degree of
	decay than the other samples. An initial pH value of 5.3 was
	obtained, but after three days this had increased to 5.8. If these
	values are compared to the pH values obtained earlier for &quot;soil&quot;
	from beneath well rotted down wood  (sample nos 9 and 10),  there is
	a suggestion that, at least in this case, alkalinity increases as
	decay progresses.<p>

<p><h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
	<p>For
	a number of species the lower Ramsey's Draft watershed mirrors the
	climatic zone of the highest elevations. The Yellow Birch already
	referred to is joined by a number of other cold-climate species,
	including Wild Sarsaparilla, Canada Mayflower, Star Flower, Millet
	Grass, Red Elderberry, Choke Cherry, Mountain Holly, Mountain Ash
	and  White Wood Sorrel. Also, even our brief inventories already
	disclosed species such as Columbine, Millet Grass, Long-spurred and
	Canada Violets and others with more demanding soil requirements than
	any found in the upper watershed. This result is to be expected
	since the  alluvial deposits in the lower watershed draw upon a far
	greater variety of rock types, and most particularly the weaker,
	frequently concealed and more nutrient-rich shales, mudstones and
	possible minor carbonate beds. These differences are also reflected
	in the soil pH values, which are much higher in the lower Draft than
	in the RNA. In this regard the species and communities in both the
	upper and lower watershed should be viewed in terms of their
	inferred stability relations  (Mueller, 2000). Also, the transported
	material has been subject to greater modification by soil-building
	organisms than the raw rock fragments that dominate the cold, dry
	soils of higher elevations. Additionally, the greater species
	richness of the lower watershed-which so far includes more than
	200 species- presents more opportunities to study microhabitats
	and the effect of terrain nuances such as we observed in the case of
	Yellow Birch. 
	<p>It
	is interesting to view the area in terms of Rawinski's  (1992) 
	system of classification based on nutrient regimes represented by
	the floras. In this system, which is of considerable utility as an
	overview of a variety of forest types, the following sequence of
	decreasing nutrient availability descriptors is used:<p>
 
 <ol>
	<li>eutrophic 
	<li>permesotrophic 
	<li>mesotrophic 
	<li>submesotrophic 
	<li>oligotrophic
 </ol>
<p>
	<p>Species
	which fall under these descriptors were determined by consultations
	with a variety of knowledgeable observers. It should be mentioned
	that this system has as its basis the same assumptions that underlie
	the stability field approach espoused here, but in rule-of-thumb
	form.<p>
	Species
	lower in the sequence may also be present in a given flora higher in
	the sequence, but not the reverse. Although, in its classic
	manifestation, forest types that fall under this system occur as
	distinct stands, plant species indicators of all five descriptors
	occur in the lower Ramsey's Draft, usually as part of a complex
	mosaic of microhabitats. Thus the observed Millet Grass is regarded
	as eutrophic, although, it is also recognized as part of a boreal
	flora. Additionally, according to Rawinski, the sedge <i>Carex 
	scabrata</i>, which is common along springbrooks and at places on
	the banks of Ramsey's Draft, is regarded part of the eutrophic water
	saturated class, although, in the opinion of this reporter, this
	position is probably too high in the sequence. The observed Canada
	Violet and Blue Cohosh are regarded as defining  permesotrophic
	floras if Millet Grass is absent from the microhabitats in which
	they occur, and Black Cohosh a mesotrophic flora in the absence of
	the previously mentioned species or others higher in the sequence.
	Although it is permissible for many diagnostic species of lower
	members of the sequence to occur in higher member floras, such
	occurrences are constrained by the stability relations of the
	species represented. Thus Mountain Laurel, an oligotropic species,
	would not be expected to be stable in a eutrophic community, 
	because, for one, its required pH is probably too low. However it
	might occur stably in a mesotrophic or submesotrophic community.<p>
	The
	relations between the various species of bryophytes and habitat is
	less clear. As an example, the mosses<i> Hypnum  cupressiforme  </i>and
	<i>Rhytidiadelphus  triquetrus</i>, calciphiles on soils in at least
	parts of their ranges  (Crum and Anderson, 1981; Conard, 1974),  -
	whether through failure to detect or not-were not observed by us
	in the calcareous terrain of Blowing Springs, but occur here on 
	dead and possibly living trees.<p>
