<h2>Source Walks:  9-6-95 and 10-8-95</h2>
<ul>
<p>	Northeast of Hardscrabble Knob
the rampart of the Shenandoah Range extends unbroken for 30 miles (48 km).   The northwest slope of this mountain is almost a scarp
with descent to South Branch of the Potomac River in only three
horizontal miles  (5 km).   In contrast, the southeast slope falls
away more gradually in a complex series of spurs and deeply incised
streams eight or more miles  (13 km)  to the Shenandoah Valley. 
Punctuating the main ridge are a number of higher elevation areas
similar to Hardscrabble Knob.  These knobs stand guard at the head of
Valleys that shelter some of the most remote habitat in the Eastern
U.S.  Viewed from these knobs in early spring the distant valley
floors and lower slopes show the first delicate yellow and red flush
of newly emerging leaves while the surrounding forest still has weeks
to remain bare-limbed.  Coupled with variations of soils, aspect and
air drainage, this elevation difference of about 3000 ft. (910
meters) has resulted in considerable disjunct habitat and endemism,
the full extent of which are still being revealed.  In addition,the
Range possesses most of the regions old growth forest, although most
of this is of the high elevation &quot;orchard type&quot; with squat,
contorted trees that were unsuitable for commercial exploitation.</p>
<p class="western">	The panorama of unbroken forest from these
heights is a reminder of what the primitive Appalachians were like. 
Given that most of the Range is part of the George Washington
National Forest and that it has a relatively low road density of less
than a half mile (0.8 km)  per 1000 acres (400 hectares), it has an
almost unparalleled potential for the creation of large &mdash;in
excess of 100,000 acres (40,000 hectares)&mdash; wilderness preserves
in the East. It was from the summit of Reddish Knob, in fact, that
President Clinton announced his much praised roadless area protection
directive.   Indeed the largest of these tracts, lying to the SW of
Reddish Knob, has been proposed as a 65,000 acre (26,300 hectare)
&ldquo;Shenandoah Wilderness&rdquo; (Mueller, 1991). Recently this
proposed wilderness has been renamed the &quot;Ernie Dickerman
Wilderness&quot; in honor of the most prominent eastern wilderness
activist who is now deceased  (Mueller 1999). This wilderness would
encompass all of the already designated Ramsey's Draft Wilderness (see <a href=ramsey.htm>our section on Ramsey's Draft</a>)  and the entire upper North River
and Little River watersheds.  Contiguous with this tract, lying to
the NE, beyond State Route 924, is another potential wilderness with
Bother Knob as its sentinel.  Unlike Reddish Knob, the summit of
Bother Knob is unmarred by a road, although Forest Road 85 runs along
its base.  In its relative solitude, Bother Knob looks down on a deep
valley with the unpromising name of &ldquo;Skidmore Fork&rdquo;, but
which, in its upper reaches, contains one of the last stands in the
region of old growth Hemlock-Northern Hardwoods.</p>
<p>	Shenandoah
Mountain is home to the endemic Cowknob Salamander (<i>Plethodon punctatus</i>).   It also harbors a number of more widespread
salamanders and it is possible in a short stroll along a mountain
stream to uncover five or more species.  Also endemic is at least one
millipede, the Shenandoah Mountain  Xystodermid  (<i>Nannaria 
Shenandoah</i>)  and a globally-rare variety of Least Trillium
(<i>Trillium  pusillum</i> var. <i>monticulum</i>).  This Mountain is
known for its breeding populations of disjunct northern birds such as
the Red Crossbill  (<i>Loxia</i>  <i>curvirostra</i>),  which has a
circumpolar range, as well as others that breed at high elevations on
the Allegheny Mountains and on Whitetop and  Mt. Rogers   Other
disjuncts include isolated stands of Paper Birch (<i>Betula 
papyrifera </i>) and Drooping Bluegrass (<i>Poa  languida </i>) (
Smith, 1991).  According to biologists the probability is very high
that a number of other rare species are present as well.</p>
<p>	If, for the
moment, one puts out of mind the environmental mayhem caused by the
automobile, the winding drive up Virginia State Route 924 to the
Shenandoah crest is always exhilarating.  The more so in early
September when summer heat still blankets the Valley.  Stately
Tuliptree  (<i>Liriodendron  tulipifera</i>)  groves of the lower
Briery Branch give way to dry Chestnut Oak   (<i> Quercus  prinus</i>
)-pine forests of the middle slopes and these in turn yield gradually
to a cooler and moister regime of Northern Red Oak  <i> (Quercus 
rubra</i>),  birches and  Canada Hemlock  (<i>Tsuga  canadensis</i>) 
of a climatic zone diverted here from the north.</p>
<p>	Our first stop is
at the junction of Rt. 924 with Forest Road 85 in Briery Branch Gap. 
A spot inventory at the junction shows the forest to be a patchy
survivor of human abuse, now mending, but with few really large
trees.  However it is, here at an elevation of about 3700 ft. (1130
meters), quite different from the Chestnut Oak forest below.  In
rough order of abundance the canopy species are Black Birch (<i>
Betula  lenta</i>),  Canada Hemlock  (apparently Adelgid infested), 
Black Cherry  (<i>Prunus  serotina</i>),  Black Locust  (<i>Robinia 
pseudoacacia</i>),  Red Maple  (<i>Acer </i> <i>rubrum </i>),
Northern Red and White (<i> Quercus  alba</i>)  Oaks with
Serviceberry  (<i>Amelanchier</i> sp)  and Striped Maple (<i> Acer 
pensylvanicum</i>)  in the understory.  The shrub layer consists of
Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana</i>,),  Mountain. Laurel  (<i>Kalmia 
latifolia</i>),  Mountain Fetterbush  (<i>Pieris  floribunda</i>), 
Witch Hazel  ( <i>Hamamelis  virginiana </i>)  and, along the road,
Staghorn Sumac  ( <i>Rhus  typhina</i>).  The patchwork of deciduous
trees, Hemlock and the road opening create a number of habitats for
different herbs.  Hay-scented Fern  (<i>Dennstaedtia  punctilobula</i>
) dominates, but Christmas Fern  (<i>Polystichum  acrostichoides</i>
), White Snakeroot  (<i>Eupatorium  rugosum</i>),  Hog Peanut (
<i>Amphicarpa  bracteata</i>),  and Mountain Aster  (<i>Aster 
acuminatus</i>)  are also common.  In more shaded spots, especially
around Hemlocks, Partridge Berry  (<i>Mitchella  repens</i>), 
Intermediate  Shield Fern  (<i>Dryopteris  intermedia</i>)  and a
little Ground Pine  (<i>Lycopodium  flabelliforme)   </i>may be
found.</p>
<p>	Reddish Knob lies
a little over a mile to the southwest, with FR85 passing along its
base.  About a mile along this road a short road forks off and runs
to the summit.  Because of the time factor an inventory between Route
924 and this fork was sketchy.  However it is apparent that the
forest along this stretch of FR 85, which lies at about 4000 ft.
(1220 meters) asl, is dominantly Northern Red Oak  but also with a
number of mesic species such as Yellow (<i> Betula  alleganiensis</i>
) and Black Birchs, Shagbark Hickory  (<i> Carya  ovata</i>)  and
Butternut  (<i>Juglans  cinerea</i>)  and with Flowering Raspberry
(<i>Rubus  odoratus</i>) still in full bloom on the roadside in
September.</p>
<p>	At the fork, at
an elevation of perhaps 4200 ft. (1280 meters), the forest is more
mesic than at Route 924 and consequently more diverse, although it
contains more northern and high elevation species.  It is dominated
by Northern Red Oak but there is no White Oak,  since the latter is
usually restricted to elevations below 4000 ft.  Red Maple, Black
Cherry, Yellow Birch, Serviceberry and American Chestnut   (<i>Castanea
</i> <i>dentata</i>) sprouts occur, and Striped Maple is very
abundant and is joined by Fire Cherry (<i> Prunus  pensylvanica </i>).
In the understory.  Shrubs include Witch Hazel, Mountain Holly and
some Mountain Laurel and Mountain Fetterbush.  Increased elevation is
reflected in the presence of Mountain Ash  (<i>Pyrus  americana</i>) 
seedlings and in the greater abundance of Mountain Aster.  White
Snakeroot and Hay-scented Fern are abundant along the road.  Other
herbs are Marginal Shield Fern  (<i>Dryopteris  marginalis</i>), 
Crinkled Hair Grass  (<i>Deschampsia  flexuosa</i>),  Plume Lily (
<i>Smilacina  racemosa</i>),  a Clintonia, probably Yellow (
<i>Clintonia borealis</i>), Wild Sarsaparilla  (<i>Aralia  nudicaulis</i>
) and Fly Poison (<i>Amianthium  musc&aelig;toxicum</i>).  On the NW
talus slope there is Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium  virginianum</i>) and
Wild Liveforever (<i>Sedum  telephioides</i>).</p>
<p>	From the fork it
is a short hike to the summit along the road which ascends along a
steep northeast-facing slope.  Along this slope the trees of the
dominantly Northern Red Oak forest become increasingly orchard-like
and soils are moist enough for a diversity of mesic species.  There
is Yellow Birch,  Sugar Maple (<i> Acer  saccharum</i>),  hawthorn (
<i>Crataegus </i> sp),  Thornless Blackberry  (<i>Rubus  canadensis
</i>), Alternate-leaf Dogwood (<i>Cornus  alternifolia</i>), Beaked
Hazelnut  (<i>Corylus  cornuta</i>),  Minnie-bush  (<i>Menziesia 
pilosa</i>),  Bear Oak  (<i>Quercus  ilicifolia </i>), Choke Cherry (
<i>Prunus  virginiana </i>) and clumps of vigorous Mountain Maple (
<i>Acer  spicatum</i>).   Poison Ivy  (<i>Rhus  radicans</i>) occurs
here beyond its usual elevation limit.  Pale Touch-Me Not (<i>Impatiens
 pallida</i>) and Thin-leaved Sunflower  (<i>Helianthus  decapetalus</i>
) are among roadside herbs.</p>
<p>	As the road
rounds the Mountain to the south side Red Oak becomes much more
stunted and mesic species, except Yellow Birch, drop out.  On the
open roadside slope the first Blueberry  (<i>Vaccinium </i> sp
)occurs with Wild Liveforever,  Climbing False Buckwheat (<i>Polygonum scandens</i>), Silverrod (<i>Solidago  bicolor</i>), Southern
Bellflower (<i> Campanula  divaricata</i>)  and Stiff Aster (<i>
Aster  linariifolius</i>). </p>
<p>	The top of
Reddish Knob, at 4397 ft. (1340 meters) is open due to human
intervention in the form of a parking lot, but the upper slopes are
covered by a dwarf forest of Northern Red Oak little more than 20 ft.
(6 meters) high.  Yellow Birch is a minor component.  In one place
this beautiful and interesting forest had been clearcut quite
contrary to its regulations, by the US Forest Service for the benefit
of hang gliding, an activity now banned. Small trees and shrubs,
among them Fire Cherry, Minnie-bush,  Hazelnut, Mountain Laurel,
Mountain Fetterbush, Red Raspberry  (<i>Rubus  idaeus</i>)  Allegheny
 Blackberry  (<i>Rubus  allegheniensis</i>)  and Black Chokeberry (
<i>Aronia  melanocarpa</i>)  have come up in this opening.  Also
present on the summit are Witch Hazel and American Chestnut sprouts.</p>
<p>	Northern Red Oak on the summit
is vigorous and at this season bore clusters of large acorns.  One
characteristic of these oaks is their thick, leathery leaves which
differ greatly from the thin leaves of low elevation Northern Red
Oaks.  This characteristic may signal the presence of a variant of
this tree adapted to the strong drying winds on this summit.</p>
<p>	As one passes
around to the north side of the upper slope, just below the summit,
an assemblage of northern and mountain species is encountered. 
Included are Mountain Maple<i>, </i>Mountain Ash, Wild Sarsaparilla,
Intermediate Shield Fern, Mountain Bindweed   ( <i>Polygonum cilinode</i>),  Red Raspberry  and an unidentified alumroot  (<i>Heuchera  </i>sp<i>
 </i>).  Also present are such widespread species as Black Cherry,
Common Greenbriar  (<i> Smilax  rotundifolia</i>),  Christmas Fern
and Indian Turnip (<i>Aris&aelig;ma  triphyllum</i>). An aster common
on the summit was Blue Wood Aster (<i>Aster  cordifolius </i>).Virtually
the only evidence of bird life noted on this upland was the calls of
Ravens  (<i>Corvus  corax</i>)  which seem always to be present.</p>
<p>	A spot inventory
was done along FR 85 at about 0.8 mile (1.3 km) NE of the junction
with Rt. 924.  This location, a way station to Bother Knob, lies at
about 3800 ft. (1160 meters) asl.  As at other locations along this
ridge, the area is recovering from past abuses which left openings in
the forest as well as plantations of alien species such as Norway
Spruce (<i>Picea  abies</i>) and Red Pine (<i>Pinus  resinosa</i>)
and native Red Spruce (<i> Picea  rubens</i>)  and White Pine  (<i>Pinus
 strobus</i>).   However the most abundant canopy species here is
Hemlock (apparently Adelgid-free) with Northern Red Oak, Black Birch,
Red Maple, Black Cherry, Black Locust and Pitch Pine  (<i>Pinus 
rigida</i>).   There are also scattered beautiful large White Oaks
with spreading crowns, possibly indicative of growth to maturity in
openings.  Striped Maple is abundant in the understory while the
shrub layer is dominated by Mountain Fetterbush up to ten feet (3
meters) tall, large vigorous Mountain Holly<i> </i> and lesser
amounts of Mountain Laurel.  Also noted were American Chestnut
sprouts and a single Chestnut Oak, here considerably above its normal
elevation range.</p>
<p>	Hay-scented Fern
is the dominant herb, as is the case for many mountain summits, and
the  Blue Wood Aster is more abundant than on Reddish Knob.  Other
herbs of note are White Snakeroot, Heath Aster (<i>Aster pilosus</i>),
Whorled Loosestrife  (<i>Lysimachia  quadrifoila</i>)  and grasses. 
Most of these herbs are concentrated in openings and are excluded in
the dense shade of evergreen trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>	Another spot
inventory was done at about one mile (1.6 km.) from the junction at a
3869 ft. (1179 meter) benchmark.  While the forest here is similar to
that at the previous spot inventory, the following additional species
were noted:  Yellow Birch, Hophornbeam  (<i>Ostrya  virginiana</i>), 
Intermediate Shield Fern, Indian Turnip, Creeping Five-leaf  (
<i>Potentilla  simplex/canadensis</i>,)  White Grass   ( <i>Leersia 
virginica</i>)  and  Wild Liveforever.  The mint Field Basil   (
<i>Satureja  vulgaris ) </i>  is abundant along the road.</p>
<p>	About 1.8 miles
(2.9 km.) to the NE from the last stop the road intersects a
southwest-tending ridge at about 4200 ft. (1280 meters) elevation.  A
faint trail along the crest of this ridge leads to Bother Knob, about
a mile distant.  At the point of intersection, Panicled Hawkweed (
<i>Hieracium   paniculatum </i>) and a few small plants of Red
Raspberry were noted.  The forest along this ridge is primarily
Northern Red Oak, but with substantial Yellow Birch on the northwest
side.  Also common are Hemlock (apparently Adelgid-free), Black
Locust, Black Cherry, Red Maple, Table Mountain Pine  (<i> Pinus 
pungens </i>), Striped Maple and Mountain Fetterbush.  Hay-scented
Fern, mostly brown (perhaps due to frost) was the dominant ground
cover, but Crinkled Hairgrass and  Mountain Bindweed  were also
common.  Ravens called and two cavorted high above the slope while
flocks of Juncos  (<i>Junco  hyemalis</i>)  foraged in the
undergrowth.  If the usual pattern is followed these Juncos will
appear in the Shenandoah Valley late in October.</p>
<p>	Farther along the
trail Common Greenbrier is conspicuous in its lush growth, climbing
up Hemlocks and Mountain Fetterbush.  Nearby are thorned Blackberries
and near the trail Wild Strawberries (<i>Fragaria  virginiana</i>). 
One of the commonest plants underfoot on the trail is alien, Field
Sorrel (<i>  Rumex  acetosella</i> ).   Here also are anthills, not
particularly large, and inhabited by medium-sized ants with black
abdomens and red thoraxes &mdash; apparently identical to
those noted by us on the Blue Ridge&rsquo;s Big Levels Plateau.</p>
<p>	The rock outcrops on prominent
elevations of the ridge are thin-bedded and cross-bedded sandstones
probably of the Pocono Formation  (Rader and Evans, 1993).  
Characteristically Common Polypody or Rock Fern  is associated with
this rock, as is Wild Liveforever.  A little Beaked Hazelnut  and
wild gooseberry (<i>Ribes</i> sp.) grow nearby.</p>
<p>	At this point the ridge turns rather
sharply northwest toward the Bother Summit.  Here we come upon
several Virginia Pines (<i> Pinus</i>  <i>virginiana</i>) with cones.
 These apparently healthy trees, perhaps 15 ft.  (4.6 meters) in
length, lie almost prostrate, seemingly under severe stress although
surrounding hardwoods remain upright.  It is possible that they are
in this way responding to an elevation of perhaps 4300 ft. (1310
meters) asl, since it is unusual to see this species much above 3000
ft. (910 meters).  Also, a little way down the southeast slope there
is at least one small grove of Beech  (<i>Fagus  grandifolia</i>), 
the only example of this species seen on the mountain thus far.</p>
<p>	The summit of Bother Knob is an
artificially maintained &ldquo;bald&rdquo; or meadow which
unfortunately is dominated by alien vegetation.  Conspicuous are
Timothy (<i> Phleum  pratense</i>),  Field Sorrel and Yarrow
(<i>Achillea  millefolium</i>) although the latter may also be
native.  Known natives such as Creeping Five-leaf  and White
Snakeroot are also present.  Some of the Northern Red Oaks, which
dominate the meadow&rsquo;s edge, are very contorted, hollow and show
signs of repeated fires.  Some Black Cherries are also severely
deformed by the wind and in addition are severely infected by Black
Knot Fungus (<i>Dibotryon  morbosum</i>).</p>
<p>	Yellow Birch is quite abundant on the
north side of the knob but drops out and is replaced by Black Birch
on the west and south sides which also have Pitch Pines.  A small
amount of alum root (<i>Heuchera</i>  sp.) was noted at the base of
an oak here.</p>
<p>	On the NE side of the knob, just below the summit,
there is a jumble of large sandstone blocks.  Growing from among
these are vigorous canes of Red Raspberry seeking out the sun thus
provided by the lack of trees, very much as this species was found to
occur on Hardscrabble and Reddish Knobs.</p>
<p>	According to Virginia&rsquo;s Division
of Natural Heritage  (Smith, 1991),  Millet Grass (<i>Milium 
effusum</i>), Ground Juniper (<i>Juniperus communus </i>) and the
Smooth Green Snake (<i>Opheodrys  vernalis</i>) are rare species that
occur on Bother Knob. However, none of these was seen by us. 
</ul>
<h2>Southwest of Reddish Knob</h2>

<b>Source Walks: 6-13-00 and 6-14-00</b><p>
<ul>
 Described here are three
inventory traverses, two on southeast slopes of a local prominence a
little less than a mile  (1.6 km)  southwest of Reddish Knob, and one
on a  gently sloping projection that overlooks the Valley of the
South Branch of the Potomac River.</p>
<p>	Our first inventory, which began in the early
afternoon of 6-13-00, was preceded  by a very hard
thundershower that blew down our kitchen tarp. The inventory extended
a little down-slope from a road to an electronic installation through
perhaps a half acre  (0. 2 ha)  in a loop traverse. Elevations at
this location are near 4200 feet  (1281 m)  asl. The only exposed
rock seen by us was sandstone. However,  soils appeared to be high in
organic matter that was well incorporated into the mineral matter. It
is possible that the dominant bedrock here is actually a mudstone, as
a rock of this type is exposed up-slope. A soil sample  (no 1)  taken
from among Crinkled Hairgrass and sedges had an initial pH of 5.0 and
the same value 23 hours later.</p>
<p>	The canopy here, as in the area quite
generally, was dominated by squat, contorted broad-crowned Northern
Red Oak, perhaps averaging in the range of 20 inches  (0.5 m)  dbh.
Other canopy species were minor and consisted of Black Birch, Red
Maple, Black Locust, small and crooked Black Cherry, scattered Canada
Hemlock, seemingly little or not infested by the Adelgid, and
American Chestnut sprouts. It should be mentioned however, that signs
of the Adelgid had earlier been seen by us at the junction of State
Route 924 and Forest Road 85 at about 3700 feet (1130 m) asl. Small
and understory trees included especially Striped Maple, the hawthorn<i>
Crataegus  flabellata</i> and seedlings of Mountain Ash. Shrubs were
dominated by vigorous Witch Hazel accompanied by Mountain Fetterbush,
Mountain Laurel in bloom and Upland Low Blueberry, No vines were
seen.</p>
<p>	Ground cover was dominated by flowering
Crinkled Hairgrass and various sedges, including <i>Carex 
pensylvanica </i>and <i>C</i>.  <i>gracilescens</i>, which is said to
characterize &quot;rich woods and thickets&quot;  (Strausbaugh and
Core, 1977).  Other species were Creeping Five-leaf, in this case<i>
Potentilla  canadensis</i>, Mealy Bellwort  (<i>Uvularia  perfoliata</i>), Curtis Goldenrod (<i> Solidago  curtisii</i>),  Downy Wood Violet
 (<i>Viola  sororea</i>),  Plume Lily with very narrow leaves,
budding Black Cohosh (<i> Cimicifuga  racemosa</i>)  Woodland Meadow
Parsnip  (<i>Thaspium  trifoliatum </i>), Bluets  (<i>Houstonia 
caerulea </i>), abundant small <i>Prenanthes</i>, Cutleaf Goldenrod (
<i>Solidago  arguta </i> var  <i>boottii</i>),  possible Arrowleaf
Violet  (<i>Viola</i>  <i>sagittata</i>),  the woodrushes <i>Luzula 
multiflora</i> and <i>L.  echinata,</i> Downy Many Knees (<i>
Polygonatum  pubescens</i>),  an unidentified Heuchera (<i> Heuchera </i>
sp),  Lovage (<i> Ligusticum  canadense </i>), Filmy Angelica (
<i>Angelica  triquinata </i>), Indian Turnip, Panicled Hawkweed,
Mountain Oat Grass  (<i>Danthonia  compressa</i>),  more Bluets in
bloom, a little Wild Geranium  (<i>Geranium  maculatum</i>),  a trace
of stunted Horse Balm (<i> Collinsonia  canadensis </i>), White Wood
Aster  (<i>Aster  divaricatus</i>),  likely Basil Balm (<i> Monarda 
clinopodia</i>),  vigorous flowering Poke Milkweed (<i> Asclepias 
exaltata</i>),  Purple Bedstraw  (<i>Galium  latifolium</i>),  also
in bloom, Bigleaf Aster  (<i>Aster  macrophyllus </i>), Lady Fern (
<i>Athyrium  filix-femina</i>),  a single culm of the alien Orchard
Grass (<i> Dactylus  glomerata</i>),  Nodding Fescue  (<i>Festuca 
obtusa)</i>, Four-leaved Yam  (<i>Dioscorea  quaternata</i>),  and
Field Sorrel. Mosses noted were <i>Mnium</i>  <i>affine</i>, <i>Thuidium
  delicatulum, Leucbryum  glaucum </i>and unidentified species of
<i>Dicranum</i> and<i> Polytrichum,</i> all on soil,<i> Hedwigia 
ciliata</i> on sandstone and<i> Dicranum  viride</i> and an
unidentified <i>Entodon</i> on bases of Northern Red Oak. An
unidentified species of <i> Russula</i> was the only fungus seen.</p>
<p>	Both the song and the call of the Veery
(<i> Catharus  fuscescens</i>)  were heard frequently, also  the song
of the Hermit Thrush  (<i>Catharus  guttatus</i>)  and the call of
the Great Crested Flycatcher  (<i>Myiarchus  crinitus</i>).  Ravens
were also heard frequently in a great variety of sounds. Butterflies
included a colorful fritillary, possibly the Atlantis (<i> Speyeria 
atlantis</i>),  and a number of rapidly moving yellow swallowtails.</p>
<p> In our second traverse
we made a loop to the east,  first climbing the slope of the local
prominence above  and perhaps reaching an elevation of the order of a
100 feet  (30 m)  above the road. This hill appeared at least in part
to be underlain by a reddish mudstone with thin beds of siltstone. It
is likely that these rocks are part of the Pocono Formation of
Mississippian age  (Rader and Evans, 1993).  Characteristically the
mismanagement of the U S Forest Service here has allowed a large open
scar to continue eroding and depositing mud and silt down-slope &ndash;
as was particularly evident after the hard rain.</p>
<p>	The canopy
on this slope was much as below, but more open. Northern Red Oak was
virtually the only canopy species and Striped Maple dominated the
understory. Some Bear Oak  (<i>Quercus  ilicifolia</i>)  also
occurred at the forest edge. Other species successively noted were
Whorled Loosestrife  in bloom, Mountain Aster, Crinkled Hairgrass,
abundant Witch Hazel, a little May Apple  ( <i>Podophyllum  peltatum</i>), <i>Carex  gracilescens</i> and Lovage in bloom. Here a soil sample
 (no 2)  was collected. This soil appeared similar to that of no 1, 
with organic matter well integrated. Initial pH was 4.7 and the same
value was obtained 23 hours later.</p>
<p>Continuing,
we saw Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago  rugosa</i>),  Curtis
Goldenrod, the woodrush<i> Luzula  multiflora</i>, abundant White
Snakeroot, particularly in semi-openings; then Woodland Meadow
Parsnip, more Lovage, the moss <i>Dicranum  viride</i>, Mountain
Bindweed in bloom and the fungus<i> Trametes  versicolor</i> on
rotting oak. Following were Virginia Waterleaf (<i> Hydrophyllum 
virginianum </i>), Downy Wood Violet, Wild Geranium, Steele's
Meadowrue  ( <i>Thalictrum  steeleanum</i>),  abundant Mealy
Bellwort, Nodding Fescue, Black Cohosh and Columbine  (<i>Aquilegia 
canadensis</i>),  also in bloom. Next seen were Upland Low Blueberry
(<i> Vaccinium  pallidum </i>),  the Cabbage White Butterfly (<i>
Pieris  rapae</i>),  Purple Bedstraw, the mosses<i> Leucodon 
julaceus</i> and <i>Platygyrium  repens</i> on rotting Northern Red
Oak, an Eastern Phoebe<i>  (Sayornis  phoebe</i> ),  again abundant
Mealy Bellwort, Black Flies  (Simuliidae),  seedlings of Mountain
Ash, an unidentified goldenrod  (<i>Solidago</i>  sp),  a patch of
Yarrow  (<i>Achillea  millefolium </i>), vigorous Poke Milkweed in
full bloom and an unidentified Satyr butterfly (<i> Euptychia</i>  sp).</p>
<p>Our overnight here was
memorable for the abundance of biting and otherwise annoying insects
that exceeded anything this reporter had experienced in the
Appalachians. Among these legions mosquitoes led both in numbers and
time of presence. They grew in number as darkness fell and were
accompanied by both  Black Flies and Punkies  (Ceratopogonidae ?), 
while midges  (Chironomidae ?) swarmed during daylight hours.
Compensating somewhat were the songs, as day broke, of Veeries and a
number of unidentified birds.</p>
<p> In midmorning of 
6-14-00 an inventory was done of a gently sloping bench that
overlooks the South Branch of the Potomac Valley. Elevation here is
also near 4200 feet and the aspect west, although almost flat. The
area inventoried was of the order of an acre  (0.4 ha),  and weather
conditions were sunny, cool and pleasant.</p>
<p>As at the
previously inventoried sites, the canopy consisted almost entirely of
squat, contorted Northern Red Oak, here in a very open distribution
on a field of jumbled sandstone blocks. Other very minor canopy
species consisted of Red Maple and Black Birch, whereas Striped Maple
dominated the undestory with scattered Hophornbeam  (<i>Ostrya 
virginiana</i>),  Choke Cherry  and Mountain Ash. Shrubs were diverse
and included abundant Witch Hazel, blooming Mountain Laurel, Mountain
Holly, Red Raspberry, Allegheny Blackberry, Minnie-bush, Upland Low
Blueberry, Early Low Blueberry  (<i>Vaccinium  angustifolium) </i>
and Black Huckleberry (<i> Gaylussacia </i> <i>bacatta</i>).  The
only vines seen were Common and Hispid Greenbriers  (<i>Smilax 
rotundifolia</i>  and  <i>S.  hispida</i>). </p>
<p>Herbs noted
were abundant  Fly Poison in bloom, Hay-scented Fern, White
Snakeroot, Mountain Aster, Curtis Goldenrod, Plume Lily, Mountain
Bellwort  (<i>Uvularia  pudica</i>),  Arrow-leaf Aster  (<i>Aster 
sagittifolius</i>),  Creeping Five-leaf, Bigleaf Aster, Sweet-scented
Bedstraw  (<i>Galium  triflorum</i>),  Whorled Loosestrife, Nodding
Fescue, the uncommon grass<i> Calamagrostis  porteri</i>, Bunchflower
 (<i>Veratrum  parviflorum </i>),<i> Carex</i>  <i>gracilescens</i>,
Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed (<i> Eupatorium  purpureum </i>), Allegheny
Crowfoot (<i> Ranunculus  allegheniensis </i>), very abundant
blooming Crinkled Hairgrass, Canada Mayflower (<i> Maianthemum 
canadese </i>), Painted Trillium (<i> Trillium  undulatum</i>), 
Indian Cucumberroot  (<i>Medeola  virginiana</i>),  a little Common
Burdock  (<i>Arctium  minus</i>),  Rock Fern, Carrion Flower (<i>
Smilax  herbacea</i>),  Wild Sarsaparilla,  Four-leaved Yam (
<i>Dioscorea</i>  <i>quaternata</i>),  <i>Carex  pensylvanica, C. 
appalachica</i>, the alien Canada Bluegrass (<i> Poa  compressa </i>),
very abundant Mountain Oatgrass and,on rock, the following: <i>Carex 
communis</i>, Wild Liveforever, Southern Bellflower and a little of
the forest bluegrass <i>Poa  alsodes</i>.</p>
<p>Rocks here
bore a number of conspicuous macro-lichens, including <i>Lasalia 
umbilicaria</i> and an unidentified species of <i>Xanthoparmelia</i>.
Mosses noted were <i>Leucobryum  glaucum, Dicranum  viride,
Poltrichum  juniperinum</i> and an unidentified <i>Polytrichum.</i></p>
<p>The floras of these three sites are
characterized by a combination of northern, montane and southern /
widespread species in a decidedly acidic environment. However soils
in the first two sites inventoried appear quite rich, as indicated by
the presence of Black Cohosh, Mealy Bellwort, Columbine and other
mesic herbs, and this may reflect a moderately good nutrient source
such as the observed mudstone in these areas. However the canopy
species are severely restricted, apparently by low growing season
temperatures and high winds  that result from these elevations. It
appears that taller woody plants in general bear the brunt of these
conditions since most woody vines common to lower elevations also do
not occur as well.</p>

<h2>Return to Reddish Knob
and Vicinity</h2>
<ul>
<p>Described here are two major
inventories, including one along the Bald Mountain Road and one done
during an ascent of  Reddish Knob. Minor inventories at a camp site
near Sugar Grove and one at the junction of FR 85 and State Route 924
 (Briery Branch Gap)  are also included.</p>
 </ul>
<h2>Bald Mountain Road</h2>
 
<p><b>Source walk: 8-20-01 </b>
<ul>
</p>
 This inventory traverse began at 12:30 at the Bald
Mountain Road &ndash; FR 85 junction, extended about1/3 mile  ( 0.5
km)  along the Road and included two forest interior sites at this
point.</p>
<p>	Elevation at the start of the traverse was about 3950 feet  (
1205 m)  asl on a very gentle slope to the south. The terrain along
the Road was quite open, and plant density and diversity were highest
on the east road bank. This condition is reflected in our inventory's
results.</p>
<p>	Unfortunately, time did not permit a thorough survey of bedrock
and soil conditions.  However an impression was gained of quite sandy
soil with only modest rock content along the roadway Unfortunately
also, the road bank had  recently been treated with herbicide to
suppress the vegetation  (a contribution of the ignorant and
irresponsible Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries). 
However, although damaged, most this vegetation still remained and
could be identified.</p>
<p>	Initially conspicuous on the road-side were contorted and stunted
Northern Red Oak, smaller White Pine, Table Mountain Pine (<i>Pinus
pungens</i>) and Red maple. The fungus Spotted Bolete  (<i>Boletus 
affinis</i>)  was found by us under Northern Red Oak. On the open
east bank we saw Turkey Beard  (<i>Xerophyllum  asphodeloides </i>)
and at the forest edge, Canada Hemlock, with some Adelgid
infestation, Mountain Fetterbush and  large, vigorous Witch Hazel.
Then again in the open, were abundant Wild Sarsaparilla, Boott's
Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago  boottii </i>), Curtis' Goldenrod, Mountain
Oat Grass, White Snakeroot in full bloom and Whorled Loosestrife.
Where tall plants were few, mosses and lichens proliferated and were
punctuated by plants of Teaberry  (<i>Gaultheria  procumbens </i>)
and Trailing Arbutus  (<i>Epigaea  repens</i>). </p>
<p>	Moving onward, we saw Pitch Pine  (<i>Pinus  rigida </i>),  the
excellently edible fungus S<i>uillus  pictus</i>  (which is said to
favor White Pine),  then <i> Laccaria  laccata</i>, which is also
edible, and  is usually  found - as here-&quot;on waste soil under
conifers&quot; (Phillips, 1991).  Again, at the forest edge, there
was Striped Maple, and, in more open areas, Dwarf Iris (<i> Iris 
verna</i>),  Tree Clubmoss (<i> Lycopodium  obscurum</i>),  Early Low
Blueberry, Featherbells (<i> Stenanthium  gramineum </i>) in bloom;
then Black Huckleberry, Minnie-bush, Black Chokeberry  (<i>Aronia
melanocarpa</i> ),  the dry environment indicator haircap
<i>Polytrichum  juniperinum</i>, Sassafras (<i> Sassafras  albidum</i>), Bear Oak and more Upland Low Blueberry.</p>
<p>	Next seen were Black Birch, Silverrod  (<i>Solidago  bicolor</i>) in bloom, Slender Goldenrod, also in bloom, the
preposterously-named &quot;Cow Wheat&quot;  (<i>Melampyrum  linrare
</i>), Bracken Fern  (<i>Ptridium  aquilinum </i>),  the aromatic
fungus<i> Russula  fragrantissima</i>, followed by Ground Pine,
abundant seedlings of Northern Red Oak and Mountain Bellwort.</p>
<p>	We now saw a succession of fungi that included an unidentified
species of<i> Cortinarius </i> (but see later),  the edible puffball
<i>Lycoperdon  perlatum, Lactarius  chrysorrheus, Lactarius 
lignyotis</i>  (some variants are found in spruce bogs, according to
Phillips)  and the very poisonous <i>Amanita  virosa</i>  (Destroying
Angel). </p>
<p>	After traversing the 1/3 mile, the Road was intersected at a
small angle on its west side by a marked trail. Elevation at the
Road-trail intersection was about 3850 feet  (1174 m)  asl. This
trail was now followed down-slope toward the northwest for perhaps
1/5 mile  (0.3 km).  The canopy along the trail at first consisted of
small, likely young, Northern Red Oak, Black Birch and Hemlock, with
the largest trees about 12 inches  (0.3 m)  dbh. Ameican Chestnut
sprouts and Mountain Holly formed an understory, while a  shrub layer
was comprised of Mountain Laurel, Mountain Fetterbush and Witch
Hazel, while sparse ground cover included Mountain Aster, Teaberry,
Medeola, scattered Painted Trillium and seedlings of Cucumbertree 
(<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>). </p>
<p>	At an elevation of perhaps 3800 feet  (1160 m)  a soil
temperature measurement  (T-210)  was made and a soil sample taken.
The temperature, at a depth of 5 inches  (13 cm)  was 17.0 deg C. The
soil sample, from a depth of 2-3 inches  (5-8 cm)  had a pH of 4.0.
This soil was of the mor type and rich in sandstone fragments.</p>
<p>	Also collected here was the first of our bryophyte samples, which
were to be identified under the microscope by R. Hunsucker. As in all
our samples, liverworts are identified by the symbol (Li). Found in
sample number 1, from the bark of various hardwoods, were the
following:</p>
 <ul>
<p><i>Brachythecium  oxycladon, Dicranum  viride, Frullania 
asagrayana (Li), Hypnum  pallescens, Platygyrium  repens</i></p>
</ul>
<p>	Found in the vicinity of this sample were Painted Trillium,
Mountain Bellwort and the fungus <i>Amanita  virosa.</i></p>

<p>	Bryophyte sample number 2 was now collected from soil over
sandstone, yielding:</p>
<ul>
<p><i>Chiloscyphus  profundus</i> (Li), <i> Hedwigia  ciliata</i>, <i>Hypnum 
curvifolium, Hypnum  pallescens</i>, <i>Leucobryum  glaucum</i>, 
 <i>Polytrichum  ohioense</i>, <i>Ulota  hutchinsiae</i></p>
</ul>
<p>	The <i>Hypnum</i> was quite conspicuous and Hemlock seedlins
common here.</p>
<p>	We next came upon Black Bear (<i> Ursus  americanus</i>)  scat,
grayish-brown in color and with the appearance of decayed moss, but
likely composed of other vegetable matter. In any case, it had only a
faint odor and appeared to consist entirely of short plant fibers. 
</p>
<p>	Subsequently sample 3 was collected from the bark of Table
Mountain Pine  (a minor component here)  and Hemlock; but only the
following were found:</p>
<ul>
<p><i>Dicranella</i> sp  (sterile)  on Hemlock base,<i> Hypnum 
pallescens</i></p>
</ul>
<p>	Also seen here were Juncos, and on soil intergrowths of <i>
Polytrichum, Hypnum</i> and<i> Leucobryum</i> mosses, as identified
by the unaided eye.</p>

<p>	As we moved along the trail,  Chestnut Oak became conspicuous
both as mature trees and as seedlings. Accompanying  these were
scattered Black Locust, large, vigorous Witch Hazel, abundant
Mountain Laurel and Mountain Fetterbush, some Upland Low Blueberry,
seedlings of Mountain Holly and the fungus <i>Leotia  lubrica</i>  ("Jelly
Babies"). </p>
<p>	Bryophyte sample number 4 was next collected from soil, and the
following species were identified:</p>
<ul>
<p><i>Dicranella  heteromalla, Hypnum  curvifolium, Leucobryum 
glaucum, Polytrichum  commune</i></p>
</ul>
<p>	This was followed by sample number 5 from the bark of several
undifferentiated hardwoods, which bore the following:</p>
<ul>
<p><i>Brachythecium  oxycladon, Campylium  chrysophyllum, Dicranella 
heteromalla, Frullania  asagrayana (Li)</i>, <i> Frulannia  brittoniae (Li), Hypnum  pallescens, Platygyrium 
repens, Thuidium  delicatulum, Ulota  crispa</i></p>
</ul>
<p>	Collected in the same vicinity from a variety of down wood was
bryophyte sample 6, which contained:</p>
<ul>
<p><i>Dicranella  heteromalla, Dicranum  viride, Frullania 
asagrayana (Li), Homomallium  adnatum, Hypnum  pallescens,
Platygyrium  repens, Rhodobryum  roseum</i></p>
</ul>
<p>	At this point we ended our traverse and retraced our steps to the
Road. After identifying more Crinkled Hairgrass, we continued south
along the Road for perhaps 100 feet  (30 m) and again entered the
forest, but this time on the east side. The elevation here was near
3800 feet  (1160 m)  and the forest quite different from that on the
Road's west side. Here were large  (two feet / 0.6 m or more dbh), 
widely spaced Northern Red Oak with heavy contorted and frequently
broken limbs. A gentle slope with a southeast aspect featured a large
spring or seep with a substantial discharge along a shallow swale but
with little or no channel.  The presence of this spring had led the
construction of a small pond a considerable number of years ago.</p>
<p>	First noted in the ground flora of dryer areas was abundant
<i>Calamagrostis  porteri</i>, then the edible fungus <i>Cantharellus
</i> <i>cinnabarinus,</i> and in the seep area, the manna grass
<i>Glyceria  melicaria</i>. Also noted was the edible fungus <i>Mycena
 pura</i> growing under a Red Maple.</p>
<p>	Our bryophyte sample 7 was collected here from a variety of
substrates and, as expected, contained a diverse flora as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p><i>Brachythecium  rutabulum</i>, <i>Bryhnia  graminicolor</i>, <i>Chiloscyphus 
cuspidatus</i> (Li), <i>Chiloscyphus  profundus</i> (Li), <i>Dicranella  heteromalla</i>, <i>Hypnum  imponens</i>, <i>Leucobryum  glaucum</i>, <i>Mnium  cuspidatum</i>, <i>Scapania  nemorosa</i> (Li), <i>Sematophylum  adnatum</i>, <i>Thuidium  delicatulum</i></p>
</ul>
<p>	Canopy trees noted in addition to the large Northern Red oak were
Black Oak (<i> Quercus  velutina </i>), Chestnut Oak and, as already
mentioned, Red Maple. Hemlock occurred mostly as small understory
saplings, while shrubs included large Witch Hazel and, in places,
dense thickets of Mountain Laurel and Mountain Fetterbush, which
signaled the relatively thin canopy here. Other common herbs were
Autumn Bent Grass  (<i>Agrostis  perennans</i>),  Sweet White Violet
 (<i>Viola  blanda </i>), <i>Medeola</i>, Crooked-stem Aster  (<i>Aster
 prenanthoides</i>),  Cinnamon Fern  (<i>Osmunda  cinnamomea</i>), 
Trail Rush (<i>Juncus  tenuis</i>),  Lady Fern  (<i>Athyrium  filix-femina</i>
), Downy Wood Violet, <i>Carex  radiata</i> and Wild Sarsaparilla.
Associated with the manna grass on the wettest ground, were <i>Carex 
gynandra</i>, Turtlehead  (<i>Chelone  glabra</i>)  and the rush
<i>Juncus</i>  <i>effusus</i>. In one place a few plants of the
poisonous Indian Tobacco  (<i>Lobelia  inflata</i>)  were associated
with the equally poisonous fungus Jack-O-Lantern (<i> Omphalotus 
illudens</i>). </p>
<p>	A soil temperature determination (T-211)  was made in the dark,
wet soil of the seep area at the usual depth of five inches.  The
value, T=17.0 deg C obtained, was identical to that found on the
Road's west side at essentially the same elevation and, as here, on a
southerly aspect.</p>
<p>	Continuing our survey, we noted a quite large White Oak and the
widespread occurrence of the sedge <i>Carex gracilescens,</i> which,
according to Strausbaugh and Core (1977) usually occurs in rich
woods. We here also came to a peculiar trampled area surrounding a 10
inch  (0.25 m)  dbh Hemlock. It seems possible that this marked a
location frequented by either White-tailed Deer  (<i>Odocoileus 
viginianus</i>)  or Black Bear attracted by the seep and pond, which
afford unusual foraging and bathing opportunities in this otherwise
dry terrain. A serious omission on our part was our failure to
inspect the area for hair.</p>
<p>	Bryophyte sample 8 was now taken from the bark of White Oak with
the following result:</p>
<ul>
<p><i>Anomodon  attenuatus</i>, <i>Frullania  brittoniae</i> (Li), <i>Frullania 
inflata</i> (Li), <i>Hypnum  pallescens</i>, <i>Platygyrium  repens</i>.</p>
 </ul>
<p>	Immediately following this sample 9 was collected from a large
down bole, from which the following were recorded:</p>
<ul>
<p><i>Anomodon  attenuatus, Dicranum  viride, Frullania  brittoniae,
Hypnum  pallescens, Platygyrium  repens</i></p>
</ul>
<p>Vascular species found in the vicinity were Four-leaved
yam, Mountain Bellwort, Crinkled Hairgrass and Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum  acerifolium</i>). </p>
<p>	A feature of his forest referred to earlier was its thin canopy
and the greater amount of light available when compared to the
younger and more Hemlock-rich forest on the Road's west side. This
greater amount of light may also  have been responsible for the
relative abundance of Chestnut Oak seedlings now observed here.</p>
<p>	Bryophyte sample number 10 was now collected from a number of
Northern Red and Chestnut Oaks, and these yielded the following
diverse assemblage:</p>
<ul>
<p><i>Amblystegium  serpens</i>, <i>Anomodon  attenuatus</i>, <i>Anomodon 
rostratus</i>, <i>Brachythecium  rutabulum</i>, <i>Clasmatodon  parvulus</i>, 
<i>Dicranella  </i>Sp<i>  (sterile),  Dicranum  montanum, Dicranum
 viride, Fissidens  adianthoides, Frullania  asagrayana (Li), </i>
<i>Frullania  eboracensis (Li), Haplohymenium  triste, Hypnum 
pallescens, Leucodon  julaceus, Orthotrichum  pumilum, </i>
<i>Platygyrium  repens, Thuidium  delicatulum.</i></p>
</ul>
<p>	Conspicuous here was dominance of the soil by numerous large
clasts of what appeared to be a dense quartzite. However, sprouting
of vegetation from this soil appeared little hindered, perhaps
because of the ample supply of moisture.</p>
<p>	Bryophyte sample 11 was, like the previous sample, taken from the
bark of a number of oaks. It included the following:</p>
<ul>
<p><i>Anomodon  attenuatus, Campylium  chrysophyllum, Entodon 
compressus, Frullania  eboracensis (Li), Frullania  riparia</i> (Li), <i>Haplohymenium  triste, Hypnum  pallescens, Mnium  cuspidatum,
Platygyrium  repens</i>,  Pottiacaea (sterile)<i>, Pylaisiella 
selwynii</i>, <i>Tortella  humilis</i>.</p>
</ul>
<p>	Sample number 12, from soil in the vicinity of sample 11,
contained only:</p>
<ul>
<p><i>Brachythecium  oxycladon, Dicranum  viride, Tortella  humilis,
Mnium  cuspidatum</i>.</p>
</ul>
<p>	We now returned to the Road and began to make our way back to our
vehicle. However the following bryophyte sample,  (number 13),  was
collected from soil along the Road bank:</p>
<ul>
<p><i>Dicranella  heteromalla, Dicranum  scoparium, Hypnum 
curvifolium, Hypnum  pallescens, Leucobryum  glaucum, Polytrichum 
ohioense, Rhynchostegium  serrulatum</i> </p>
</ul>
<p>	Additional fungi collected on the traverse and later identified
by R. Hunsucker were as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <i>Austroboletus  gracilis</i> &ndash; under oak, pine, Hemlock
<br><i>Boletus  pallidus </i>&ndash; edible, under oak on sandy soil
<br><i>Collybia  confluens</i> -  on fallen leaves and needles
<br><i>Cortinarius  armillatus</i> &ndash; under Black Birch
<br><i>Cortinarius  corrugatus</i> &ndash; in moist deciduous woods
<br><i>Phaeolis  schweinitzii</i> &ndash;  (Dye Polypore),  under Table Mountain Pine; a parasite on conifers
<br><i>Suillus  intermedius</i> &ndash; edible, under pine
 </ul>
<p>	Finally, it must be stressed once more that the Bald Mountain
Road must be closed and obliterated to salvage what remains of the
biodiversity of Shenandoah Mountain and to create the Ernie Dickerman
Wilderness. Virginians for Wilderness have called for this closure
for two decades now, as they have for an end to the destructive and
out-dated policies of the Virginia Department of Game and Inland
Fisheries that are represented by this road.</p>
 </ul>
<h2>Sugar Grove Vicinity</h2>
<b>Source Walks: 8-20-01 and 8-21-01</b>
<ul>
<p>	The following describes a camping interlude and inventory by the
reporter at the base of Shenandoah Mountain, a little east of Sugar
Grove, West Virginia. The site inventoried is adjacent to State Route
25 at the western edge of the US Naval Reservation and near an
intermittent stream. Elevation here is near 2000 feet  (610 m)  asl
and the general aspect is north northwest. The weather was mild,
practically windless and pleasant.</p>
<p>	An unusual experience here &ndash; sadly now increasingly rare &ndash;
was hearing the sound of a Whip- Poor &ndash; Will (<i>Caprimulgus  vociferus</i>). The cries of this bird were first heard very
faintly, as from a great distance, before falling asleep late during
the night of 8-20-01. However, early during the following morning,
after hearing Screech Owls (<i> Otus  asio </i>) all night, a Whip &ndash;
Poor &ndash; Will was clearly heard nearby, but only briefly.</p>
<p>	My camp was located at the base of the steep mountain slope, with
a forest canopy of young White Pine and Sugar  and Red Maples.
Species under this canopy included scattered Autumn Olive  (<i>Elaeagnus
 umbellata </i>), Upland Low Blueberry, Intermediate Shield fern,
Partridge Berry and Common Speedwell  (<i>Veronica  officinallis </i>). The adjacent flood plain contained Sycamore  (<i>Platanus </i>
occidentalis),  Shagbark Hickory  (<i>Carya  ovata </i>), Black
Locust, Sugar Maple, Black Elderberry  (<i>Sambucus  canadensis</i>), as well as other woody plants and a variety of mesic herbs such as
Wingstem  (<i>Verbesina  alternifolia </i>). Farther up-slope, under
White Pine, Partridge Berry, <i>Potentilla  canadensis</i>, a
fruticose <i>Cladina</i> lichen of the &quot;reindeer moss' type and
large patches of the beautiful moss <i>Pleurozium  schreberi
</i>partially covered otherwise bare ground.</p>
<p>	Of interest also, was a large outcrop of non-calcareous,
apparently quite acidic shale. In the open, above this shale, soil
bore abundant Trailing Arbutus as well as the other acidiphiles
previously mentioned.</p>
<p>	At 8:30 AM a soil temperature determination  (T-212)  was made at
the usual depth of 5 inches under White Pine and Sugar Maple. The
result was T= 16.5 deg C., a quite low value for the elevation, and
probably attributable to the northerly aspect and subsiding cool
mountain air. 
</p>
<p>	Other than the night birds mentioned previously, White-breasted
Nuthatch (<i> Sitta  carolinensis</i>),  Wid Turkey  (<i>Meleogris 
gallopavo</i>)  and loudly-drumming but unidentified woodpeckers
enlivened the morning.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Reddish Knob, Base to Summit</h2>
 
<p><b>Source Walks: 8-20-01 and 8-21-01</b></p>
<ul>
 Our inventories here began at about 10:30 AM on 8-20-01
under very cool and partly cloudy conditions. The only birds noted
were ravens sailing over the treetops. A soil temperature
determination (T-209)  was made near the junction of FR85 and the
road to the top of Reddish Knob. The elevation was near 4250 feet (
1296 m)  and the aspect flat. A temperature at the usual depth of 5
inches was 16.0 deg C.</p>
<p>	Our inventory of this area was resumed at 10 :00 AM on 8-21-01,
again under  cool but comfortable conditions. The area covered by an
essentially spot inventory was perhaps an acre  (0.4 ha).  The canopy
here also consisted of stunted and contorted Northern Red Oak of
uncertain age but mature appearance. Other very subordinate canopy
species were Black Cherry   (also of a deformed character and
including seedlings),  Black Birch and Red Maple. The most common
understory tree was Striped Maple, but a little Mountain Ash, mostly
as seedlings, Downy Serviceberry and Mountain holly were also seen.
While shrubs were not abundant, there was some Witch Hazel, Mountain
Fetterbush and Red Raspberry with ripe fruit. Seedlings of an
unidentified hawthorn were also present.</p>
<p>	The only woody vine was Hispid Greenbrier and the most common
herb beautifully blooming Mountain Aster. Other herbs were yellow
Clintonia, very abundant Hay-scented Fern, Crinkled Hairgrass, Fly
Poison, Four-leaved Yam, Curtis Goldenrod, Mountain Bindweed, Indian
Turnip, an unusual four-leaved Painted Trillium with red fruit, <i>Carex
 gracilescens,</i> the grass <i>Calamagrostis  porteri</i>, Canada
Mayflower, Rock Fern, Indian Pipe  (<i>Monotropa  uniflora </i>), a
patch of New york Fern (<i> Thelypteris  noveboracensis </i>), Bunch
flower, Whorled Loosestrife, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Stary Campion (<i>
Silene  stellata</i>)  and Filmy Angelica. Also seen were the fungi
<i>Amanita  vaginata, Boletus  affinis, Scleroderma  citrinum </i>and
<i>Collybia  confluens.</i> Fire scars were noted at the bases of
several oaks.</p>
<p>	Bryophyte sample 14, from the bark of Northern Red Oak, bore the
following species:</p>
 <ul>
<p><i>Anomodon  attenuatus, Brachythecium  rutabulum, Brotherella 
tenuirostris, Dicranum  viride, Entodon  brevisetus </i> (uncommon) <i>,</i></p>
<p><i>Frullania  asagrayana (Li), Hypnum  pallescens, Mnium 
cuspidatum, Platygyrium  repens, Thuidium  delicatulum, Ulota  crispa</i>.</p>
 </ul>
<p>Also obtained here was bryophyte sample 15, from
sandstone:</p>
 <ul>
<p><i>Dicranella  heteromalla, Dicranum  fulvum, Hedwigia  ciliata,
Hypnum  pallescens, Orthotrichum  pumilum, Platygyrium  repens,
Thuidium  delicatulum</i>.</p>
 </ul>
<p>	We now began our ascent of Reddish knob via the road along its
east side. Our inventory was in part a repeat of a less extensive one
of 9-6-95. As reported at that time, the vegetation, especially along
the lower and middle part of the climb, is quite mesic in character.
Noted in succession during our ascent were Pennsylvania Blackberry  (
<i>Rubus pensilvanicus </i>)  (which may have been misidentified as<i>
R.  canadensis</i> by this reporter on 9-6-95),  Basil Balm,
Columbine in bloom at the road edge, and possibly influenced by
limestone gravel, Yellow Birch, Horse Balm, Black Cohosh, Virginia
Waterleaf, Pale Jewelweed  (<i>Impatiens  pallida</i>)  with
bumblebees in attendance, abundant Thin-leaved Sunflower, Nodding
fescue, an unidentified hawthorn with half-ripe fruit covered by
fungus, Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed in slightly faded bloom, an
unidentified two-meter- tall meadowrue  (<i>Thalictrum</i>  sp), 
abundant, vigorous Filmy Angelica, a Red Admiral  (<i>Vanessa 
atalanta</i>)  Butterfly, Honewort  (<i>Cryptotaenia  canadensis </i>),
abundant White Snakeroot in full bloom and vigorous, tall Wood Nettle
 (<i>Laportea  canadensis</i>).  As many of these mesic species
occurred on the steep slope above the road, it seems unlikely that
they were influenced by it.</p>
<p>	As we rounded the road's curve to the west, we encountered a
steep, open slope with a more southerly exposure. Vegetation here
underwent a change to a less mesic type, which may have been in part
the result of misguided human intervention in the form of clipping
most of it short. Amidst numerous sprouts of Northern Red Oak were
Beaked Hazelnut, Upland Low Blueberry, Poison Ivy and Virginia
Creeper  (<i>Parthenocissus  quinquefolia </i>) with brilliantly red
leaves in an early display, perhaps as a consequence of the high
elevation. Herbs were represented by Southern Bellflower, Stiff Aster
and Blue Wood aster. Farther along, on a more southerly exposure,
there was Common Milkweed  (<i>Asclepias  syriaca </i>), its leaves
almost consumed by larvae of the Monarch Butterfly (<i> Donous 
plexippus </i>). Here also was Mountain Laurel, Upland Willow  (<i>Salix
 humilis </i>), the alien Morrow's Honeysuckle  (<i>Lonicera 
morrowii </i>), an unidentified gooseberry  (R<i>ibes</i>  sp)  and
heavy growths of Wild Liveforever and Silverrod, both in spectacular
bloom. Other species included Rough Heuchera,  (<i>Heuchera  hispida</i>
), also in bloom, Little Bluestem  (<i>Andropogon  scoparium</i>), 
Virgin's Bower (<i> Clematis  virginiana</i>)  and White Heath Aster
 (<i>Aster  pilosus</i>  var <i> demotus</i>). </p>
<p>	On the north slope, immediately beneath the summit, we saw
Hairgrass  (<i>Agrostis  hyemalis</i>)  and <i>Calamagrostis 
porteri,</i> both in fruit, and the latter making a good display of
its characteristics against the sky  (photo).  Accompanying these
were  Stary Campion. And a butterfly that was either a Painted Lady (<i>
Vaessa  cardui</i>)  or an American Painted Lady  (<i>V. 
virginiensis </i>).</p>
<p>	A spot inventory was now conducted in the interior of the forest
of dwarf Northern Red Oak immediately below the summit on the west
side. As previously noted, Northern Red oak here is about 20 feet  (6
m)  in height. Other woody species were Striped Maple, Smooth
Seviceberry   (<i> Amelanchier  laevis</i>),  Choke Cherry, Witch
Hazel, Mountain Laurel, Mountain Fetterbush, Mountain Holly and Red
Elderberry  (<i>Sambucus  pubens</i>),  a species of dryer habitats
than Black Elderberry and not, as the latter, adapted to warm as well
as cold climates. Hispid Greenbrier was the only woody vine seen but
herbs included Crinkled Hairgrass, Mountain Bindweed, blooming
Mountain Aster, White Snakeroot, Wild Sarsaparilla, Whorled
Loosestrife, Hay-scented Fern, Autumn Bent Grass and the sedge<i>
Carex  </i>pensylvanica. <i>Boletus  affinis </i>was the only fungus
identified with confidence.</p>
<p>	A soil temperature determination  (T-213)  here on a steep slope
with a west aspect yielded T= 15.5 deg C.</p>
<p>	A rapid survey was also executed by R. Hunsucker of the fringe of
human-induced vegetation around the summit parking lot. In the
following list of this vegetation introduced species are
distinguished by an asterisk.</p>
 
<br>*<i>Plantago  major</i>  (Great
Plantain) 
<br>*<i>Verbascum  thapsus </i> (Great Mullein)  

<br>*<i>Bromus  tectarum</i>  (Downy Chess)
<br>*<i>Taraxacum  officinale</i>  (Common
Dandelion) 
<br>  <i> Oxalis  stricta </i> (Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel) 
<br>*<i>Cirsium  vulgare </i> (Common Thistle)

<h2>Junction of FR 85 and State Route 924 At Briery Branch Gap</h2>
<p><b>Source Walk: 8-21-01</b></p>
<ul>
<p>	On our arrival at the junction we were treated to a sighting of
Cedar Waxwings (<i>Bombycilla  cedrorum</i>) in the open. We then
noted again that the surrounding forest was largely young, with an
uneven-age canopy, but with some mature trees. Selected for our
inventory was a forest interior site immediately south of the road
junction, at an elevation of about 3800 feet  (1160 m)  and with a
north aspect, The canopy here consisted of somewhat Adelgid-infested
Hemlock, Red Maple, Black Birch, Northern Red and White Oaks and
White Pine. Some Black Oak was noted as well. Hemlock, White Pine and
the oaks were generally the largest trees, attaining dbh values of 20
inches  (0.5 m)  or more. Striped Maple and a little Downy
Serviceberry constituted an understory and Mountain Holly, Witch
Hazel, Mountain Laurel and Mountain Fetterbush a shrub layer.
Although the ground flora was sparse as a consequence of the shade,
herbs included Shining Clubmoss (<i> Lycopodium  lucidulum</i>), 
Mountain Bellwort, Canada Mayflower, Ground Pine,<i> Medeola</i>,
Wild sarsaparilla, Carrion flower, Indian Pipe, Fly Poison and
Partridge Berry. Fungi included an unidentified<i> Russula, Amanita 
flavoconia </i>and <i>Leotia  lubrica.</i></p>
<p>	Although somewhat late in the day, at 2:00 AM, for our
comparative study, a soil temperature determination  (T-214)  was
made in the forest interior, on the north-facing slope and at the
usual depth of 5 inches. The result, T = 15.5 deg C. was identical to
that we had obtained earlier on a west aspect near the Reddish Knob
summit.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
 <ul>
 While unique in many of their features, the high elevation
forests of Shenandoah Mountain have much in common with other Central
Appalachian oak forests. Where they differ greatly is in their canopy
composition and low species diversity. The general characteristics of
the woody components of these forests have been discussed at some
length by Stephenson and Adams  (1989, 1991).  Although recognized
earlier by Ayres and Ashe  (1905),  Braun  (1950)  and others, these
authors have emphasized the virtual monopoly among oaks of Northern
Red Oak at elevations above 4000 feet  (1220 m)  asl. This feature is
compatible with the geographic range of this species, which extends
farther north than that of any other oak in eastern North America.</p>
<p>	It was inevitable that most of these forests be developed on
highly siliceous bedrock, since this rock is most resistant to
erosion and thus underlies the highest ridges. As a consequence, and
as shown by Stephenson and Adams  (1989),  most of these forests
occur on highly acidic soils, although there is considerable
variation in pH values. As may be seen in our report, this variation
is reflected predominantly in the shrub and herb communities, while
the canopy shows comparatively little. The highest soil pH values
found by us fall in the range of  5, and occur where there are quite
diverse communities of herbs.</p>
<p>	A problem with these forests, inherited from the past, is the
extent to which their present character, particularly with respect to
canopy species, is related to the loss of the American Chestnut as a
result of infection by the fungal parasite <i>Endothia  parasitica
</i>during the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Although
Chestnut sprouts and dead remains are frequently tallied in our
inventories of the high elevation oak forests, the extent to which
this tree once populated the canopy is difficult to determine now.
Stephenson<i> et al</i>  (1991, 1993)  provided an excellent
overview, particularly with regard to the possibility of the return
of this noble tree to our forests. It appears that the most promising
mechanism to accomplish this may be through the spread and
establishment of a hypovirulent  (greatly weakened)  strain of <i>E. 
parasitica</i>, which would replace the currently prevalent more
virulent strain.</p>
<p>	In addition to geologic substrate other important factors in the
distribution of forest types in the Central Appalachians are
temperature, precipitation and cloud cover. While these factors are
interrelated, independent data exist for each. A feature of the
Appalachians is the northeast &ndash; southwest orientation of
isotherms over much of the region  (U. S. Dept. of Commerce, 1966). 
Consequently the greatest drop  in temperature may occur  in going
from east to west or vice versa rather than from south to north.
Because the lowest temperatures in the Central Appalachians occur in
West Virginia's Alleghenies, temperatures at any given elevation
there are likely to be lower  than those at  the same elevation on
Shenandoah Mountain. In general this is reflected in the relative
numbers of northern and high montane species found in the two
regions.. To a degree also, Shenandoah Mountain lies in the rain
shadow of the high Alleghenies, although the  elevation of the former
probably  enables it to intercept more precipitation than the lower
ranges in the vicinity. It also lies considerably east of the Central
Appalachian cloudy-day maximum  (Reifsnyder and Lull, 1965),  which
also falls in the region of the high Alleghenies. As suggested
earlier  (Mueller, 1994),  this factor may contribute to the more
mesic character of the Allegheny forests in comparison to those of
the Valley and Ridge, including Shenandoah Mountain.</p>
<p>	Another feature here is the variation of species characteristics
with change of habitat. As previously observed on the Reddish Knob
summit, Northern Red  Oak leaves are thick and leathery there, and
quite unlike the characteristically thin leaves of this species at
lower elevations. It is likely that this is an adaptation to the
severe conditions of bright sunlight, strong winds and rapid
temperature changes which are to be expected in the dwarf, highly
exposed trees of the summit. Also, as noted earlier, these high
elevation forests include few woody vines. In the example of
Shenandoah Mountain, these are virtually confined to Common and
Hispid Greenbriers and, in the sunny exposure near the summit of
Reddish Knob, to Poison Ivy and Virginia Creeper, but with the latter
exhibiting premature loss of chlorophyll, as indicated by its
brilliant leaf color. It should be mentioned that in the high
Alleghenies there are even fewer woody vines than here, perhaps as a
consequence of lower temperatures. A related problem is the
occurrence here of Hispid Greenbrier in very acidic soils, whereas at
lower elevations Saw Brier  (<i>Smilax  glauca </i>) fills this role,
and Hispid Greenbrier is virtually confined to soils with moderate to
high pH values. It is possible that this reversal of habitat
character signals an effect of temperature on the stability of these
species. Perhaps significant is evidence that Hispid Greenbrier may
extend a bit farther north than Saw Brier  (Gleason, 1952). </p>
<p>	Of particular interest are the bryophytes of the Reddish Knob
vicinity forests and their comparison with those of other Central
Appalachian forests. If we examine the tables of bryophyte
frequencies in this forest as well as those for Cathedral State Park,
Tea Creek and two forests of the North River Valley, we find that in
each case<i> </i>the moss <i>Anomodon  attenuatus</i> occurs among
the six most frequent species, although in many other respects the
species present and their frequencies differ considerably and reflect
essential differences in forest type. However, although still quite
different, the Reddish Knob vicinity forest and those of the nearby
North River Valley have a relatively greater affinity to each other,
as is shown by the presence of the additional moss <i> Platygyrium 
repens </i>among the six most frequent species in all three forests.
The most frequent bryophyte species in the Reddish Knob vicinity
forest is the moss <i>Hypnum  pallescens</i>, a species with only low
frequency in the Hemlock - rich forest at Cathedral, but with
moderate frequencies in the  forests at Tea Creek and North River. In
general there appears to be a quite good correspondence between
forest type and bryophyte species' habitat requirements and
ecological characteristics as documented, for example, by Crum and
Anderson  (1981).  
</p>
<p>	The soil temperature determinations which are incorporated into
our inventories here are part of a recently initiated assessment by
us throughout the Central Appalachians. While these data now form an
integral part of our inventories, they are also in the process of
being brought together to gain a thermal picture of the entire region
and for evaluation of their potential use in baseline studies of
climatic and other changes in these forests. Our first project in
this effort is our study &quot;<a href=soiltemperatures>Soil Temperatures and Forest Type</a>&quot;,
which was recently installed on this web page and which compares soil
temperatures from several different forest types and from various
locations throughout the region.</p>
