<h2>General Features</h2>
 <ul>

<p> Southwest of Petersburg, West Virginia,
the South Branch of the Potomac River slices Cave Mountain from the North Fork Range
in a limestone karst area known as the Smoke Hole Country  (Sites, undated).   Legend
has it that the cave opening for which the area is named was once used by
Native Americans to smoke meat.  What is clear is that this area harbors a
unique combination of geologic features and biological communities and that it
is in urgent need of protection and restoration of its   natural integrity.</p>

<p> The terrain
of Smoke Hole has a western appearance and connection.  Its mountains have an
angularity and steepness reminiscent of the Rockies, if not their scale, and its dry golden grasses with
scattered junipers and oaks are a little like California.  More
significantly, it is home to species and biological communities that are disjunct
from similar communities as distant as the mid and far west, as well as some
unique to the Appalachians.  Included are shale and limestone barrens, cedar
glades, glade woodlands, xeric oak forests, mesic forests, rich riparian zones
and abundant caves.  Most of these communities result from the dry alkaline
conditions inherent in limestone karst and the position of the area in the rain
shadow of the high Alleghenies.</p>

<p> The Nature
Conservancy  (1991),  Bartgis  (1993)  and the West Virginia Natural Heritage
Program have documented rare species of Smoke Hole, among them rare disjuncts. 
The cedar glade and limestone barrens include Prairie Flax  (<i>Linum  lewisii</i>) first discovered during the Lewis and Clark expedition and found east of
the Mississippi only on the shores of Hudson Bay and here.  Additional
western disjuncts are Prairie Rocket  (<i>Erysimum asperum</i>), Coopers Milkvetch
 (<i>Astragalis   neglectus</i>), Death Camas  (<i>Zigadenus   elegans</i>)
and the Chestnut Lipfern  (<i>Cheilanthes  castanea</i>).  Also, some plants
such as the sedge <i>Carex   eburnia</i>, Arborvitæ  (<i>Thuja   occidentalis 
</i>) and Snowberry  (<i>Symphoricarpos   alba</i>) are northerners at or
near their southern range limits.  Others — Shale Barren Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago  
harrisii </i>), Yellow Nailwort  (<i>Paronychia virginica</i>), Smoke
Hole Bergamot  (<i>Monarda   fistulosa   brevis</i>) —&nbsp;dominate cedar
glades here but are not found in the West.  And still others such as the
orchid, Crested Coralroot  (<i>Hexalectris   spicata</i>), are southerners
at their northern limit at Smoke Hole. </p>

<p> More common
species, also documented by these sources, are Red Cedar  (<i>Juniperus  virginiana</i>)  Poverty Oat Grass  (<i>Danthonia  spicata</i>),  Thimbleweed  (<i>Anemone  virginiana</i>),  Wild Licorice  (<i>Galium  circaezans</i>)  Nodding Onion  (<i>Allium  cernuum</i>),  Squawweed  (<i>Senecio  obovatus</i>),  Woodland Sunflower  (<i>Helianthus  divaricatus</i>),  Whorled Milkweed  (<i>Asclepias verticillata</i>),  Ebony Spleenwort  (<i>Asplenium 
platyneuron </i>), New Jersey Tea  (<i>Ceanothus  americanus</i>),  Hairy Beardtongue  (<i>Penstemon  hirsutus</i>) and Thoroughwort Bricklebush  (<i>Brickellia eupatorioides</i>). </p>

<p> Fauna associated with these plant communities include rare butterflies such as the
Columbine Duskywing  (<i>Erynnis   lucilius </i>) and the Cobweb Skipper  (<i>Hesperia  metea</i>).  Caves in the area harbor the Endangered Indiana and Virginia
Big-eared Bats  (<i>Myotis  sodalis</i>  and  <i>Corynorhinus  townsendii  virginianus</i>)  and the endemic South Branch Cave Millipede  (<i>Pseudotremia princeps</i>). 
The South Branch of the Potomac, enriched by the carbonate rocks in its
watershed, constitutes a diverse aquatic ecosystem with abundant fish, bird
life, including Osprey (<i>Pandion  haliaetus</i>)   and a mollusk fauna with
rare mussels such as the Brook Floater  (<i>Alasmidonta  varicose</i>).</p>

<h2>Cave Mountain 
Northwest of  Landes, West Virginia</h2> 
<ul>
<p><b>Source Walk: 9-7-94</b></p>

<p> Just north of
Landes,
 West Virginia a rough gravel road ascends Cave Mountain to
its crest.  From there a trail descends the northwest slope to the rim of the
South Branch gorge. The road and trail pass over steep, rocky terrain that has
been much degraded by unwise agricultural and forestry practices, particularly
overgrazing.  An effort was made here to find and identify not only the rarer
species referred to earlier but also to gain a broad if hasty picture of the
more common members of these communities.</p>

<p> The first
cedar glade/limestone barren-type community was encountered about two road
miles (3.2 km) from the main highway (US 220).  Trees here are Chinquapin Oak (<i>Quercus  muehlenbergii</i>)  and Red Cedar,  with Fragrant Sumac  (<i>Rhus  
aromatica</i>) as the only shrub noted.  Herbs were Wild Senna (<i>Cassia  hebecarpa), </i>Tinkers-weed   (<i>Triosteum  perfoliatum</i>), Elm-leaf Goldenrod   (<i>Solidago  
ulmifolia </i>), False Gromwell   (<i>Onosmodium   hispidissimum</i>),
Shale-barren Pussytoes (<i> Antennaria  virginica</i>) and <i>Carex   eburnia</i>. 
Squaw-weed (<i>Senecio   obovatus</i>) and Rock Twist  (<i>Draba   ramasissima</i>) occur in the adjacent oak forest which was not further characterized.</p>

<p> After perhaps
a mile (1.6 km) hike to near the gorge rim a more extensive, diverse and less degraded 
community was encountered.  Although Red Cedar is an important component of
this community, it would be classified as a limestone barren, according to the
Nature Conservancy criteria, because it is dominated by grasses which are
essentially of the western prairie.  The most abundant of the grasses is Yellow
Indian Grass  (<i>Sorghastrum   nutans</i>), with Big Bluestem  (<i>Andropogon 
gerardi),  </i>Little Bluestem  (<i>A.  scoparius</i>) and Side-oats Grama (<i>Bouteloua   curtipendula</i>) forming isolated patches or scattered
throughout. </p>

<p> This barren
is on northwest-sloping terrain at an elevation of a little over 1700 ft. (520
meters) with an impressive view to the north of distant cliffs on the gorge
wall and of the Bulls Head, a local prominence of 2757 ft (840 meter)
elevation.  At this season the golden-hued, tall grasses against the dark
cedars and the mountain backdrop is particularly striking.</p>

<p> In addition
to the Red Cedar, Chinquapin Oak, Black Walnut  (<i>Juglans  nigra</i>),  Black
Locust (<i>  Robinia  pseudoacacia</i>),  White Ash  (<i>Fraxinus  americana</i>), Hackberry  (<i>Celtis   occidentalis</i>) and White, Pitch and Virginia
Pines   (<i>Pinus  strobus, P.</i>  <i>rigida</i> and <i>P.  virginiana</i>) 
form a scattered canopy.  Small trees are represented by Hophornbeam   (<i>Ostrya virginiana</i>)   and Redbud   (<i>Cercis canadensis</i>) .  </p>

<p> Associated
with these trees and prairie grasses are other plants with western ranges as
well as some restricted to eastern forests.  In the first group are Orange Puccoon
 (<i>Lithospermum   canescens</i>), Indian Hemp  (<i>Apocynum   cannabinum</i>), Grooved Flax  (<i>Linum   sulcatum</i>), Thimble Weed  (<i>Anemone</i> 
<i>virginiana</i>) and the shrub Coralberry  (<i>Symphoricarpos  orbiculatus</i>).  In the second group are many small plants hidden among the grasses. 
These include Hairy Panic Grass  (<i>Panicum  villosissimum</i>),   Squaw-weed,
Moss Pink  (<i>Phlox  subulata</i>), Virginia Snakeroot  (<i>Aristolochia  
serpentaria</i>), Nodding Onion  (<i>Alium cernuum</i>), Hog Peanut  (<i>Amphicarpa
</i> <i>bracteata</i>),  Bloodroot  (<i>Sanguinaria  canadensis</i>), 
Wavy-leaf and Heath Asters    (<i>Aster undulates </i> and  <i>A</i>. <i> pilosus
</i>) , Common  Speedwell  (<i>Veronica  officinalis</i>), Shrubby St.
John’s-wort  (<i>Hypericum  prolificum</i>), Downy Woodmint  (<i>Blephila  
ciliata</i>), Arrow-leaf Violet  (<i>Viola   sagittata</i>), the Bush
Clover <i>Lespedeza   nuttallii</i>, the mushroom <i>Hygrophorus   coccineus,  </i>an
unidentified species of Violet  (<i>Viola</i> sp),  Pale Indian Plantain (<i> Cacalia 
atriplicifolia), </i>Bedstraw (<i>Galium</i> sp)  and mosses.  The alien
species Ox-eye Daisy   (<i>Chrysanthemum </i> <i>leucanthemum</i>),  Yellow
Sweet Clover   (<i>Melilotus  officinalis</i>),  Black Medic Clover   (<i>Medicago  
lupulina </i>) and Canada Bluegrass  (<i>Poa compressa</i>)  were
also identified.</p>

<p> The
predominantly deciduous forest that borders this limestone barren, at least on
the south, consists largely of Pignut  (<i>Carya  obovatus</i>  or <i>C.  glabra</i>) and Shagbark  (<i>Carya  ovata</i>)  Hickories and Chinquapin Oak, with
Hop-hornbeam in the understory.  Under these trees an outcrop of thin-bedded
limestone  (probably Tonoloway)   had a few plants of Cliff Brake Fern  (<i>Pell&aelig;a atropurpurea</i>) growing on it.</p>

<p> A small excavation was made to determine
the soil type in the barren.  The soil proved to be very dark brown (slightly
moist) with substantial clay and organic matter content to a depth of at least
a foot  (0.3 meters).   This may border on a prairie soil type.</p>

<p> Save a few
Goldfinches  (<i>Carduelis  tristis </i>), virtually the only fauna noted in
the barren were Chiggers  (<i>Eutrombicula  alfreddugesi</i>),   and these
were not apparent until the area was vacated.  As is generally the case
however, no significant effort was made to record fauna, since such close
concentration was required to identify the flora.</p>

<p> It should be
stressed that while many species in these limestone barrens and cedar glades
may be shared with western habitats such as prairies and that even communities
bear a resemblance to those of the West, many eastern inserts render these
communities quite distinct from  their western counterparts.</p>

<p> An additional
point of interest is the interaction of a carbonate substrate with dry growing
conditions as compared with the interaction of a siliceous substrate with those
conditions.  Among the common elements in the floras of the two environments
are certain tree species such as Pignut and the Pines and some herbaceous plants. 
Otherwise the communities are quite different.</p>

<h2>Shale Barrens</h2>
 <ul>

<p> The shale barrens are extremely dry,
poorly vegetated, open canopy communities of shale slopes and tend to be acidic
rather than alkaline. They tend to occur on shales of Devonian age, but are
also found on Ordovician and Silurian shales.</p>

<p> A large,
well-developed shale barren occupies a steep south-facing slope on red Silurian
shales, which likely are Rose Hill Formation. This occurrence on the Monongahela National Forest,
is dominated by Virginia Pine and Pennsylvania Sedge  (<i>Carex  pensylvanica</i>).  Although there few endemics at this site, there are Shale Barren Pussytoes (<i>Antennaria  virginica</i>),  Mountain Nailwort  (<i>Paronychia  montana</i>)  and Pussytoes Ragwort  (<i>Senecio  antennarifolius</i>),with the latter the
least common.</p>

<p> Devonian shales
of the Mahatango Formation occur near deep Hollow Run. Endemics here are Pussytoes
Ragwort, Kates Mountain Clover,  (<i>Trifolium  virginicum</i>),  Shale Barren
Evening Primrose  (<i>Oenothera  argillicola</i>)  and Bent Milkvetch  (<i>Astragalus 
distortus</i>). </p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
 <ul>

<p> The<b> </b>flora
of  the dolomite and limestone barrens of Southwestern
 Virginia  (Ludwig, 1999)  bears some
resemblance to that of the limestone barrens and cedar glades of the Smoke Hole
Country. Highly characteristic species held in common include the sedge <i>Carex 
eburnea,</i> Crested Coralroot, Big Bluestem, Little Bluestem, Side-oats Grama,
Yellow Indian Grass, Fragrant Sumac, Virginia Snakeroot, Elm-leaf Goldenrod,
Orange Puccoon, Chinquapin Oak and Grooved Flax.  However, several
characteristic species such as the Smoke Hole Bergamot and False Gromwell
apparently do not occur in the Virginia barrens. Also, the latter contain a number of
species, such as the orchid <i>Spiranthes  magnicamporum</i> and the shrub <i>Rhamnus 
laceolata</i>  subspecies  <i>glabrata</i>, which are largely Midwestern in
distribution, but apparently are not found at Smoke Hole. </p>

<p> The xeric
limestone prairies of Pennsylvania  (Laughlin and Uhl, 2003)  are small both as
individual tracts and in total area  (less than one hectare).  They also appear
to be depauperate. However they do contain some species, such as Long-fruited
Anemone  (<i>Anemone  cylindrica </i>), at the southern limit of their
distribution.</p>
