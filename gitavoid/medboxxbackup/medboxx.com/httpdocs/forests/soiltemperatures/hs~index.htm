<h2>Abstract</h2>
 <ul>
<p>
	<p>	For the second
	year soil temperatures are related to several forest types and
	environmental conditions in the Central Appalachian Mountains. As
	during the previous year ( Mueller, 2002 }, the White Pine - Hemlock
	- Hardwood forest with a boreal component at Virginia's Ramsey's
	Draft had growing season soil temperatures lower than those of Oak -
	Hickory Ridge and Mesic Slope forests in the Shenandoah Valley. Soil
	temperatures as well as associated spring and stream water
	temperatures reflected the markedly warmer 2002 summer temperatures
	when compared with those of 2001.<p>
		Accompanying the
	largely warmer 2002 temperatures was a considerable variation in
	precipitation, with an early season abundance giving way to a severe
	summer drought. The resulting soil moisture variation produced
	secondary effects on the soil temperatures. For example, soil
	temperatures in the Mesic Slope forest, dominated by northerly
	aspects, were markedly cooler than in 2001 during the early part of
	the season as a consequence of the greater soil moisture. This
	effect was also apparent at Ramsey's Draft but not in the Oak -
	Hickory Ridge forest. All three forest types exhibited a temporary
	slight rise in soil temperatures in September after temperatures had
	already declined. This late season rise in temperature is
	interpreted as a consequence of exothermic respiration of pent up
	organic matter as a result of decreased respiration during the
	preceding drought. It is thought to have been initiated by an
	observed slight increase in soil moisture, possibly as a result of
	the shortened daylight period.<p>
		The 2002 Deep -
	source Spring temperatures at Ramsey's Draft were of the order of
	one degree C higher than in 2001 for most of the summer. However,
	during late summer they fell well below those of 2001, an effect
	attributable to the truncation by the drought of a shallow water
	component of the spring water.<p>
		Soil temperature
	determinations at several other locations in the mountains fit the
	pattern of 2001, with high elevation/ cool habitat data falling on
	or below the Ramsey's Draft trend, while those of the North River
	Valley lay above. Especially impressive, but not unexpected, is the
	low soil temperature registered at Dolly Sods in West Virginia's
	Allegheny Mountains.<p>
		A particular
	advantage of soil and water temperatures that emerges from the
	expanded data base of the two seasons is their capacity to integrate
	and faithfully reflect several climatic components such as air
	temperatures, moisture availability and, possibly, forest energy
	conversions.<p>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<ul>
<p>
	<p><BR>
	<p><B>	</B>In the
	my treatment of the 2001 data it was opined that soil and air
	temperatures were relatively independent of each other in the short
	term, While this may be true on a scale of hours or even days, it is
	only apparently so, as a consequence of heat exchange lag. The
	nature of the major response of soil to air temperature is well
	established ( Armson, 1979 ) and is too obvious to require
	discussion here. However, small scale responses to a number of
	climatic perturbations are not only complex, but of considerable
	importance to forest ecology. In the 2001 data the primary relations
	observed were the topographic and elevational effects and the
	correlations between soil temperature and 
	<p>forest type.
	Secondary effects were short term soil temperature variations and
	inferred associated heat release and absorption. Also of interest
	was the smooth curve obtained for the temperature of the water that
	issued from a prominent spring, as well as the time lag of this
	temperature relative to the soil temperature, features which led the
	writer to dub this a &quot;Deep - source Spring.&quot;<p>
		The 2002 season,
	in contrast to that of 2001, was characterized by abundant early
	season precipitation and some cool temperatures followed by a summer
	of unusually high temperatures and prolonged and severe drought.
	While the 2002 soil and water temperature data generally  lie above
	those of 2001, and the forms of the distributions  broadly similar,
	there are important differences in detail which, by comparison of
	the two years, allow, at least tentatively, identification of the
	mechanisms that are operative in these perturbations.	<p>
		A characteristic
	common to both the 2001 and 2002 data is the small variation in soil
	temperature between stations. This is particularly true of the
	Ramsey's Draft data which, in 2002, except for one date, show a
	spread of  only 1.5 deg C over a distance of nearly a mile ( 1.6 km
	) and the time span of the several hours it took to conduct the
	survey. There is also no systematic difference between individual or
	even widely separated stations. Even in the Mesic Slope Forest, in
	which the stations extend through different elevations and aspects,
	the soil temperature spread, with the exception of a single date,
	are equal or less than 2.0 deg C. However, in this case the two
	ridge top stations with essentially flat aspects, registered
	systematically higher temperatures than the others ( with northerly
	aspects ). This uniformity of recorded soil temperatures in a given
	forest type lends credence  to the idea that a fundamental component
	of the ecosystem is being measured. The importance of soil
	temperatures is supported by the data of Hadley and Foster ( undated
	) who stated that &quot;Soil temperature is the most important
	single environmental variable affecting hemlock forest carbon
	balance during the warm half of the year.&quot; There is no reason
	to believe that it is less important in mixed or deciduous forests. 
	<p>	For a
	description of the instrument and methods employed in the
	temperature measurements, as well as their precision, the reader is
	referred to the previous report ( Mueller, 2002 ).As in our
	treatment of the 2001 data. it should always be kept in mind that,
	while some  temperature distributions, including part of the
	Ramsey's Draft soil temperature trend, appear to define a smooth
	curve, other distributions indicate that this may be a fortuitous
	consequence of the large time intervals between measurements.
	However, from the perspective of two season's data, it appears
	likely that the water temperatures of the Deep - source Spring do
	define a smooth curve as a consequence of the greater continuity
	inherent in the subsurface hydrology.<p>

<p>
	<p>	Descriptions
	of the Ramsey's Draft area as well as the Oak - Hickory Ridge and
	Mesic Slope Forests were provided in the previous report ( Mueller,
	2002 ). However that report had a serious omission, namely that the
	Canada Hemlock ( <I>Tsuga  canadensis</I> ), which forms an
	important component of the canopy in parts of the study area at
	Ramsey's Draft, has been seriously impacted by the Hemlock Wooly
	Adelgid ( <I>Adelges  tsugae</I> ), with substantial loss of canopy
	density. Since it is likely that the thermal regime of the Valley is
	largely imposed by subsiding cool air from nearby highlands, it is
	not clear what impact the loss of Hemlock would have. However,
	although the Valley climate may in part have and external source,
	the retention of the cool air is likely to be influenced by the
	Hemlock.<p>

	median values of the soil temperature, soil temperature spreads and
	single value water temperatures for the stream and two springs, in
	particular the Deep - source Spring.

	<p>Table 1 Median
	temperatures and temperature spreads for seven soil temperature
	stations and single value water temperatures representing the Stream
	and two springs, including in particular the Deep - source Spring,
	all at Ramsey's Draft. The &quot;adj. spring&quot; refers to a
	spring adjacent to the Deep - source Spring. For the dates 7 - 2 -
	02 and 9 - 25 - 02 only five soil temperature stations  are
	represented.<p>
	</font>
	
	</center>
 
	<p>	It should be
	noted that the Deep - source Spring ceased flowing some time after 9
	- 6 - 02, the date of the last recorded temperature. However, an
	adjacent spring, which registered a temperature 0.5 deg C higher
	than the Deep - source Spring on that date, was still flowing on 9 -
	19 - 02. Given the higher temperature value of this spring, it is
	likely that it had a shallower source, although probably not
	connected to subsurface stream flow.<p>
		The median soil
	and Deep - source Spring temperatures  of Table 1 have been plotted
	in Figure 1. While both distributions show regularity, there is a
	marked dip in the soil temperature  during May, as well as a curious
	short - lived rise in September. The May dip in temperature is most
	easily explained as a result of a cool rainy period ( writer's
	weather notes ) and is consistent with the data of Davidson et al (
	1998 ). The September rise is of greater interest and best left for
	later comparison with the other forest types. However, very
	pertinent here is the observation of an associated slight increase
	in soil moisture as observed during  the temperature measurements.
	Similarly, the detailed characteristics of the Deep - source Spring
	distribution are best left for comparison with those of 2001.<p>
		As in 2001, stream
	temperatures match the soil temperatures rather closely, with those
	for six out of eleven dates differing only 0.5 deg C from the median
	soil temperatures, and only three by as much as 1.5 deg C.<p>

	the 2001 data, the Oak - Hickory Ridge Forest distribution is
	characterized by rather abrupt changes and lies well above that of
	Ramsey's Draft. Note also that the small September temperature rise
	present at the latter location, occurs here as well.<p>

	One of these fluctuations, the sharp temperature drop in May,
	appears to coincide with that in the Ramsey's Draft data when the

	single value measurements. As in the other figures, the Ramsey's
	Draft soil temperature trend is shown for comparison. As in the case
	of the 2001 data, the values obtained are consistent with the forest
	types and the environments represented. The North River soil and
	water temperatures fall above the Ramsey's Draft trend but a little
	below that of the Mesic Slope Forest ( Figure 3 ).The data from Bear
	Mountain ( see our section on this area ) are represented by a 1330
	meter elevation ridge crest value, a 1250 meter south slope value
	and a 1180 meter value from the Spruce forest on a valley flat. That
	the soil and water temperature values all fall close to but a little
	below the Ramsey's Draft trend is consistent with the elevations and

	<p>	The single
	soil temperature from Blowing Springs is somewhat atypical  for the
	area, but is consistent with the northern aspect from which it was
	obtained. This aspect at an elevation of only 515 meters asl is
	marginally tolerated by a few boreal species found there. These
	include Millet Grass ( <I>Milium  effusum</I> ) and a single
	occurrence of Canada Mayflower ( <I>Maianthemum  canadense</I> ).
	Consequently the position of the temperature value a little below
	and near the Ramsey's Draft trend is not beyond the realm of
	expectation.<p>
		The impressively
	low value of the Dolly Sods soil temperature is consistent with what
	is known of the site ( see our section on the area ). Although not
	very high at 1180 meters asl, it falls at the edge of a large
	plateau that has a configuration especially suited to cold air
	accumulation, and additionally falls in the area of the Allegheny
	cloudy - day maximum ( Reifsnyder and Lull, 1965 ). Reflecting these
	conditions is the occurrence here of as many high elevation and
	boreal species as at any location in the Central Appalachians.<p>

<H2>Comparison
of the 2002 and 2001 Data and Summary</H2>
<ul>
<p>
 
	<p>	It is
	informative to compare the 2002 data on soil and water temperature
	distributions with those of 2001.Figures 5 and 6 compare the median
	soil temperatures and single value Deep - source Spring temperatures
	for Ramsey's Draft, while Figures 7 and 8 compare the distributions
	for the Oak - Hickory Ridge and Mesic Slope Forests. These figures
	at once illustrate the fundamental similarity of the 2002 and 2001
	distributions for each forest type, and the effects of variations in
	air temperatures and precipitation. We have already mentioned the
	role of early season precipitation in the formation of the observed
	spikes of low soil temperatures at Ramsey's Draft and in the Mesic
	Slope Forest. In the case of the latter we can see in Figure 8 an
	incipient early April correspondence of rapidly increasing
	temperatures in the leafless forest for the two years. In 2002 this
	was soon undone by heavy rains that resulted in the first downward
	spike. However, as the forest in late April was still largely
	leafless, soil temperatures again began to climb toward the second
	maximum. Once full leafing out occurred in early May of 2002, and as
	the rains continued, the second sharp downward spike, shared by
	Ramsey's Draft, occurred.<p>
		Although hinted at
	in Figure 7 for the Oak - Hickory Ridge Forest, the variations so
	clearly shown for the Mesic Slope Forest, are virtually absent in
	the data of the former. It is possible that this is a consequence of
	the moderating effect of the associated wetland cold trap ( Mueller,
	2002 ) or of the prevailing southerly slopes in the case of the Oak
	- Hickory Ridge Forest. In any case, the differences between the
	early season distributions for the two years in that forest fall
	within the uncertainty of the temperature measurements.<p>
		The observed
	cooling effect of high precipitation has important implications in
	floristics. Davidson <I>et al</I> ( 1998 ) have shown that the
	relations between such factors as soil moisture, temperature and
	rate of respiration are very complex, and that soil respiration at
	first rises with increasing moisture at low moisture contents, but
	declines, at least under high moisture conditions. We should also
	remember that respiration of organic matter in soil is exothermic,
	as is clearly shown by such human activities as composting, in which
	high temperatures may be reached. The cooling effect of high
	precipitation, as indicated in Figures 1,3 and 8, may be offset in
	part or entirely by the heat generated by respiration, but at high
	moisture content the cooling process may dominate. It may be that
	this interplay lies behind the occurrence of some boreal species
	south of their normal ranges and in southern forest types. An
	example is the frequent trace of Yellow Birch ( <I>Betula</I> 
	<I>alleghaniensis</I> ) found by Braun ( 1950 ) in the moist
	Cumberland Mountain mixed mesophyte forest, and the greater amount
	of this species in such forests that were rich in Hemlock.
	Similarly. Newell et al ( 1997 and 1998 ) found Yellow Birch to be a
	component of low elevation alluvial forests of the Joyce Kilmer -
	Slickrock and Linville Gorge Wilderness Areas of North Carolina.
	While a factor in the latter occurrences is the subsidence and
	accumulation of cool air from surrounding high mountains on flat
	bottomland, the relatively high precipitation of this Southern
	Appalachian region may also be involved. 
	<p>	We have
	already referred to the abrupt September rise in soil temperatures
	in the three intensively studied forest types. Although not easily
	subject to proof, we may speculate that this rise is attributable to
	the same factors discussed above and related to regional conditions.
	As this rise was preceded by a long period of severe drought in the
	entire region, we should expect in late summer a pent up store of
	dead soil organic matter that is the normal consequence of herb and
	woody plant senescence and dormancy. Ordinarily, in times of normal
	soil moisture, this material would have been consumed by soil
	respiration . As daylight hours shortened, we should expect first
	some cooling as displayed in the figures, and with this an increased
	soil moisture, as was also observed at this time. Under these
	circumstances we might expect a rapid transient rise in soil
	temperature as a consequence of increase exothermic respiration of
	the pent up organic matter.<p>
		The effect of the
	drought on springs, and most particularly on the Deep - source
	Spring was, we may infer, of an equally interesting nature, As shown
	in Figure 6 the 2002 distribution descends rapidly below that of
	2001 as the drought attains its greatest severity. This cooling
	effect of the drought on spring water may be understood if we
	consider that this water is likely composed of components with
	varying residence times at different depths and, that during a
	drought, the shallow, an hence warmer components, are less likely to
	be replenished. 
	<p>	It is also of
	interest to compare the Deep - source Spring temperatures with soil
	temperatures at a depth of 50 cm, as obtained by Crews and Wright (2000) in the Fernow Experimental Forest and vicinity in West
	Virginia's Allegheny Mountains. These authors attempted to determine
	the extent of the occurrence of &quot;frigid soils&quot;, or those
	soils with a mean annual temperature in the range of 1 to 7 deg C at
	a depth of 50 cm and with the difference between mean winter and
	summer temperatures in excess of 5 deg C. While only one soil was
	classified as frigid for two consecutive years, and that on a summit
	at 1174 meters asl, several other soils at lower elevations and
	other aspects yielded mean summer temperatures comparable to the
	Deep - source Spring data. For example, a 1996 mean summer
	temperature value of 14.3 deg C was obtained at a 50 cm depth at an
	elevation of 762 meters and an E/SE aspect on Fork Mountain. In the
	same year and on the same mountain and elevation but on a SW aspect,
	a value of 14.2 deg C was obtained for the mean summer temperature.
	If the mean Deep - source Spring water temperature is calculated for
	the 2001 June, July and August data points (Mueller, 2002), a
	value of 14.2 is obtained , which almost identical to the cited 50
	cm data. However, if the mean is determined for the comparable 2002
	data ( Table 1 ) the obtained value of 15.5 deg C clearly reflects
	the unusually high air temperatures of that year. These results are
	however in general agreement with the postulated deep source of this
	spring water.<p>
		Interesting, but
	somewhat unexpected, is the close correspondence of the median soil
	temperatures and the stream water temperatures at Ramsey's Draft,
	especially  inasmuch as the latter have their origins in part at
	higher elevations and in deeper source springs as well as near
	surface waters. While exposure to sunlight and air warming may be
	factors, these waters also flow out of sight beneath the stream's
	cobble bedload for substantial distances, especially during the very
	common summer dry periods.<p>
