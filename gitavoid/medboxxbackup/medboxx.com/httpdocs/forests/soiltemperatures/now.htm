<h2>Abstract</h2>
 <ul>
<P CLASS="western">	Soil and water temperatures were
determined for the third season  (2003)  at Ramsey's Draft, the
Shenandoah Valley Oak - Hickory Ridge and Mesic Slope Forests and
other locations in the Central Appalachians. The results are of
particular interest due to an unprecedented rainy season in which the
mean yearly precipitation was virtually doubled in many areas.</P>
<P>While the
soil and water temperatures at Ramsey's Draft adhere closely to those
of the more &quot;average&quot; year of 2001, early growing season
soil temperatures of the Oak-Hickory Ridge and Mesic Slope Forests
lie substantially below those of 2001. This is especially true of the
Mesic Slope Forest, which is dominated by northerly aspects and has
soils rich in clay and organic matter, in contrast to the sandy soils
at Ramsey's Draft. It is concluded that although the Ramsey's Draft
soils by and large have greater access to moisture than those of the
Slope soils, as a consequence of their proximity to the Stream /
spring related water table, their sandy nature allows more rapid
drainage of excess water to occur. Based on these data, as well as
those from other Appalachian forests, it is concluded that the
quantity of precipitation, particularly in the growing season, may
have an important effect in certain forests by lowering soil
temperatures.</P>


 </ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
 <ul>
<P>	Our data from <a href=soil_2001.htm>2001</a> and <a href=soil_2002.htm>2002</a> (Mueller,
2002, 2003) are consistent with a strong relation between certain
forest types and soil temperatures. Also of interest is the response
of soil and water temperatures to varying seasonal air temperatures
and soil moisture conditions throughout the 2001 and 2002 growing
seasons. Particularly marked was the response of the 2002 data to
unusually high air temperatures and the severe drought conditions in
that season.</P>
<P>	For descriptions of methods, terrain,
floras and forest types the reader is referred to the previous work (
Mueller, 2002). </P>
<P>	Conditions in 2003 were unprecedented
in the region, particularly with respect to the amount of rain, which
was virtually double the yearly average in many parts of the Central
Appalachians. Moreover, substantially lower than average air
temperatures also accompanied this precipitation. However we shall
see that there apparently is no simple relation between air and soil
temperatures, with the relation being also dependent on soil
character.</P>
<P>	While the data for 2003 are not as
extensive as those of the previous years-partly as a consequence of
weather conditions-they do span the most critical part of the
growing season.</P>


 </ul>
<h2>Ramsey's Draft</h2>
 <ul>

<P>The 2003
soil and water temperature data from Ramsey's Draft are shown in
Table 1, and the composite data for 2001  (Mueller,2002)  and 2003
have been plotted in Figure 1.</P>
<P>	It should be mentioned that the last
three surveys  (6-10-03, 7-17-03, 8-23-03)  are from only
the first five soil temperature stations. Notable also is the
similarity in the temperature spreads to those of the two previous
years. 
</P>
<P>	Figure 1 shows that despite the
universally wet conditions in 2003, both the soil and Deep-source
Spring water temperatures are very similar to those of the more
&quot;normal&quot; year 2001, and in the case of the Deep-source
Spring the data points essentially fall on the same smooth curve,
given an uncertainty in precision of  + or- 0.5 deg C. 
Additionally, the last 2003 Spring data point  (for 8-23-03) 
falls late enough in the season to show the difference in character
of this curve from that of the drought period of 2002., which plunges
to lower values this late in the season as a result of the truncation
of the shallow water component of the Spring  (Mueller, 2003).  While
the 2003 soil temperature data points do not all fall on lines
joining the 2001 data points, they come close, except for the last (
8-23-03 } point, which seems a little high, but may still
approximate a hypothetical 2001 value, given the absence of data for
the latter year here.</P>

<h2>Oak-Hickory Ridge Forest</h2>

<P>	The 2003 soil temperature data for the
Oak-Hickory Ridge Forest are shown in Table 2. These data have been
plotted in Figure 2 with the more &quot;normal&quot; 2001 trend shown
for comparison. It is clear from these data that the 2003 soil
temperatures fall below those of 2001, with the largest difference at
the start of the record in April. Because of the paucity of data,
little can be said about the period after June, except that the
single July point seems to indicate convergence with both the 2001
and 2002  (Mueller, 2003)  data in mid summer.</P>

<h2>Mesic Slope Forest</h2>
 <ul> 
 
 The 2003 soil temperature data
for the Mesic Slope Forest are shown in Table 3 and these have been
plotted in Figure 3, with the 2001 trend shown for comparison. It
should be noted that four surveys, as indicated in the Table caption,
are based on only the first five stations with a northerly aspect,
and omit the two ridge crest stations, which have nearly flat aspects
and generally register the highest temperatures. 
</P>
<P>It is clear
by comparison with Figure 2 that the soil temperatures for this
forest show a greater difference from the 2001 trend than those of
the Oak-Hickory Ridge Forest. Also of interest is the apparent
replication of the early May maximum that appears in both 2001 and
2002 and which presumably marks the end of the bare-branch period
of rapid warming.</P>

<h2>Additional Soil Temperatures from the Mountains</H2>
<ul>


	Additional single-value soil
temperatures for four locations in the Virginia and West Virginia
mountains are shown in Table 4. These values have been plotted in
Figure 4 with the composite 2001-2003 soil temperature trend for
Ramsey's Draft. The reader is referred to our descriptive sections on
the Virginians for Wilderness Web Site for these locations.</P>
<P>	Chimney Hollow is actually represented
by two identical values that were obtained at slightly different
locations. Also, since this hollow is located near  Ramsey's Draft,
and like the latter, is subject to cool subsiding air, the similarity
in values is not unexpected. While the two areas differ in elevation,
the fact that Ramsey's Draft opens to the southwest and Chimney
Hollow to the northwest, probably tends to compensate for the lower
elevation of the latter.</P>
<P>	The values of the July-early August
data points for the East Fork of the Greenbrier and Fanny Bennett
seem a little high given the distinct boreal character of much of
their floras. However, the late August values for the East Fork of
the Greenbrier and Locust Spring / Laurel Fork  (Virginia)  are more
in line with what is expected. The datum from Locust Spring / Laurel
Fork is in fact from Red Spruce Forest, a habitat known for its
frigid soils  (Fleming and Moorhead, 1996). </P>

<H2>Conclusions</H2>
 <ul>
 
 
<P>	Of considerable interest is the
difference in response of the soil temperatures at Ramsey's Draft
from those of the Shenandoah Valley Oak-Hickory Ridge and Mesic
Slope Forests. It seems likely that this difference is due largely to
differences in soil character. The soils at Ramsey's Draft are
dominantly sandy, occupy interstices between coarse alluvial cobble
and are not particularly rich in organic matter. By contrast the
Shenandoah Valley forest soils, being derived from limestone, are far
less stony and tend to be rich in clay and organic matter, This is
particularly true of the Mesic Slope Forest, which, in addition, is
dominated by northerly aspects. The Ramsey's Draft soils are
dominantly low-lying and not far above the steam and spring-
governed water table, which confers a constant supply of moisture not
available to upland soils. And this characteristic is compatible with
the common occurrence of such moisture-demanding species as Wood
Nettle  (<I>Laportea  canadensis</I>),  Blue Cohosh  (<I>Caulophyllum
 thalictroides</I>)  and Horse Balm  (<I>Collinsonia  canadensis</I>), of which only the latter is found in even the moistest parts of
the Mesic Slope Forest. However, the sandy and stony character of the
Ramsey's Draft soils also enables excess water to drain away rapidly,
in contrast with the Valley soils, in which the abundant clay and
organic matter acts to retain excess moisture. As a consequence we
should not be surprised that abundant precipitation results in a
marked temperature lowering in the Valley soils but has little or no
effect in those of Ramsey's Draft.</P>
<P>The
similarity of the 2001 and 2003 Deep-source Spring data, that
enables their trend to be approximated by the same smooth curve, is
more difficult to explain. However it may be that in more &quot;normal&quot;
years such as 2001, as well as in years of abundant moisture such as
2003, the Spring flow is considerably influenced by a relatively
shallow component which is diminished only in severe drought years
such as 2002.</P>
<P>As indicated
previously  (Mueller,2003),  a high yearly precipitation may have a
profound effect on the flora. This is indicated by the occurrence of
such boreal species as yellow Birch  (<I>Betula  alleghaniensis</I>) 
in mixed mesophyte forests in the Cumberland Mountains  (Braun, 1950) and other locations of the Southern Appalachians  (Newell et al,
1997 and Newell and Peet, 1998)   at moderate elevations. In the case
of the virgin old growth forests described by Braun, this effect may
have also been enhanced by the tall canopies which provided an
additional cooling effect of shade cast through a greater vertical
distance. Also, a number of occurrences described by Newell et al and
Newell and Peet fall on valley flats where they may have been
influenced by subsiding cool air. It would be of further interest to
determine if the low 2003 soil temperatures in the Mesic Slope Forest
occasion the appearance of additional cool-climate species in that
forest.</P>
