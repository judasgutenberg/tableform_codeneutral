<b>Abstract</b>
	<blockquote>
	
	A perspective of terrestrial ecosystems is developed in which plants are
regarded as occupying stability fields in volumes of multidimensional space
formed by physical variables such as temperature and chemical composition of
the substrate in addition to the familiar space axes.  Examples of observed
stability fields of some forest trees are given as are others involving
herbaceous species.  Inclusion of climatic, topographic and biologic factors
are discussed, and the importance of microhabitats is stressed.  Applications
to forest ecology and floral diversity and type in old growth forests is made
based on new data.  This perspective has the advantage of providing a unified
approach to a variety of data.  Because it incorporates the methods and subject
matter of mineral and physical chemistry it promises to broaden the scientific
basis of conservation biology and fortifies ecosystem protection as well.<p>

</blockquote>
<b>The Model</b><p>
<blockquote>
	How we see the forest, our mental perception, is important, not only in
recognizing threats to it, but also in providing tools to protect it.  The
world in which we live has a dimensionality that we move through in all we do.
To most of us this dimensionality is revealed in our spacial coordinates of
latitude, longitude and elevation or equivalents.  However, our perspective
increases greatly when we make the generalization from three dimensional space
to include axes such as time, temperature and a multitude of others that an
in-depth study of nature demands.  During my years of research in mineral
chemistry I was essentially exploring the multidimensional space of Earth's
crust along temperature, pressure and chemical composition axes.<a
href="#fn0"><sup><font size=-1>[1]</font></sup></a>  So it was inevitable that I have come to
recognize a similar, in some cases even the same, dimensionality in ecosystems.
However, there is a difference too.  While the determinants in mineral
chemistry are thermodynamic, a stable forest is not in thermodynamic
equilibrium and ecologic systems are so complex that they force us to fall back
on more general principles of dynamic change and stability.  However I firmly
believe that the approach that has proved indispensable in the study of mineral
systems provides a template to treat ecosystems as well.  Furthermore, life
processes clearly merge with those of physical chemistry in these systems.<p>
	A useful adaptation from mineral systems to forest ecosystems is the stability
field concept, which comes ultimately from physical chemistry.  Quite generally
a system is stable when it returns to a pre-existing state after a
perturbation.  However there is also a more restricted form of stability,
namely <i>metastability</i>, in which a system is in a relatively stable but
not the most stable state.  In mineral systems this corresponds to a low but
not the lowest Gibbs free energy state.  Examples are supercooled raindrops and
the high magnesium shells secreted by certain marine animals. A
non-thermodynamic example (which may however embody thermodynamic elements)
from silviculture is a Red Spruce tree planted below its elevational or
latitudinal limit or a Black Walnut planted above.  In either case the tree may
thrive but will not reproduce.  Plants may also find themselves in metastable
situations as environmental conditions change.<p>

<p>
	A stability field is a volume of multidimensional space in which a species is
stable or in some cases metastable.  Soil moisture and pH (acidity) are two of
the most useful axes in plotting the stability fields of many forest species.
This is a direct consequence of the almost universal importance of humidity and
acidity in biochemical processes (Edsall and Wyman, 1958).  Figure 1
illustrates the stability fields of some common and less common trees in terms
of these axes.  Although the soil moisture axis shows only relative field
boundaries along it, these are defined by recognizable dry and saturated
limits.  The figure shows how associations arise from overlapping fields and
one reason why some species are less common than others.  Although the figure
is based on extensive field data, it is still tentative and subject to
correction.  Because the figure is a two dimensional slice through
multidimensional space, it is subject to variations along other axes, such as
for example in the Calcium/Magnesium ratio.  It must be kept in mind that such
figures express necessary but not sufficient conditions for the presence of a
given species, which may depend on other factors such as available seed sources
or succession in which different species occupy the same or slightly different
stability fields at different times.  Another caveat is the possible alteration
of stability relations by the species themselves; which happens when Hemlock
acidifies the upper soil layers by needle drop.  In addition genetic variation
may expand a species' stability field.  Despite such complications --which I
have not exhausted above-- certain associations are clearly excluded.  The use
of compatible and incompatible species -- also a direct carryover from mineral
chemistry -- provides a readily available and practical means of rapid
assessment and characterization of forest tracts.  As illustrated in the
figure, which is only one of many possible, certain tree species do not
normally occur together since their stability fields do not overlap, and if
such incompatible species are found in close proximity, a steep gradient along
some axis is indicated, or alternatively, other axes may be involved.<p>
	After this paper was written Reed Noss drew my attention to a book by G. E.
Hutchinson ( 1965 ). In this interesting work the author proposed a model in
which a volume of multidimensional space ( "hyperspace" ) represents a
"fundamental niche" of a species. Although he did not explicitly treat forest
ecosystems and virtually confined his examples to animals, his model is clearly
congruent with that proposed here. Of particular interest is his treatment of
competition between similar species and which may be extended to forest plants
as well. Despite the importance of this concept of a niche, the alternative of
stability field is retained here since the latter is not limited to organisms
but also applies to the mineral substrates upon which organisms depend and thus
unifies more diverse phenomena.<p>
	Moisture, acidity, temperature and other axes also reveal themselves in
sequences of herbaceous and woody plants with different stabilities along these
axes.  In some cases "dropout sequences" occur in which a number of species
occur together at some temperature or pH, for example, but drop out in
succession as these parameters either increase or decrease.  Thus Teaberry
(<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>), Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera
pubescens</i>), Rattlesnake Weed (<i>Hieracium venosum</i>) and Spotted
Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila maculata</i>) may occur together at high acidity
(pH=3 to 4) ranges but drop out in the approximate order they are written in
above as acidity decreases.  Preliminary observations suggest a number of such
sequences and one involving temperature was previously presented (Mueller,
1996).  An analogous system was introduced by K&uuml;chler (1972) in his
analysis of "phytocenoses" or natural plant communities.  In this system
overlapping species ranges were used to fix such parameters as pH for the
community.<p>
	Despite differences, there is a close link between the inorganic mineral world
and ecosystems, a link far closer than recognized in much current research.
Thus many articles on natural biologic systems and forests in particular fail
to specify the nature of the mineral substrate.  While most rocks and their
contained minerals were formed or modified deep within Earth's crust, their
exposure on the surfaces drives them toward an equilibrium suitable to those
conditions.  And it is this trend toward equilibrium -- in this case
thermodynamic -- that creates, with the participation of climate and organisms,
the substrate for terrestrial organisms and by extension aquatic ones as well.
Thus it is hardly surprising that plants have evolved specific relations with
various substrates and that these relations extend to the bedrock and derived
materials.  Carbonates (limestone, dolomite, and some other sedimentary  rocks)
as well as basic igneous and metamorphic rocks create circumneutral and
alkaline environments while siliceous sandstones, cherts and granites create
acid ones.  Additionally, shales are water-retaining while sandstones and
limestones allow it to drain away.  These factors combined with dynamic
colluvial movements, rainwater leaching and capillary action interact
powerfully with climate and topography, particularly in mountainous terrain, to
induce habitat diversity on the most fundamental level.  It is this complex of
physical conditions, combined with biological factors, that govern the
stability relations of the flora -- and in the end the fauna too.  At times the
relations are subtle and unexpected as I discovered while investigating the
flora associated with a silica sandstone with a carbonate cement.  In this case
reaction with acid rainwater had formed a crust of secondary minerals which
effectively sequestered the carbonate in the rock interior, allowing
acidiphilic plants to grow on its surface.  Thus an essentially thermodynamic
process had moved the system along the pH axis to a microhabitat that may at
first have seemed anomalous.  In other cases another axis, that of transport
and deposition, must be considered.  The influence of this axis on the
character of some tracts of old growth forest will be discussed in what
follows.<p>

<b>General Forest Ecology and Old Growth Applications</b><p>
<blockquote>
	It should be understood that much current research on forests is designed more
to further their exploitation rather than ecological understanding or
conservation.  An example is the use of uniform study plots along line
transects.  This is of course an established method in many biological field
investigations and has yielded much data of great ecological significance.  As
used in forestry however transects are frequently designed to avoid unusual
topography and other features, pay little heed to non-timber species such as
herbs and make few correlations between species and the mineral substrate.
Data obtained are frequently averaged (a very un-ecological process!) and fed
into statistics mills so microhabitats are obscured or ignored.  Such data may
be misleading because the uniformly-spaced plots or collection points may miss
significant cryptic ecotones marked by species not recorded, not spatially
located or which are averaged out of sight.  By contrast, stability field
analysis tells us that the precise location and relation to substrate and
topography of each plant, whether woody or herbaceous, may be significant to
the interpretation.  Special and unusual topographic and substrate features are
sought out to present the widest possible spectrum of habitats for comparison.
In this way the roles of these features and associated species in the regional
ecologic mosaic are revealed with the greatest economy.  In many areas,
including the Central Appalachians, these guidelines have generally not been
followed and research has tended to concentrate on a few forest types of the
many available, while detailed studies have tended to be confined to rare and
unusual communities.<p>
	Although the subject of old growth/primary forest has justifiably attracted
attention of late, there appears to be considerable uncertainty and confusion
regarding the origin of floral diversity in these forests.  At a recent
conference on old growth in eastern forests, emphasis was on developmental
history and disturbance regimes.  Although there were some attempts to evaluate
the forest as a whole, trees were the focus of attention, while herbs and
relation to the mineral substrate received little.  Thus Williams (1997) called
upon "site specific and regional historical and ecological factors" in an
attempt to interpret herb layer species composition and richness in the old
growth forest he studied, but did not specify what these factors were.  It is
contended here that attention to fundamental stability relations involving the
mineral substrate and topography in such forests can contribute greatly to
explaining variations in floral diversity and type.<p>
	In our inventory program Virginians for Wilderness have attempted to correlate
the character of the herb layer, including bryophytes, with the mineral
substrate and topographic factors in old growth/primary forest tracts in the
Central Appalachians.  Examples presented here include three tracts dominated
by Eastern Hemlock (<i>Tsuga candensis</i>) and one of the mixed forests with
Red Spruce (<i>Picea rubens</i>).  The tracts with Hemlock include Dolly Ann
Hollow in the George Washington National Forest and War Spur Hollow in the
Mountain Lake Wilderness of the Jefferson National Forest, both in Virginia,
and the Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove of the Monongahela National Forest in West
Virginia.  The mixed forest with spruce is in the Gaudineer Scenic Area, also
in the Monongahela.<p>
	All three of the Hemlock tracts also contain codominant Appalachian or
Northern Hardwoods and the last two have Red Spruce as well, although the
spruce in Fanny Bennett is largely in the understory.  Trees in all three
Hemlock tracts are large and vigorous but the character and richness of the
shrub and herb layers vary considerably among them.  Soils at Dolly Ann and War
Spur are prevailingly acid and those of War Spur fall in the range of 2.9-4.4
(Adams and Stephensen, 1991).  They are developed on Silurian
Sandstone-dominated watersheds (Rader and Evans, 1993;  Rader and Gathright,
1986).  The situation at Fanny Bennett is more complex.  While it is also
underlain by sandstone, in this case Mississippian Pocono Formation, the same
watershed up-slope from the Hemlock grove contains Greenbrier Limestone, also
of Mississippian age (Cardwell<i>et al</i>, 1986).  This limestone is in
contact in varying degrees with two streams, the mainstream Sawmill Branch and
a smaller branch of the latter.  Both flow through Fanny Bennett.<p>
	Both Dolly Ann and War Spur have floras with acid soil affinities but the
species differ somewhat because of elevational differences.  Great Rhododendron
(<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>), Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>) and
Blueberries (<i>Vaccinium</i>  spp.) occur quite generally. Ground floras are
sparse, lack diversity and are virtually confined to acid-demanding or tolerant
plants such as Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>), Canada Mayflower
(<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>) and Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris
intermedia</i>). In contrast the character of shrub and herb floras of Fanny
Bennett vary greatly in response to topographic position.  Those under Hemlock
on a southwest-facing slope are sparse and are comprised of acid-soil species
including Painted Trillium (<i>Trillium undulatum</i>), <i>Leucobryum</i>
cushion moss and liverwort <i>Bazzania trilobata</i>.  These Hemlock stands
grade upward into ericaceous oak-pine forest on a spur top.  Soils on the the
entire slope are derived from the Pocono sandstone.<p>
	The shrub and ground floras of the bottom-land streamside Hemlock forest are
far more diverse and dense than those of either the adjacent slope forest or
the streamside forests of Dolly Ann and War Spur.  The difference is clearly a
consequence of the access that the Fanny Bennett bottomland forests have to the
Greenbrier limestone.  Furthermore, even the degree of this access is reflected
in the floras.  In the bottomland along the small branch stream, which has the
least access to the limestone, there is a rather rich flora with numerous
acid-soil herbs such as Partridge Berry and Canada Mayflower as well as diverse
bryophytes, including Plume Moss (<i>Ptilium crista-castrensis</i>), Mountain
Fern Moss (<i>Hylocomium splendens</i>) and <i>Bazzania</i>.  However these are
joined by circumneutral-favoring species such as Wake Robin (<i>Trillium
erectum</i>) and Wild Stonecrop (<i>Sedum ternatum</i>).  In the mainstem
bottom, herb diversity, density and luxuriance are substantially greater than
along the branch stream and both woody and herbaceous plants are more
indicative of neutral and even alkaline soils.  These include, among many
others, Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens</i>) of both species, Maidenhair Fern
(<i>Adiantum pedatum</i>), Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>), Slippery
Elm (<i>Ulmus rubra</i>) and most indicative of all, the strongly calciphile
Bulbiferous Bladder Fern (<i>Cystopteris bulbifera</i>).<p>
	In this example the relation between the flora and the mineral substrate is
expanded to include the transport/deposition dimension, thus illustrating the
dependence on the character of the enveloping topography as well.  While in
this case composition is to a large degree governed by alluvial processes, in
other cases topographically-determined air drainage and accumulation may
explain the presence of species from a different climatic zone.  In the Central
Appalachians this expressed as a mirroring effect, in which cold climate
species such as Mountain Ash (<i>Pyrus americana</i>), Yellow Birch (<i>Betula
allegheniensis</i>) and Canada Mayflower occur at both the highest elevations
and in adjacent low valley flats but not on slopes in between.<p>
	The Gaudineer Scenic Area of old growth forest differs considerably from the
three Hemlock-bearing tracts.  Conifers, in this case Red Spruce, comprise less
than 50% and dominance is shared by Yellow Birch, Red Maple (<i>Acer
rubrum</i>), American Beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>) with minor White Ash
(<i>Fraxinus americana</i>) and Black Cherry (<i>Prunus serotina</i>).
Topographically this forest occupies an upper slope with an easterly aspect and
at 3900 ft (1200 meters) asl, is the highest of the four tracts discussed here.
Bedrock, where observed by the writer, consists of very light gray
conglomeratic sandstone of Carboniferous age, which decomposes to form a
pebble-rich white sand.  Because Spruce forms less than 50% of the tract, no
continuous bryophyte/mor layer, such as characterizes pure spruce, has
developed.  Rather, in response to the rapid decay of Birch and Maple leaves,
the organic soil layer is thin and discontinuous.  According to Adams and
Stephensen (1989) soil pH is in the range of 3.5.  Although the red Spruce
appears to show good reproduction in openings, the low rate of growth of both
old and young spruce as measured by Adams and Stephensen supports their
contention that this species appears to be in decline here, at least for now.<p>
	Although herb diversity at Gaudineer is considerably greater than at Dolly
Ann, War Spur and the Fanny Bennett slope forest, this is probably a
consequence of the dominantly deciduous canopy and the abundant springs around
which many herbs are concentrated.  The herb layer is dominated by acid-soil
species such as White Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis montana</i>) and Intermediate
Shield Fern. Where characteristic rich-soil species such as Wood Nettle do
occur, they are stunted and unhealthy looking  Thus the floral content and
diversity of this tract of old growth also fits the pattern of substrate
assertion and is appropriate to forest type and the climatic zone.<p>
	Stability field relations also bear directly on the frequently raised question
regarding the existence of species particularly characteristic of, or which are
confined to, old growth forest.  Thus Martin (1992) suggested that Fraser's
Sedge (<i>Cymophyllus fraseri</i>) might be an indicator of old growth
conditions.  However in every place I have observed this species it occupied
second growth, albeit in rich soil.  In one case the enveloping vegetation
consisted of a young, acidic Spruce-Fir northern hardwood mixed forest while
Fraser Sedge flourished in a narrow alluvial zone.  Such occurrences illustrate
the primacy of substrate and microhabitats established by whatever means over
simple passage of time.<p>

<b>Conclusions</b><p>
<blockquote>
	Nature's multidimensional space affords us a perspective which leads naturally
to the stability field concept.  Combined with classical ecological principles
this concept offers a more comprehensive approach than has generally been
applied to terrestrial ecosystems and forests in particular.  Its principles
elucidate such studies as those involving nutrient cycles, succession and the
distribution of plants on both macro and micro scales because they are
concerned with the most fundamental relation of plants to substrate.  In her
brilliant classic <i>Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America</i>, (1950), E.
Lucy Braun sought to distinguish climatic, topographic and edaphic (soil)
climaxes, believing that the first named would eventually prevail if enough
time were available, and even today some forest ecologists still distinguish
between the three.  While there is little question that climate plays an
important role in determining variations in forest type, particularly on a
regional scale, bedrock and bedrock-derived materials have a dominant influence
on smaller scales (Mueller &amp; Mueller, 1997).  Indeed, Braun's classic is
rife with her discernment of this influence on a regional scale as well,
particularly in her Western Mesophytic Forest Region.  Examination of many
forest types and stages of development in the Central Appalachians has led me
to the conclusion that all stages of development from the earliest to climax
result from the interplay of biologic, climatic and geologic factors and that
all three factors are usually apparent in the vegetation and expressed in
stability relations.<p>
	Stability field analysis of natural ecosystems and forests in particular also
broadens the scientific basis of conservation biology through its incorporation
of mineral and physical chemistry as well as analyses of climatic phenomena.
In so doing we in a sense play catch-up to economic geology, which for years
has been using plants as indicators of mineral deposits.  We can do no less
than exploit these and other tools available to protect our fast-dwindling
ecosystems.<p>
