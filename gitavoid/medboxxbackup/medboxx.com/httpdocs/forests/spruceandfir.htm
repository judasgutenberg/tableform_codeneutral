<h2>High Elevation Spruce and Fir Forests of
Sugar Creek, Yew and Black Mountains</h2>


<p><b>Pocahontas County, West Virginia</b>

<br><b>November, 1999</b>
<blockquote>
<p><b>General</b>
<ul>
<p> 
<p> Between Tea Creek and the Cranberry glades the
Allegheny Plateau is so deeply dissected that what remains at high elevations
is a pattern of flat-topped dendritic ridges. These ridges are largely formed
of resistant sandstone of the Pennsylvania Kanawha Formation. The tops and
upper slopes of these ridges, among which are Sugar Creek, Yew and Black
Mountains, are, or once were, occupied by Red Spruce montane forest of boreal
aspect. In one place there is a fir
forest that, although in part a result of a plantation,also propagated itself
naturally.
<p> The Sugar Creek, Yew and Black Mountains are some of
the loftiest parts of the Plateau, but are (unfortunately) easily accessible
by State Route 150 which runs through the area from north to south. This road
also skirts the eastern edge of one of the largest federally designated
wildernesses in the East, the Cranberry Wilderness Of the Monongahela National
Forest and is near the famous Cranberry Glades Botanical Area (see <a href=cranberry.htm>our section
on the Cranberry Glades and Vicinity</a>). Much of the forest discussed here falls
in the Wilderness.

</ul>
<p><b>Transitional Forest</b>


<br><b>Source Walk: 8-5-95 warm, pleasant</b>
<ul>
<p> Two areas were inventoried near the junction of the
access trail from Route 150 and the North-South Trail just west of the 4215 ft
(1285 meter) elevation bench mark. 
These areas are on the south slope of Sugar Creek Mountain. The forest in these areas are transitional
from northern hardwood to spruce forest in space and probably also in
time. They are depauperate northern
hardwood but with a spruce element that points to eventual reversion to spruce
forest similar to that which predated logging in the region.
<p> The first site is on a flat south of the trail
junction at about 4250 ft (1295 meters) elevation. The forest here is young, perhaps not much more than 50 years in
age. The canopy consists of about 40%
Red Spruce, 30% Yellow Birch with the rest Red Maple and Beech. Understory is Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>) and Mountain Holly
(<i>Ilex montana</i>. ). Mountain Ash (<i>Pyrus americana</i>) occurs mostly as
seedlings. There is also some Mountain
Maple (<i>Acer spicatum</i>) and Southern Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium erythrocarpum</i>) . Ground cover is dominated by New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis</i>) . Other herbs are White Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis</i> <i>montana</i>) , Canada Mayflower (<i>
Maianthemum canadense</i>) , Partridge Berry 
(<i>Mitchella repens</i>) , Shining clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium lucidulum ),</i> Ground Pine (<i>L. flabelliforme )</i>,
Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>) ,
Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana
</i>) and the sedges <i>Carex intumescens</i> and <i>C.
radiata</i>. There are small patches of
Haircap (<i>Polytrichum</i> ) and<i> </i>Peat (<i>Sphagnum ) </i>Mosses, <i>Leucobryum</i> and <i>Dicranum
</i>cushion mosses on down tree
trunks. The leafy liverwort, <i>Bazzania rilobata</i>, occurs
on old stumps. In open seepy areas
there is manna grass (<i>Glyceria melicaria</i>),
Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus</i>) 
and the orchid, <i>Habenaria lacera</i> as,
as well as other herbs.
<p> The second site is about 600 ft (200 meters) north of
the first, along the North-South Trail on a southeast slope. Large beautiful Black Cherry, some of which
are more than 18 inches (46 cm) dbh dominate the site. Yellow Birch, Red Maple and Beech are also
common, and there is a little Sugar Maple. 
Red Spruce is a minor component, mostly in the understory with Striped
Maple and Mountain Holly . In one place
there is a small grove of equally small Cucumber Magnolia (<i>Magnolia acuminata</i>) ,
which, at an elevation of perhaps 4300 ft (1310 meters), is probably at its
elevational limit. The dominant ground
cover here is Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris
intermedia</i> ), with smaller amounts
of White Wood Sorrel, Canada Mayflower, Partridge Berry, Indian Cucumber-root,
Shining Clubmoss and <i>Carex debilis</i>. Hermit Thrushes (<i>Catharus
guttatus</i>) were heard to sing in this forest.
<p> The dominantly deciduous forest of this slope yields
gradually to spruce forest above 4400 ft (1340 meters). It is likely that slope and aspect play
almost as important a role here as elevation. 
The greater abundance of spruce on the flat probably reflects not only
cold air accumulation but also more acid and poorly drained soils, while the
better-drained and relatively warm soils of the slope encourage deciduous
species. However conditions on the
slope are also likely to be temporary. 
Black Cherry is very intolerant of shade, and although it may have
grasped a brief advantage over spruce following logging, it will probably be
replaced by the latter over time, albeit at a slower rate than the deciduous
species on the flat - and if climate change does not occur!

<p><b>Spruce Forest, North-South Trail</b>
<br><b>Sugar Creek Mountain</b>

<br><b>Source Walks: 9-8-94 and 8-4-95</b>
<ul>
<p> This is the forest, mostly above 4400 ft (1340
meters) elevation, that lies upslope from the transitional forest previously
described. It lies along the
North-South Trail on the way to the Big Beechy Trail.
<p> Weather conditions were quite different on the two
walks, it being dry and clear on 8-4-95 but raining lightly and moist on
9-8-94.
<p> The forest canopy here is almost pure Red Spruce and
the terrain rocky with outcrops and residual large blocks of sandstone, many
with flat tops. The forest is young for
the most part with few trees exceeding a foot (0.3 meter) in diameter. In the transition from northern hardwood
Black Cherry vanishes but Yellow Birch and Red Maple persist as minor
components of the canopy. As in the
transitional forest, Striped Maple, Mountain Holly and Mountain Ash form an
understory. However some Mountain Ash
are tall enough to reach into the canopy and on 9-8-94 these had abundant
berries. A feature of the Mountain
Holly is a tendency to retain its leaves, which remain a sickly green into
September. Perhaps significantly also,
no Black Birch were sighted in the area, although it is possible that this
species was missed or confused with the abundant Yellow Birch.
<p> Shrubs are neither abundant nor diverse in this
forest. The most abundant in terms of
biomass is Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) , which forms colonies both
among the large rocks and on flats. The
only other shrub of importance is Southern Mountain Cranberry, which is
scattered throughout, and which on both visits bore its characteristic isolated
and insipid red berries, even in quite deep shade. Only one plant of Hobblebush (<i>
Viburnum alnifolium</i>) was seen, but there are small patches of Mountain
Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>) in a few places and in openings, a little
Thornless Blackberry (<i>Rubus canadensis</i>) .
<p> Herbs are few but distinctive. Dominating all is an almost continuous
blanket of the bright green <i>Bazzania
trilobata</i> , which not only occupies the forest floor between the spruce,
but climbs up the lower trunks. In
places this blanket is interrupted by small patches of <i>Cladina </i> lichen and <i>Sphagnum</i>, <i>Polytrichum</i> and <i>Leucobryum</i>
mosses, while the abundant down trees are host to the interesting and beautiful
Mountain Fern Moss (<i>Hylocumium splendens</i>) 
as well as species of <i>Dicranum</i>. In one place on the 9-8-94 walk, a peculiar
“shedding plant” was encountered. This
plant, which turned hands and face green on contact, might be a moss, liverwort
or a lichen. Since it was raining and
turning dark, there was not time to study it closely. It is likely however that the shedding is a mechanism of
propagation.
<p> Emerging from the blanket of <i>Bazzania</i> and mosses are
White Wood Sorrel, Canada Mayflower, Partridge Berry, Yellow Clintonia (<i>Clintonia 
borealis</i>) , Painted Trillium (<i>
Trillium undulatum</i>) , Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa 
uniflora</i>) , the sedges <i>Carex debilis 
</i>and <i>C. radiata</i> , as well as scattered Moccasin
Flower (<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>) . Although not abundant, Lycopods are represented by Shining 
Clubmoss and Tree Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium 
obscurum )</i>. In some places
Spinulose Shield Fern ( mostly <i>Dryopteris intermedia</i> ? )dominates, and in more
open areas, Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstaedtia
punctilobula</i>) , while Cinnamon and Interrupted (<i> O.smunda claytoniana</i>) Ferns occur in isolated patches. Fungi included species of <i>Russula</i> 
and <i>Amanita flavoconia</i>. Where there are rocks these are covered by mosses and Rock Fern (
<i>Polypodium virginianum</i> ) or on
flat, elevated surfaces by Spinulose Shield Fern, the other herbs, and a
proliferation of spruce seedlings and small saplings. These small spruce thrive wherever light is adequate, on rocks,
and on broad flats between the larger spruce. 
A characteristic of a number of herbs, in particular Canada Mayflower,
Clintonia and Trillium, is a marked stunting compared to their mode of growth
in other forests. Another curiosity is
the absence of Yew (<i>Taxus canadensis</i>),
which is seen to grow on elevated rocks similar to those here at lower
elevations because it is secure from deer browsing. However no evidence of Yew was seen in this spruce forest
although it occurs in similar habitat with spruce in New England (Braun, 1950).
It is likely that this shrub demands more nutrients than are avaiable in soils developed on the Kanawha sandstones
however.
<p> The August
visit produced few observations of fauna in the spruce forest. While thrushes were seen and heard to call,
positive identification of species could not be made. Unlike our experience among the hardwoods of the transitional
forest, no songs of the Hermit Thrush were heard here. Instead the thrush observed, which were
probably Hermit, behaved in a furtive and hurried manner as they flew between
the dark trunks of the spruce. The only
other animal seen was a large Wood Frog (<i>Rana
sylvatica</i>) , which, as is frequent in Appalachian forests, was far from any
open water.
<p> The Red Spruce show evidence of being very
shallow-rooted and when suffering windthrow usually fall in small groups. However the interlocking of roots in these
dense stands probably provides some protection from this type of disturbance.
<p> Along the trail, perhaps a mile or less from the
trailhead, the spruce forest has been disturbed on a larger scale or has for
some reason failed to regenerate. The
result is a stand of northern hardwoods consisting almost entirely of Beech,
Yellow Birch, Red and Striped Maple, a few shrubs, and small Spruce. Very likely this hardwood community is at
the limit of its ecological if not elevational range on this ridge, and will
eventually be replaced by spruce.

<p><b>Spruce Forest, North-South Trail</b>

<br> 
<b> Black Mountain </b>

<br><b>Source Walk: 8-26-92</b>
<ul>
<p> The trailhead here is about 2 miles (3.2 km) south of
the previously discussed site along Rt. 150. 
Access is to both the North-South and North Fork trails west of the 4556
ft (1389 meter) Bench Mark. The forest
is very similar to that on Sugar Creek Mountain but is on more level and less
rocky terrain. It is of similar age
with an understory of Mountain Holly<i></i>and
Mountain Ash and abundant Spruce seedlings and saplings. Here too <i>Bazzania </i>is the dominant ground cover with lesser
amounts of mosses, and Southern Mountain Cranberry is common. There are patches of Great Rhododendron and
surprisingly, this shrub was still in bloom in late August, raising the
question whether the colonies at these high elevations might not have resulted
from seeds carried from lower elevations by the wind, birds or other
agencies. It seems unlikely that seeds
could be produced by such late flowering here.
<p> Species and mode of occurrence of flowering herbs,
ferns and lycopods are also similar to those at the previously discussed
site. One difference, perhaps an
artifact of limited observation, is the presence here of Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia pilosa</i>) in openings. Additional observations yielded evidence of
feeding by some animal on spruce cones and the presence, perhaps related to
this, of a large flock of Ruffed Grouse (<i>
Bonasa umbellus</i>) .

<p><b>Spruce -Fir at Little Spruce Overlook</b>

<br> 

<b>Source Walk: 8-5-95, Bright and Sunny with Temp. near
80°F</b>
<ul>
<p> At an elevation of 4520 ft. (1380 meters) Route 150
bisects a stand of Spruce-Fir forest. , Although we were not able to confirm
it, since no cones were accessible for our inspection, the species here is said
to be Fraser Fir (<i>Abies fraseri</i>) 
and the result of a plantation ( personal communication B. R. McDonald and
David Saville; also see Minckler, 1940 ). While the largest trees are likely
part of the plantation, the many smaller ones, ranging from seedlings to small
saplings, as well as their integration with other vegetation, clearly represent
natural reproduction.
<p> It is interesting to compare this community with two
“southernmost” stations of Balsam Fir (<i>Abies
balsamea</i>) . The best known is the
occurrence on Hawksbill Mtn. in Virginia’s Shenandoah National Park, at
approximately 38°33’ N. latitude. 
Somewhat less well known is that at Blister Run in the Monongahela
National Forest 30 miles (50 km) NE of here and at about 38°36’N (see <a href=blisterer.htm>our
section on Blister Run</a>). The three communities differ considerably. On Hawksbill and nearby Stonyman Mtn. Fir
occurs as understory in a forest of Northern Red, White and Chestnut Oaks while
the Blister Run occurrence as a
component of Spruce-Hemlock-Northern Hardwoods in a swampy riparian zone.
<p> The Little Spruce Overlook site is a severe one by
any standard. On the exposed Black
Mountain Summit, thin sandy soil is all but missing among blocks of coarse
white sandstone. Despite the exposed position,
however the trees show little or no wind deformation. Fir occurs on both sides of the road over an area of perhaps ten
acres (4 hectares). On the west side of the road there is a gentle slope to the
northwest while on the east side it is steep toward the east.
<p> In composition the forest at the summit is Spruce-Fir
mixed with depauperate Hemlock-Northern Hardwood, consisting, in addition to
Canada Hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>) of
stunted Yellow Birch, Red Maple, Striped Maple, Mountain Ash and Mountain
Holly. Among these, the taller spruce
and Fir are conspicuous. Also present
are yellowed and sickly-appearing Great Rhododendron, Minnie-bush, Southern
Mountain Cranberry and a few Thornless Blackberry . Fir as well as other species show the most vigorous growth
downslope on either side of the road but the Fir attains the greatest size — up
to ten inches (0.3 meters) dbh or more— on the northwest slope, which is
probably part of the original plantation .
<p> Herbs are sparse in this forest but include Canada
Mayflower, Mountain Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia
compressa</i>) , Hay-scented, Spinulose Shield and Cinnamon Ferns, Shining and
Tree Clubmosses<i>,</i> various mosses and <i>Cladina </i> lichens. Downslope herbs
as well as woody vegetation become more lush and the same species as at the
summit are present. There are however
some additions, particularly on the steep eastern slope where a few Beech
trees, Indian Cucumber-root and some stunted and battered looking Cucumber
Magnolias were noted. This occurrence
of the Magnolia at near 4300 ft (1310 meters), is likely at the extreme
elevation limit for the species at this latitude and degree of continentality.
<p> Despite the severe growing conditions and remoteness
from its usual range, Fir seems to thrive at this site. This is indicated by the abundance of
seedlings and saplings within the forest and especially along the road
right-of-way and the abundant cones observed on the taller trees. From the appearance of these cones it is
likely that the trees were ready to drop seeds at this time.
