Walks: 6-19-94 and 8-11-96</h2>
<ul>
<p>This low
prominence on the southwest end of Spruce Mountain has the
distinction, at 4861 feet (1482 meters) asl, of being the highest
point in West Virginia. Spruce Mountain is part of a syncline in
which the highest part is composed of erosion-resistant Pottsville
sandstone of Pennsylvanian age (Cardwell <i>et al</i>, 1968). This
is essentially the same rock that underlies much of the Plateau and
upland of Dolly Sods, Canaan Mountain and other elevated Allegheny
areas. Ranging 3000 ft (910 meters) above the North Fork of the
South Branch of the Potomac, the forests that clothe Spruce Mountain
vary from rich mesophytic at low elevations through Appalachian and
Northern Hardwoods at mid-elevations, to spruce montane or subalpine
at the highest elevations. After logging and catastrophic fires,
examples of the primary forest are confined to such remnants as the
Fanny Bennett Hemlock Grove (see <A href=fannier.htm>our section on this grove</a>). 
Unfortunately the secondary forest has also been degraded by roads
and clearcut logging. At present much of the summit of Spruce Knob
is covered by a spruce-heath type vegetation in which a variety of
ericads vie with thickets of stunted or shrubby and densely-foliated
Red Spruce (<i>Picea rubens</i>) with branches spreading over the
ground. Dispersed among these major vegetation types is a
considerable diversity of lichens, bryophytes and flowering plants,
many of which are boreal or high montane in distribution.</p>
<p>	Below the
summit zone there is a well-developed canopy in which Northern
Hardwoods are mixed with Red Spruce. Doubtless this sub-summit but
high elevation forest consisted predominantly of Red Spruce in its
primary state, and there is evidence that reversion is occurring at
present.</p>
<p>	Our first
report here is of brief observations made on 8-11-96 at the Spruce
Knob Lake campground, which lies at about 4000 ft (1220 meters)
elevation. Although no detailed inventory was done, the following
features were noted: The canopy here consists of <i>young to mature
 (perhaps 50 years in age) American Beech (Fagus grandifolia), Red
and Sugar Maples (Acer rubrum</i> and <i>A. saccharum</i>) and
Black Cherry (<i>Prunus serotina</i>), with Striped Maple (<i>Acer
 pensylvanicum</i>) in the understory and Thornless Blackberry (<i>Rubus
canadensis</i>) at the forest edge. The only herbs seen in the time
available were Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii</i>), 
Mountain Bindweed (<i>Polygonum cilinode</i>), Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennst&aelig;dtia punctilobula</i>), Intermediate Shield Fern
 (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>), Calico Aster (<i>Aster
lateriflorus</i>), White Avens (<i>Geum canadense</i>), the
haircap moss <i>Polytrichum juniperium</i> and other mosses. A 16
inch (41 cm) dbh Red Maple contained a conspicuous tree moss that
formed little mounds (cushions) perhaps 2-3 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm
high (in a horizontal direction) and oval in form. From the
vase-like capsule form this may have been a species of the genus
<i>Orthotrichum</i>.</p>
<p>	A more
detailed inventory was done of the forest interior on the southeast
slope of Spruce Knob at near the 4500 ft (1370 meter) level. The
location of this site is just upslope from Forest Road 112, less than
a mile northeast of the road fork and the 4532 (1381 meter)
benchmark. The canopy here is young, perhaps less than 50 years in
age. Trees in approximate order of abundance were Yellow Birch,
Beech, Sugar Maple, Red Spruce, Black Cherry, Northern Red Oak (<i>Qercus rubra</i>) and White Ash (<i>Fraxinus</i> <i>americana</i>), with an understory of Striped Maple, hawthorn, including Dotted
Thorn (<i>Crat&aelig;gus punctata </i>) and Alternate-leaved
Dogwood (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i>). The herb-layer was dominated
by Mountain Aster (<i>Aster acuminatus</i>) with abundant New York
Fern (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis </i>) and the deciduous
spinulose shield fern <i>Dryopteris carthusiana</i>. There iwas
also some <i>.</i>Intermedia Shield Fern and the Mountain Wood Fern
<i>D. campyloptera</i>, a species usually confined to high elevations
and frost pockets. Cut-leaf Grapefern (<i>Botrychium dissectum</i>),
Rattlesnake Fern (<i>B. virginianum</i>) and Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium
filix femina</i>) also occured. Grasses included the forest
&ldquo;bluegrass&rdquo; <i>Poa alsodes</i>, Fowl Mannagrass (<i>Glyceria striata</i>) and Slender Mannagrass (<i>G. melicaria
</i>), Bottlebrush Grass (<i>Hystrix patula</i>), Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>), Autumn Bent (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>)
and Drooping Wood Reed Grass (<i>Cinna latifolia</i>). In places
there were large patches of the sedge <i>Carex laxiflora</i>, and in
springy areas, <i>Carex gynanadra</i>. More scattered were <i>Carex
debilis</i>, <i>C. intumescens</i> and <i>C. gracillima</i>. Both
Indian Turnip (<i>Aris&aelig;ma triphyllum</i>) and Green Dragon (<i>Aris&aelig;ma dracontium</i>) were observed. Violets were
represented by Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>). 
Round-leaf Violet (<i>V. rotundifolia</i>) and Sweet White Violet 
 (<i>V. blanda</i>). Mountain Bindweed, Canada Mayflower (
<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>), White Hellebore (<i>Veratrum viride
</i>) and White Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis montana </i>) emphasized
the elevation. Also on this list should be the northern Joe-pye Weed
<i>Eupatorium maculatum</i>, which however shared this habitat with
its more widespread congeners Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed (<i>E.
purpurea</i>) and White Snakeroot (<i>E. rugosum</i>). Others,
also more widespread in habitat, included Virginia and Woodland
Strawberries (<i>Fragaria virginiana</i> and<i> F. vesca</i>),
Hairy Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza claytonii</i>), Wood Nettle (<i>Laportia canadensis</i>), Calico Aster, Turtlehead (<i>Chelone
glabra</i>), Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>), Blue
Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i>), Curtis Goldenrod,
Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa uniflora</i>) and Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>). The dominantly Appalachian
Bleeding Heart (<i>Dicentia eximia</i>) also occurs here, and
although not noted on this side of the road, Wild Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>) was quite abundant on the other side. No
ericaceae were seen in this forest. 

<p>	The rock
which presumably underlies this sub summit forest is the
Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation, which in some places contains
carbonate beds. Nutrients from such beds could explain the relatively
rich mesic character of this forest.</p>
<p>	The
roadside in the vicinity of this forest was extraordinarily rich in
rank herbage and shrubbery that included Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens</i> sp.), various species of <i>Eupatorium</i>, Cow Parsnip (<i>Heracleum
maximum</i>), Red Elderberry (<i>Sambucus pubens</i>), Mountain
Maple (<i>Acer spicatum</i>), Columbine (<i>Aquilegia canadensis</i>), Mountain Ash (<i>Pyrus americana</i>), Red Raspberry (<i>Rubus strigosus</i>) and Thornless Blackberry. Both of the last
two named were heavy with ripe fruit. It is possible that this
vegetation was enhanced by the availability of lime from the gravel
as well as drainage interruption by the road.</p>
<p>	Little
opportunity was afforded for more than a cursory exploration of the
forest between 4500 ft (1370 meters) and the summit. However on
6-19-94 a brief observation was made of the forest interior near the
4700 (1430 meters) level. In contrast to the forest inventoried
below, the aspect here is westerly. The same general tree species
were present, but appeared stunted and may have been younger. The
ground flora is mesic and both White Wood Sorrel and Star Flower (<i>Trientalis borealis</i>) were in bloom.</p>
<p>	The
summit area of Spruce Knob presents a wild scene of jumbled rock
fields and wind-whipped vegetation. As in similar places in the
Alleghenies, the Red Spruce have banner forms that reveal the
direction of the prevailing wind, while their heavily-foliaged
branches interlock and lie flat against the rocks. Although the
summit vegetation was inventoried on both visits, that done on
8-11-96 was more detailed. On that visit a counter clockwise
traverse was made along the loop trail around the highest part of the
summit, beginning at the parking lot. Observations made on 6-19-94
were more scattered but complement the others. The tally of species
encountered along the loop trail is presented here in the order in
which they were noticed but does not imply that they occur nowhere
else on the summit. Scientific names in general are given only for
species not listed previously for the Mountain.</p>
<p>	At the
parking lot a low heath type vegetation dominates, with abundant
Early Low Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium angustifolium</i>) intergrown
with a dense, light colored, almost white, fructicose lichen that,
from its form and general field characteristics, is probably <i>Cladina
 rangiferina</i> or &ldquo;Reindeer Moss.&rdquo; Other heaths are
Southern Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium erythrocarpum</i>) and
Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia pilosa</i>). Lighting this August scene
were scattered tall blooms of Great Willow-herb (<i>Epilobium
angustifolium </i>). Proceeding along the trail we successively
encountered Mountain Holly, Thornless Blackberry with still -green
fruit, Red Maple, Painted Trillium (<i>Trillium undulatum</i>),
Canada Mayflower, Tree Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium obscurum</i>),
Common Clubmoss (<i>L. clavatum</i>), Wrinkled-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa</i>), Mountain Maple, Mountain Aster in bloom,
Hay-scented Fern, Cedar Waxwing birds (<i>Bombycilla cedrorum</i>) in spruce tops, Bunchberry (<i>Cornus canadensis</i>) with red
berries, low bushes of Bush Honeysuckle (<i>Diervilla lonicera</i>), also in the midst of the <i>Cladina</i> and Bracken Fern (
<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>). Most of these signal severe or boreal
habitats. However this sequence was then punctuated by tall blooms
of Cutleaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago arguta</i> var. <i>arguta </i>),
a species at home over a great range of elevations and habitats. 
Next recorded were Bleeding Heart, here in bloom; the alien Field
Sorrel (<i>Rumex acetosella</i>), Hairgrass, Plume Moss (<i>Ptillium crista-castrensis</i>), the equally conspicuous moss
Schreber&rsquo;s Hypnum (<i>Pleurozium schreberi</i>) and Yellow
Birch. Near the trail, on a rocky flat, a sort of &ldquo;boreal
garden&rdquo; attracted us with its tall white-flowered Pearly
Everlasting (<i>Anaphalis margaritacea</i>), stunted Red Raspberry
and clumps of grass and sedge (see photos). Nearby Appalachian
montane Downy Heuchera (<i>Heuchera pubescens</i>) elevated its
flower stalks in the shelter of quartzite blocks. In this vicinity
also, the bark of Red Spruce was host to lichens, including a
<i>Psedevernia</i>, perhaps <i>P. consocians</i> and a <i>Cetraria</i>
with conspicuous picnidia.</p>
<p>	Resuming
the inventory along the trail, we recorded the haircap moss
<i>Polytrichum junipernum</i>, Rough Cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla 
norvegica</i>), a circumpolar species both native and introduced; a
single clump of the sedge <i>Carex brunnescens</i>, a lover of &ldquo;dry
exposed mountain summits&rdquo; (Strausbaugh and Core, 1977) ; 
Smooth Gooseberry (<i>Ribes rotundifolia</i>), Red Elderberry, the
alien Meadow Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus acris</i>), the widespread
and South-ranging Rose Pink (<i>Sabatia angularis</i>), Mountain
Fern Moss (<i>Hylocomium splendens</i>), a Yellow Swallowtail
Butterfly (<i>Papilio</i> sp.), Fowl Mana Grass, White Snakeroot,
Red Fescue (<i>Festuca rubra</i>), Yarrow (<i>Achillea 
millefolium</i>) in bloom, Filmy Angelica (<i>Angelica triquinata
</i>), with both flowers and seeds; Red Raspberry, with ripe fruit
at the trail edge; Skunk Current (<i>Ribes glandulosum</i>),
always an indicator of cold climate; the alien Field Basil (<i>Satureja
vulgaris</i>) in bloom; Purple-leaved Willow-herb (<i>Epilobium 
coloratum</i>) in seed; Drooping Wood Reedgrass, a Winter Cress (<i>Barbarea</i> sp.) and a Wild Rye with spikes still sheathed (probably <i>Elymus canadensis</i>). Here also, although the weather
was cool, many unidentified small wild bees as well as bumblebee
workers as small as Honey Bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>), 
patronized <i>Eupatorium maculatum</i>. However no Honey Bees were
seen on the entire Mountain. Now, approaching the observation tower,
we encountered White Lettuce (<i>Prenanthes alba</i>), also in
bloom; Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>) in fruit; 
Tall Agrimony (<i>Agrimonia gryposepal</i>a) in seed and flower; 
a little of the alien Garlic Mustard (<i>Alliaria officinalis</i>) at the trail edge; Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>), in perhaps a patch of better than average soil; Silky Willow (<i>Salix sericea</i>), Virginia Strawberry, a Towhee (<i>Pipilo 
erythophthalmus</i>), the alien Vipers Bugloss (<i>Echium vulgare
</i>) and an unidentified hawthorn.</p>
<p>	Approaching
the turn of the trail to the southeast, above the rocky precipitous
slope, there is conspicuous Mountain Ash and Mountain Bindweed. Then
passing beneath a low spruce canopy, we saw successively Sweet White
Violet, White Wood Sorrel, Yellow Clintonia (<i>Clintonia borealis</i>), a lone Hemlock, an <i>Amanita flavoconia fungus</i>, haircap
moss (<i>Polytrichum</i> sp.) and a single plant of Nodding Onion (<i>Allium cernuum</i>), still not in bloom, and, as some other
plants here, a true &ldquo;accidental.&rdquo; Now, proceeding again
in the open among great rocks above the precipitous southeast slope,
we recorded the last of previously unrecorded plants, namely a single
plant of Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium virginianum</i>), Smooth
Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier l&aelig;vis</i>) with red berries,
<i>Leucobryum</i> cushion moss, Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster
macrophyllus</i>), Mountain Azalea (<i>Rhododendron roseum</i>),
the other &ldquo;Mountain Holly&rdquo; (<i>Nemopanthus mucranatus</i>)
and Pink Ladyslipper (<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>).</p>
<p>	Observations
on 6-19-94, a day on which the Mountain was wrapped in
thundershowers, disclosed additional species and seasonal variations
in the summit area. These included Fire Cherry (<i>Prunus 
pensylvanica</i>), the song of Veeries (<i>Catharus fuscescens</i>), and most interesting, two males of a reddish bird, most likely the
Purple Finch (<i>Carpodacus purpureus</i>), singing conspicuously
on the tops of two spruce, perhaps 200 ft (60 meters) apart. This
observation was followed by one equally exciting, namely the flight,
only a little above the treetops, of a large accipiter which could
only have been a Northern Goshawk (<i>Accipiter gentilis</i>). 
Noteworthy also was spotting several large rabbits, which may have
been New England Cottontails (<i>Sylvilagus transitionalis</i>). 
In short, the thundery skies, the birds and Bunchberry, Mountain Ash
and the Mountain Azalea in full-bloom, added a seasonal dimension to
our future August visit to these inspiring heights.</p>
<p>	The
observations recorded here may be compared to those made by Brooks
 (1910) eighty six years before on 6-18-08. Although his tally of
species is, in some respects, less complete than ours, he also
reported Bunchberry, Mountain Aster and Bleeding Heart in bloom. 
However, he also reported some plants we missed. These are White
Pine (<i>Pinus strobus</i>), Teaberry (<i>Gautheria procumbens
</i>), Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>), Black Huckleberry
 (<i>Gaylusscia baccata</i>), Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigea repens
</i>), Black Chokeberry (<i>Aronia melanocarpa</i>), Cinnamon Fern
 (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>), Large Round-leaved Orchid (<i>Habenaria orbiculata</i>) and Ground Pine.</p>
<p>	As noted
by Brooks as well as subsequent investigators, Spruce Mountain has a
fauna which to a large degree replicates that of the north. Examples,
in addition to those observed in our inventory, are Varying Hare (<i>Lepus americanus</i>), Red Squirrel (<i>Sciurus hudsonicus</i>), Southern Bog Lemming (<i>Synaptomys cooperi</i>), Swainson&rsquo;s
Thrush (<i>Catharus ustulatus</i>), Golden-crowned Kinglet (<i>Regulus satrapa</i>), as well as many others that occur at higher
elevations in the Central Appalachians.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
 The upper parts
of Spruce Mountain are comprised of a variety of habitats, although
all appear to have been heavily impacted by human activity. While
there are rich sub-summit forests, all appear to be not only
secondary but also young in age. The summit area of Spruce Knob, in
contrast to the sub-summit forests, is exposed to such severe
conditions of low and variable temperatures, high winds, ice and
other climatic stresses that recovery from natural or man-made
impacts is more difficult and far slower. These factors are expressed
in the floras, the amount of open areas, degree of vegetation
stunting and ruderal habitat. The different areas should be
considered in terms of general stability relations of their floras
with respect to microclimate, substrate and other environmental
factors that have shaped them and govern their species composition (
Mueller, 2000). </p>
<p>It was found
that although the sub-summit forest of Spruce Knob is home to a
wealth of northern and montane species, it is also rich in those with
wider distributions. In contrast the summit vegetation clearly
contains a higher proportion of cold climate species. These amount
to at least 25 boreal and 9 high elevation vascular plants, out of
nearly 80 recorded In addition, many of the other species also have
northern as well as temperate distributions. Also, if bryophytes are
considered, this pattern is sustained. However, the bryophtes also
exhibit another characteristic, namely an abundance of species both
common and those associated with disturbed habitats, according to
Crum and Anderson (1981) (here referred to as C&amp;A). For
example, <i>Bracythecium oxycladon</i>, one of the most frequently
occurring species at Spruce Knob, is generally common and widespread,
while <i>Bryum argentium</i> and <i>Ceratodon purpureus</i> are
cosmopolitan &quot;weed&quot; species (C&amp;A). A standout among
northerners is <i>Brachythecium campestre,</i> which according to
C&amp;A, has a range that extends only as far south as Pennsylvania
in the eastern US. Among many others with northern distributions that
extend south at higher elevations along the Appalachians to North
Carolina or Tennessee, are <i>Brachythecium</i> <i>curtum,
Brachythecium rutabulum, Encalpta procera, Dicranum fucescens,
Plagiothecium laetum</i> (&quot;usually in coniferous woods&quot;,
according to C&amp;A), <i>Pylaisiella</i> <i>polyantha</i> (
&quot;boreal&quot; according to C&amp;A) <i>Brotherella recurvans</i>
and <i>Tetraphis pellucida</i>., with the last two species
characteristic of a variety of northeastern coniferous forests.
Another interesting feature here is the small number of liverwort
species, which may reflect exposure to the drying effect of the rocky
soil and strong winds.</p>
