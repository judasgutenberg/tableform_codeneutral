<p>
This low prominence on the southwest end of Spruce Mountain has the distinction, at 
4861 feet (1482 meters) asl, of being the highest point in West Virginia.  Spruce 
Mountain is part of a syncline in which the highest part is composed of erosion-resistant 
Pottsville sandstone of Pennsylvanian age.  This is essentially the same rock that 
underlies much of the Plateau and upland of Dolly Sods, Canaan Mountain and other 
elevated Allegheny areas.  Ranging 3000 ft (910 meters) above the North Fork of the 
South Branch of the Potomac, the forests that clothe Spruce Mountain vary from rich mesophytic 
at low elevations through Appalachian and Northern Hardwoods at mid-elevations, to 
spruce montane or subalpine at the highest elevations.  After logging and catastrophic fires examples of the primary forest are confined to such remnants as the Fanny 
Bennett Hemlock grove (p._____).  Unfortunately the secondary forest has also been 
degraded by roads and clearcut logging.  At present much of the summit of Spruce 
Knob is covered by a spruce-heath type vegetation in which a variety of ericacea vie with thickets 
of stunted or shrubby and densely-foliated Red Spruce with branches spreading over 
the ground.  Dispersed among these major vegetation types  is a considerable diversity of lichens, bryophytes and flowering plants, many of which are boreal or high montane 
in distribution.<p>
Below the summit zone there is a well-developed canopy in which Northern Hardwoods 
are mixed with Red Spruce.  Doubtless this sub-summit but high elevation forest consisted 
predominantly of Red Spruce in its primary state and there is evidence that reversion is occurring at present.<p>
Our first report here is of brief observations made on 8-11-96 at the Spruce Knob 
Lake campground, which lies at about 4000 ft (1220 meters) elevation.  Although no 
detailed inventory was done, The following features were noted: The canopy here consists 
of young to mature (perhaps 50 years in age) Beech, Red and Sugar Maples and Black 
Cherry, with Striped Maple in the understory and Thornless Blackberry (<i>Rubus canadensis</i>) at the forest edge.  The only herbs seen in the time available were Curtis Goldenrod 
(<i>Solidago curtisii</i>), Mountain Bindweed (<i>Polygonum cilinode</i>), Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennst&aelig;dtia punctilobula</i>), Spinulose Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>), Calico Aster (<i>Aster lateriflorus</i>), White Avens (<i>Geum canadense</i>) and Haircap (<i>Polytrichum juniperium</i>) and other mosses.  A 16 inch (41 cm) dbh Red Maple contained a conspicuous tree 
moss that formed little mounds (cushions) perhaps 2-3 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm high 
(in a horizontal direction) and oval in form.  From the vase-like capsule form this 
was probably an <i>Orthotrichum</i>
.<p>
A more detailed inventory was done of the forest interior on the southeast slope of 
Spruce Knob at near the 4500 ft (1370 meter) level.  The location of this site is 
just upslope from Forest Road 112, less than a mile northeast of the road fork and 
the 4532 (1381 meter) benchmark.  The canopy here is young, perhaps less than 50 years in 
age.  Trees in approximate order of abundance are Yellow Birch, Beech, Sugar Maple, 
Red Spruce, Black Cherry, Northern Red Oak and White Ash, with an understory of Striped 
Maple, Hawthorn, including Dotted Thorn (<i>Crat&aelig;gus punctata</i>) and Alternate-leaved Dogwood (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i>).  The herb-layer is dominated by Mountain Aster (<i>Aster acuminatus</i>) with abundant New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis</i>) and the deciduous Spinulose Fern <i>Dryopteris carthusiana</i>
.  There is also some <i>D. intermedia</i>
 and the Mountain Wood Fern <i>D. campyloptera</i>
, a species usually confined to high elevations and frost pockets.  Cut-leaf Grapefern 
(<i>Botrychium dissectum</i>), Rattlesnake Fern (<i>B. virginianum</i>) and Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium filix femina</i>) also occur.  Grasses include the forest "Blue Grass" <i>Poa alsodes</i>
, the Mana Grasses <i>Glyceria striata</i>
 and <i>G. melicaria</i>
, Bottlebrush Grass (<i>Hystrix patula</i>), Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>), Autumn Bent (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>) and Drooping Wood Reed Grass (<i>Cinna latifolia</i>).  In places there are large patches of the sedge <i>Carex laxiflora</i>
 , and in springy areas, <i>Carex gynanadra</i>
.  More scattered were <i>Carex debilis</i>
, <i>C. intumescens</i>
 and <i>C. gracillima</i>
.  Both Indian Turnip (<i>Aris&aelig;ma triphyllum</i>) and Green Dragon (<i>Aris&aelig;ma dracontium</i>) were observed.  Violets were represented by Downy Wood (<i>Viola sororia</i>).  Round-leaf (<i>V. rotundifolia</i>) and Sweet White (<i>V. blanda</i>).  Mountain Bindweed, Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>), White Hellebore (<i>Veratrum viride</i>) and White Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis montana</i>) emphasize the elevation.  Also on this list should be the northern Joe-pye Weed 
<i>Eupatorium maculatum</i>
, which however shares this habitat with its more widespread congeners Wide-leaved 
Joe-pye Weed (<i>E. purpurea</i>) and White Snakeroot (<i>E. rugosum</i>).  Others also more widespread in habit include Virginia and Woodland Strawberries 
(<i>Fragaria virginiana</i>
 and<i> F. vesca</i>), Hairy Sweet Cicely (<i>Osmorhiza claytoni</i>), Wood Nettle (<i>Laportia canadensis</i>), Calico Aster, Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>), Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>), Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i>), Curtis Goldenrod, Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa uniflora</i>) and Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>), illustrating a substrate rich enough for more demanding species.  The dominantly 
Appalachian Bleeding Heart (<i>Dicentia eximia</i>) also occurs here, and although not noted on this side of the road, Wild Sarsaparilla 
(<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>) was quite abundant on the other side.  No ericac&aelig; were seen in this forest. <p>
The rock which presumably underlies this sub summit forest is the Mississippian Mauch 
Chunk Formation, which in some places contains carbonate beds. Nutrients from such 
beds could explain the relatively rich mesic character of this forest.<p>
The roadside in the vicinity of this forest is extraordinarily rich in rank herbage 
and shrubbery that includes Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens</i>
  sp.), various species of <i>Eupatorium</i>
, Cow Parsnip (<i>Heracleum maximum</i>), Red Elderberry (<i>Sambucus pubens</i>), Mountain Maple (<i>Acer spicatum</i>), Columbine (<i>Aquilegia canadensis),</i>
 Mountain Ash (<i>Pyrus americana</i>), Red Raspberry (<i>Rubus strigosus</i>) and Thornless Blackberry.  Both of the last two named were heavy with ripe fruit. 
 It is possible that this vegetation was enhanced by the availability of lime from 
the gravel as well as drainage interruption by the road.<p>
Little opportunity was afforded for more than a cursory exploration of the forest 
between 4500 ft (1370 meters) and the summit.  However on 6-19-94  a brief observation 
was made of the forest interior near the 4700 (1430 meters) level.  In contrast to 
the forest inventoried below, the aspect here is westerly.  The same general tree species 
were present, but appeared stunted and may have been younger.  The ground flora is 
mesic and both White Wood Sorrel and Star Flower (<i>Trientalis borealis</i>) were in bloom.<p>
The summit area of Spruce Knob presents a wild scene of jumbled rock fields and wind-whipped 
vegetation. As in similar places in the Alleghenies, the Red Spruce have banner  
forms that reveal the direction of the prevailing wind, while their heavily-foliaged branches interlock and lie flat against the rocks.  Although the summit vegetation 
was inventoried on both visits, that done on 8-11-96 was more detailed.  On that 
visit a counter clockwise traverse was made along the loop trail around the highest 
part of the summit, beginning at the parking lot.  Observations made on 6-19-94 were more 
scattered but complement the others.  The tally of species encountered along the 
loop trail is presented here in the order in which they were noticed but does not 
imply that they occur nowhere else on the summit.  Scientific names in general are given 
only for species not listed previously for the Mountain.<p>
At the parking lot a low heath type vegetation dominates, with abundant Early Low 
Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium angustifolium</i>) intergrown with a dense, light colored, almost white, fructicose lichen that, from 
its form and general field characteristics, is probably <i>Cladina rangiferina</i>
 or "Reindeer Moss."  Other heaths are Southern Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium erythrocarpum</i>) and Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia pilosa</i>).  Lighting this August scene were scattered tall blooms of Great Willow-herb (<i>Epilobium angustifolium</i>).  Proceeding along the trail we successively encountered Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana</i>), Thornless Blackberry with still -green fruit, Red Maple, Painted Trillium (<i>Trillium undulatum</i>), Canada Mayflower, Tree Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium obscurum</i>), Common Clubmoss (<i>L. clavatum</i>), Wrinkled-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa</i>), Mountain Maple, Mountain Aster in bloom, Hay-scented Fern, Cedar Waxwings in spruce 
tops, Bunchberry (<i>Cornus canadensis</i>) with red berries, low bushes of Bush Honeysuckle (<i>Diervilla lonicera</i>), also in the midst of the <i>Cladina</i>
 and Bracken Fern (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>).  Most of these signal severe or boreal habitats.  However this sequence was then 
punctuated by tall blooms of Cutleaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago arguta</i>
 var. <i>arguta</i>), a species at home over a great range of elevations and habitats.  Next recorded 
were Bleeding Heart, here in bloom; the alien Field Sorrel (<i>Rumex acetosella</i>), Hairgrass (<i>Agrostis hyemalis</i>), Plume Moss (<i>Ptillium crista-castrensis</i>), the equally conspicuous moss Schreber's Hypnum (<i>Pleurozium schreberi</i>) and Yellow Birch.  Near the trail, on a rocky flat, a sort of "boreal garden" attracted 
us with its tall white-flowered  Pearly Everlasting (<i>Anaphalis margaritacea</i>), stunted Red Raspberry and clumps of grass and sedge.  Nearby Appalachian montane 
Downy Heuchera (<i>Heuchera pubescens</i>) elevated its flower stalks in the shelter of quartzite blocks.  In this vicinity 
also, the bark of Red Spruce was host to lichens, including a <i>Psedevernia</i>
, perhaps <i>P. consocians</i>
  and a <i>Cetraria</i>
 with conspicuous picnidia.<p>
Resuming the inventory along the trail we recorded the haircap moss <i>Polytrichum junipernum</i>
, rough Cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla norvegica</i>), a circumpolar species both native and introduced;  a single clump of <i>Carex brunnescens</i>
, a lover of "dry exposed mountain summits";  Smooth Gooseberry (<i>Ribes rotundifolia</i>), Red Elderberry, the alien Meadow Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus acris</i>), the widespread and South-ranging Rose Pink (<i>Sabatia angularis</i>), Mountain Fern Moss (<i>Hylocomium splendens</i>), a Yellow Swallowtail Butterfly (<i>Papilio</i>
 sp.), Fowl Mana Grass, White Snakeroot, Red Fescue (<i>Festuca rubra</i>), Yarrow (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>) in bloom, Filmy Angelic (<i>Angelica triquinata</i>), with both flowers and seeds;  Red Raspberry, with ripe fruit at the trail edge; 
 Skunk Current (<i>Ribes glandulosum</i>) always an indicator of cold climate; the alien Field Basil (<i>Satureja vulgaris</i>), in bloom; Purple-leaved Willow-herb (<i>Epilobium coloratum</i>) in seed; Drooping Wood Reedgrass, a Winter Cress (<i>Barbarea</i>
  sp.) and a Wild Rye with spikes still sheathed (probably <i>Elymus canadensis</i>).  Here also, although the weather was cool, many small bees and Bumblebee workers 
as small as Honey Bees, patronized <i>Eupatorium maculatum</i>
.  However no Honey Bees were seen on the entire Mountain.  Now, approaching the observation 
tower, we encountered White Lettuce (<i>Prenanthes alba</i>), also in bloom; Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>) in fruit;  Tall Agrimony (<i>Agrimonia gryposepal</i>
a) in seed and flower;  a little of the alien Garlic Mustard (<i>Alliaria officinalis</i>) at the trail edge;  Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>), in perhaps a patch of better than average soil;  Silky Willow (<i>Salix sericea</i>), Virginia Strawberry, a Towhee, the alien Vipers Bugloss (<i>Echium vulgare</i>) and a Hawthorn.<p>
Approaching the turn of the trail to the southeast, above the rocky precipitous slope, 
there is conspicuous Mountain Ash and Mountain Bindweed.  Then passing beneath a 
low spruce canopy, we see successively Sweet White Violet, White Wood Sorrel, Yellow 
Clintonia (<i>Clintonia borealis</i>), a lone Hemlock, an <i>Amanita flavoconia</i>
, Haircap Moss (<i>Polytrichum</i>
 sp.) and a single plant of Nodding Onion (<i>Allium cernuum</i>) still not in bloom, and, as some other plants here, a true "accidental."  Now, proceeding 
again in the open among great rocks above the precipitous southeast slope, we record 
the last of previously unrecorded plants, namely a single plant of Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium virginianum</i>), Smooth Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier l&aelig;vis</i>) with red berries, <i>Leucobryum</i>
 cushion moss, Big-leaf Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i>), Rose Azalea (<i>Rhododendron roseum</i>), the other "Mountain Holly" (<i>Nemopanthus mucranata</i>) and Moccasin Flower (<i>Cypripedium acaule</i>).<p>
Observations on 6-19-94, a day on which the Mountain was wrapped in thundershowers, 
disclosed additional species and seasonal variations in the summit area.  These included 
Fire Cherry (<i>Prunus pensylvanica</i>), the song of Veeries, and most interesting, two males of a reddish bird, most likely 
the Purple Finch (<i>Carpodacus purpureus</i>), singing conspicuously on the tops of two spruce, perhaps 200 ft (60 meters) apart. 
 This observation was followed by one equally exciting, namely the flight, only  
little above the tree tops, of a large accipiter which could only have been a Northern 
Goshawk.  Noteworthy also was spotting several large Rabbits, which may have been New 
England Cottontails (<i>Sylvilagus transitionalis</i>).  In short the thundery skies, the birds and Bunchberry, Mountain Ash and Rose Azalea 
in full-bloom added a seasonal dimension to our August visit to these inspiring heights.<p>
The observations recorded here may be compared to those made by Brooks (1910) eighty 
six years before on 6-18-08.   Although his tally of species is, in some respects, 
less complete than ours, he also reported Bunchberry, Mountain Aster and Bleeding 
Heart in bloom.  However he also reported some plants we missed.  These are White Pine, 
Teaberry (<i>Gautheria procumbens</i>), Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>), Black Huckleberry (<i>Gaylusscia baccata</i>), trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigea repens</i>), Black Chokeberry (<i>Aronia melanocarpa</i>), Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>), Large Round-leaved Orchid (<i>Habenaria orbiculata</i>) and Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>).<p>
As noted by Brooks as well as subsequent investigators, Spruce Mountain has a fauna 
which to a large degree replicates that of the north. Examples in addition to those 
observed in our inventory are varying hare (<i>Lepus americanus</i>), Red Squirrel (<i>Sciurus hudsonicus</i>), Southern Bog Lemming (<i>Synaptomys cooperi</i>), Swainson's Thrush (<i>Catharus ustulatus</i>), Golden-crowned Kinglet (<i>Regulus satrapa</i>), as well as many others that occur at higher elevations in the Central Appalachians.<p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<p>
It was found that although the subsummit forest of Spruce Knob contains a wealth of 
northern and high montane species, it is also rich in those of wider distributions. 
 In contrast the summit vegetation clearly contains a higher proportion of cold climate species.  These amount to at least 25 boreal and 9 high montane plants out of about 
75 species recorded.  In addition many of the other species also have northern as 
well as temperate and southern distributions.  Some absences may also be significant. 
 Thus although Black Birch and Bear Oak (<i>Quercus ilicifolia</i>) are common on cold heaths and mountain tops to at least 4000 ft (1220 meters) elevation, 
neither were observed here.  This seems to indicate that the lapse rate cooling on 
Spruce Knob equals or surpasses that of the highest air drainage/accumulation basins at this latitude.<p>
