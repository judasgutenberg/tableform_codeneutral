Morse  (1988) 



<p> Forest
ecology treats of development, stable characteristics and changes in forest
ecosystems. Among its subjects are biochemical mechanisms of nutrient
assimilation and utilization, effects of climate change, succession and genetic
variation to name a few. However, central to most investigations is the
question of the occurrence of a particular species in a given location at a
given time. In answering this question there has properly been great emphasis
on mechanisms and frequently on time rates of change. But there is another
aspect of this central question that has received little systematic attention,
namely factors of the mode of occurrence of species, floral and faunal, which
are relatively independent of mechanisms and time rates of change, but bear on
fundamental stability. An attempt is made here to identify such factors in some
detail and to relate them to more familiar aspects of forest ecology, to
identify an underlying structure. In order to do this it is useful to draw upon
the bordering field of chemical mineralogy, a field which is also necessary to
elucidate the relation of forests to their mineral substrates.

<p> In addition
to meshing directly with biology, mineral chemistry, and in particular its
guiding discipline, chemical thermodynamics, provides a template for the study
of biologic species in relation to their environment  (Mueller, 1998).  In
thermodynamics the concept of equilibrium is rigorously defined as the
condition under which the free energy of the system as a whole is at a minimum
 (Gibbs, 1957).  A useful concept here also is that of <i>metastability</i>, in
which a system is in a low, but not the lowest free energy state  (or more
generally, in a stable, but not the most stable state). The concept, as
applicable in thermodynamics was defined by Guggenheim  (1950)  as follows:

<p>&quot;…the equilibrium of a thermodynamic system may be<i>
absolutely stable</i>. On the other hand it may be stable compared with all
states differing only infinitesimally from the given state, but unstable compared
to some other state differing finitely from the given state; such states are
called<i>metastable</i>.&quot; For non-thermodynamic equilibria,
as applicable to forest ecology, it will be necessary to take some liberties
with this definition.

<p>One of the most elegant of the
physical sciences, a strength of thermodynamics lies in its independence of
specific mechanisms involved in any process. Virtually all that is required to
determine stability or potential change of state  (freezing, melting, chemical transformation
etc.)  is a knowledge of the thermal and volumetric properties of chemical
phases-in this case minerals- which may be obtained with relative ease by
calorimetric and related measurements.
From these data the stability fields or ranges of a great variety of minerals and mineral assemblages with
respect to state variables such as temperature, pressure and chemical
concentrations may be obtained. These data may then be employed in the
recognition and interpretation of natural equilibrium assemblages under the
microscope or in the field. One can, for example, determine under what
conditions substrate minerals such as calcium carbonate and silica can coexist
stably or react to form other minerals. Also reactions which fix pH  (1) 
,oxygen concentration or other parameters can be identified. All this can be
done without knowledge of the specific – often complex – mechanisms that are
necessary for these reactions to occur. Furthermore, the equilibria associated
with such reactions are – within certain kinetic constraints – independent of
the direction from which they are approached. Thus the same equilibria may be
achieved whether the system is heated from below the equilibrium temperature or
cooled from above, or the pressure decreased or increased to the required
value. The existence of a multitude of such paths and associated mechanisms is
of no consequence to thermodynamics, which bestows a unique power of generality
that is applicable to the most diverse systems of nature and undergirds virtually
all industrial processes as well.

<p> In mineral
systems of metamorphic terrain, in which thermodynamic equilibrium is most
closely approached as a result of pervasive recrystallization, its clearest
manifestations were predicted by Ramberg  (1952)  and later confirmed by Kretz
 (1959)  and Mueller  (1960). These manifestations include the precise
distributions of chemical elements and
isotopes between coexisting minerals and consistent associations of these
phases in multidimensional composition 
fields  (phase volumes)  as expressed in phase diagrams. Important parts of these diagrams are the
derived phase  (specific mineral)  boundaries that limit the occurrence of
phases in terms of state variables. Kinetic constraints on such systems were
discussed by Mueller and Saxena  (1977)  and most recently by Kretz  (1994), 
who has also discussed the different forms of stability. Although more
difficult to determine for mineral assemblages 
formed under Earth surface conditions, and which form the substrates of forests,
associations predicted by thermodynamic analysis are also prevalent in these 
cases  (Garrels, 1960). 

<p> An
important feature of chemical phase diagrams which also appears to be
applicable to forest stability relations is the independence of equilibrium
conditions in any stability field from the amounts of the various phases in a
field or phase volume. Only presence or absence of phases determine a given
equilibrium and these conditions are expressed in the famous Gibbs phase rule, while the relative abundance of each
phase depends on the bulk composition. An extension to forest stability
relations follows from a postulated 
analogy between biologic species
and mineral phases. While there is
nothing corresponding to the phase rule in biology, the number of stable plant
species in a given community is clearly a function of nutrient availability, a
relation analogous to the relation between the numbers of phases and chemical
components.

<p> In forests
too, a condition analogous to equilibrium in mineral systems is approached
rather closely. The most familiar example is the concept of the climax
community. The characteristics and criteria of climax forests have been
discussed by Braun  (1950)  and Mueller  (1996).  Other evidence for the
attainment of some measure of equilibrium is the consistent occurrence of
well-defined plant communities as implied by the applicability of such
approaches as the Braun-Blanquet tabular analysis of these communities
(Westhoff and van der Maarel, 1973). 

<p> Among
pioneers who called attention to specific consistent relations between plants
and their mineral substrates are Wherry  (1916,1920),  Kelley  (1921), 
Reynolds and Potzger  (1953)  and Kuchler 1972). To these must also be added
Braun  (1950)  due to her numerous incidental references to this type of
relationship.

<p> Characteristics
of forest ecosystems that appear to parallel closely those of mineral
assemblages are the following:

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
applicability the
general criteria of equilibrium  (Braun, 1950, Mueller, 1996),  including those
of metastability

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
faithful reflection of system chemistry as represented by
substrate and atmospheric inputs

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
faithful reflection of temperature

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
occurrence of predictable associations  (communities), 
including compatible and incompatible species

<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
mutual equilibrium between all parts of the community

<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bounded and overlapping stability fields of species

<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
mechanism – independent character of equilibrium

<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
paramount importance of presence and absence of a species over
the number of individuals of that species

<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
spatial and temporal limits on equilibrium  (kinetic barriers) 



<p>Although forest
ecosystems may meet the general criteria of equilibrium, they

<p>are never in thermodynamic equilibrium.  (2)  The reason for
this is the presence of numerous gradients in state variables such as
temperature and concentrations of chemical components. Furthermore, although
the climax community is recognized as the best example of equilibrium, our
treatment of forest stability also must include communities that have not
attained climax. What such communities share with the climax communities is the
continuity, if but for a short while, of the life cycle of their species.
Experience teaches us that although in a stage of succession to a climax state,
members of such a transitional community are compatible with the substrate,
climate, light characteristics etc. Acidiphile species do not, for example,
establish themselves in an alkaline environment; nor will mesic species be part
of xeric or hydric communities. In general, no matter the stage of succession,
species faithfully reflect habitat requirements. However species may at times
become unstable or metastable as a result of changes in substrate, climate or
other state variables. It has been shown, for example (Armson, 1979),  that
forest fires may increase the pH of shallow soil layers by several units and
this effect may require decades to disappear. Thus certain acidiphile plants
might become temporarily unstable or metastable. In many places in the Central
Appalachians alteration of the substrate through human activities has been
profound. In particular rich mesic
forests originally developed on shale lost their readily erodable top soils and
were replaced by far less diverse xeric and acidic types in which only a thin
mor soil layer lies over bedrock. 

<p> It is
likely that in addition to the obvious state variables such as temperature,
chemical composition and light characteristics. in forests we must consider the
duration and seasonality of suitable soil temperature and moisture. Mutual
equilibrium among different parts of a community may be achieved – as it
frequently is in mineral assemblages –
by omnipresent media, in this case soil and atmosphere with associated nutrient
cycling. One manifestation is the generally observed compatibility of shrub and
herb species with the arboreal layer. Thus acidiphile herbs such as <i>Gaultheria</i>,
<i>Goodyera</i> and <i>Chimaphila</i> characterize ericaceous oak and
coniferous forests, while calciphiles such as Large-flowered Bellwort (<i>Uvularia grandiflora</i>),  Sharplobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica
 acutiloba</i>) and Seneca
Snakeroot (<i>Polygala senega</i>) 
are associated with calciphile trees such as Black Maple (<i>Acer nigrum</i>),  Chinquapin Oak  (<i>Quercus muehlenbergii</i>) and Hackberry (<i>Celtis occidentalis</i>).  A likely explanation is
that both trees and herbs draw their nutrients from the same shallow root zone.
Soil and rock mosses also appear to parallel these distributions, with species
of <i>Polytrichum </i>and<i>Dicranum </i>practically<i></i> confined to acid microhabitats and those of <i>Atrichum</i>
concentrated in more alkaline habitats, and in general acidiphile and
calciphile bryophytes are
well-recognized by bryologists. It seems likely that many other examples of
these types of compatibilities await discovery. As in the case of mineral
systems, simple observation of associated species is frequently adequate to
identify equilibrium communities. Directions of change too may be recognized by
certain species dropping out and being replaced by others as stability field
boundaries are crossed.

<p> Independence
of mechanism signifies that, while a multiplicity of complex mechanisms enter
into the establishment of most equilibria in plant communities, knowledge of
these mechanisms is not necessary to identify equilibrium, the resulting
stability fields and field boundaries. Such identification may be achieved by
use of the general criteria of equilibrium.

<p> The
relative importance of the abundance of individuals of a species in a community
and its presence or absence requires an in depth discussion of examples as
presented later in this paper. Finally, as in mineral systems, the attainment
of equilibrium throughout the extent of a community is limited by kinetic
barriers which impose severe spatial and temporal limits on communication
between different parts of the community. Such barriers universally restrict
the velocities of diffusion and biochemical as well as linked inorganic
chemical reactions. As in mineral systems, these barriers contribute to metastability,
although this state is more complex in biologic than in purely chemical systems
and is more than a thermochemical phenomenon in the former as discussed
elsewhere here and earlier  (Mueller, 1998).  An example provided earlier (Mueller, 1998)  is the successful planting of species outside their ranges,
which nonetheless thrive but fail to reproduce. Recalling Guggenheims
definition, such species survive slight perturbations of climate, but if
destroyed by a large perturbation, can not recover because there are no viable
propagules. Perhaps one of the most important consequences of these kinetic
barriers is the existence of microhabitats.

<p> To identify
the stability fields of plants it is necessary to observe a broad array of
occurrences and associations in the field and relate these occurrences to the
substrate, topography and climate. In the short term the only reliable
criterion is the presence of a species at a given site, but in the long run,
consistency of absence assumes equal importance. The reason for the distinction
is that presence may with great confidence be attributed to compatibility with
the site in either a stable or metastable sense, while absence may result from
a number of causes such as lack of seed sources, consumption by browsers and
temporary exclusion by succession.

<p> Before
further analysis it is necessary to discuss specific plant communities. Figures
1 and 2 are deduced stability diagrams for some common and a few less-common
woody species from the Central Appalachians. The relations shown are based on a
great number of field observations by the writer as well as from the
literature. However these interpretations are still very tentative and
approximate. The choice of axes for these diagrams is based on both convenience
and importance. Soil moisture and pH are recognized as of almost universal
importance in biochemical processes  (Edsall and Wyman, 1958) and their effects
are readily recognizable in the field. Nutrients such as calcium, magnesium
etc. are assumed to fall in the normal range except that depletion of some of
these accompanies low values of pH as a result of acid leaching, and for
possible other reasons. These types of relations will be touched upon later in
this paper.

<p> Nutrients
play critical roles in the growth of plants, but their observed abundances in
soil samples may not indicate their availability for assimilation and growth.
Availability may in fact be greatly influenced by pH  (Armson, 1977),  and
although high values of bases such as Ca and Mg are generally associated with
high pH, it is difficult to correlate nutrient abundances with plant species
and communities.

<p> Both
moisture and pH present serious problems of measurement and interpretation.
Although pH may be determined by a variety of methods with relative ease, the
meaning of some of the results may be in doubt. Furthermore, the range over
many orders of magnitude of ionic concentration or activity gives an illusion
of accuracy and precision that may
mislead. Of necessity the positions of the field boundaries along the moisture
axis are only relative, since there are few if any measurements of soil
moisture – precise and reliable that they may be –which, as we shall see, bear
meaningfully on stability. For example, Blackman and Ware  (1982)  attempted to
distinguish the dependencies on soil moisture levels of Chestnut Oak (<i>Quercus prinus</i>) and Northern Red Oak (<i>Q. rubra</i>) during the growing season at two
sites in the Blue Ridge Mountains. In their experiments moisture levels were
determined at 15 cm depths in each case. However Metz and Douglas  (1959) 
found that while moisture content  (in this case under pine)  was depleted at
depths below 76 cm, higher levels were maintained at the 0 to 76 cm depths.
Although a full discussion was not provided by the latter authors or by Armson
 (1979),  in whose book they were referenced, a ready physiological explanation
suggests itself. Critical to this explanation is the recognition that the fine
feeder roots in the shallow zone must be kept moist to enable nutrient uptake to occur, a presumed priority
function coordinated between shallow and deep roots. If this explanation is
correct, the bearing on stability of measurements such as those of Blackman and
Ware are thrown into doubt, although they may be important in other respects.

<p> It is
informative to compare the two axes of the figures in terms of their scales.
The total range of pH observed in all Appalachian forest types is six orders of
magnitude or so in ionic concentration, whereas the variation at any given site
over time is usually considerably less than an order of magnitude, or one pH
unit. On the other hand, moisture content is seldom observed to vary more than
two orders of magnitude throughout all forest types, but may vary almost one
order of magnitude at a given site over time. Thus pH is more stable at any
given site than moisture content relative to total range of variability.
However pH, like moisture content, may vary greatly with soil depth. Although
moisture content of a soil, like pH, is here regarded as an intensive variable,
it is fundamentally different from the latter. pH appears to be more a
characteristic of a particular soil layer at a specific location, and is thus
part of a microhabitat, although it may vary somewhat in response to weather
inputs. It is frequently possible however, to obtain closely similar readings
of soil pH at greatly different times and under different weather conditions.
An example is soil immediately beneath mats of <i>Polytrichum</i> and <i>Dicranum</i>
mosses. In contrast soil moisture may vary substantially and rapidly in
response to weather inputs. Thus it is more characteristic of climate, weather
and soil texture that governs retention, as illustrated once more by the data
of Metz and Douglas  (1959),  as well as other examples provided by Armson (1977). 

<p> Additional
complications arise in determining the moisture component significant to
long-term plant stability. It seems reasonable, for example, that soil moisture
has greater significance during the growing season than during the dormant
season and that the duration and temperature of this seasonal concentration are
also significant. It may even be true that the occurrence of certain species
such as Chestnut Oak and Pitch Pine (<i>Pinus 
rigida</i>) are governed in part by periodic moisture deficits that
preclude mesic species. Consequently soil moisture in the Figures 1 and 2 is,
at this stage, based on general observations of the occurrence of species in
relation to environmental factors such as topographic position and character of
substrate as well as community type.

<p> While the
saturation limit of Figs. 1 and 2 is relatively easy to identify in the field,
its precise location may be blurred by the velocity of water movement. Soils
saturated by oxygen-rich waters may affect plants differently than those under
stagnant saturation and a great number of observations may be required to
clarify this situation. The dry soil limit is considerably more uncertain than
the saturation limit but may tentatively be taken to lie beyond the limits of
occurrence of such species as Pitch Pine and certain ericaceous shrubs such as
Black Huckleberry (<i>Gaylussacia 
baccata</i>).  Among such limiting occurrences may be a rock outcrop
community described by Abrams and Orwig  (1995)  from the Shawangunk Mountains
of southwestern New York State. In any case, there appears to be a strong
general correlation between the ocurrence of species such as Chestnut Oak and
xeric sites.

<p> Although
the locations of stability fields and their boundaries in the figures are based
on field data, their general configuration is derived from principle. Using
Chestnut Oak as an example, we note that as the high pH stability limit is
approached we should expect diminished stability with respect to both high and
low moisture as well, since the system as a whole is under stress. Consequently
closed curved configurations of stability field boundaries are to be expected.

<p> One of the
firmest determinations of field boundaries is that of White Ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>) very near the saturation
limit in the vicinity of pH=7. This species may be observed at the edge of a
calcareous wetland in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia  (Hunsucker and
Mueller, 1998),  where its feeder roots lie just above the saturation zone (
here comprised of slowly moving spring water)  and deeper roots penetrate it.
White Ash is at this site separated by ten meters from a well-drained natural
levee which supports Black Walnut (<i>Juglans 
nigra</i>),  a species that cannot abide wet soils. This ash has also been
observed by the writer at the edge of a swamp in calcareous terrain in
east-central Wisconsin.

<p> The
intersection of the Red Maple (<i>Acer 
rubrum</i>) stability field and the acid-soil saturation limit is
well-established by the common occurrence of Red Maple swamps. Similarly, the
general positions of the Chinquapin Oak and Black Maple fields in the
circumneutral/alkaline range of pH has been observed in the field by the writer
and is well-documented in the literature  (Deam, 1940; Reynolds and Potzger, 1953;
Fowells, 1965) 

<p> Acid ranges
in pH of some species of interest may be inferred from the data of Rawinski <i>et
al</i>  (1994)  and Fleming and Moorhead  (2000).   (3)  These are as follows:



<p>
<table width=400>
<tr bgcolor=cccccc>
<td>  Species </td>

<td> Range  </td>

<td> Data Points  </td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor=ffffcc>
<td>
<p><i>Quercus prinus</i></td><td>3.4–
6.1</td><td>41

</td>

<tr bgcolor=cccccc>

<p><i>Acer rubrum</i></td><td>3.4

</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor=ffffcc>
<td>

<p><i>Acer saccharum</i></td><td>4.4 – 6.7</td><td>9

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p> These
values may be compared directly with Figures 1 and 2, which were derived
independently of them. However the limit of 6.7 for <i>Acer rubrum</i> seems high and may result from
combining samples as discussed in note  (3). 

<p> While no
corresponding data were found for Beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>),  the range of this species was inferred from
limited data in Fowells  (1965)  and the writer's observations. For example,
the writer has observed that Beech planted on shallow soil above limestone is
unstable unless the soil is acidified. To a degree a similar paucity of data
exists in the case of Sugar Maple (<i>Acer 
saccharum</i>),  as well as the dry soil limits of White Ash and Red
Maple. However, the relative positions of the field boundaries of Red Maple,
Beech, Sugar Maple and White Ash in the sequence from low to higher pH in mesic
forests appears to be quite well established as shown in Figure 1.

<p> It must
also be kept in mind that the ranges of White Ash and Sugar Maple extend well
into the alkaline range as is shown by a great variety of occurrences.
Additionally, the range of Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>) likely extends to higher pH
ranges than shown in the table. For example, the writer has observed this shrub
in soil with pH as high as 5.2 in a forest that included Chestnut Oak, Red
Maple and White Ash.

<p>Of some interest are the positions
of the Black Oak (<i>Quercus velutina</i>) and Chestnut Oak fields as
elucidated in calcareous terrain. There Chestnut Oak is limited to deep,
leached soils or chert areas and never coexists with Chinquapin Oak. However
Black Oak is clearly more widely distributed than either of the aforementioned
oaks and is a familiar of very acidic terrain throughout the Appalachians as
well as calcareous terrain, in which it is associated with Chinquapin Oak on
limestone outcrops. It appears to be more moisture tolerant than either of the
other two oaks and drops out on the driest sites where Chestnut Oak thrives.




<p> The
affinity of Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) for moist acidic sites is well known. Less familiar
is the apparent extension of its stability field to calcareous sites where the
writer obtained readings of pH=6.0 from highly organic soil in the root zone of
this rhododendron immediately above massive limestone. However it is apparently
excluded from colluvium below such outcrops, since such sites are usually
subject to more alkaline solutions from above.

<p> Although
few pH data exist for Maleberry (<i>Lyonia 
ligustrina</i>),  its occurrence in wet acidic sites is well documented.
Ogle  (1989)  however provided evidence that the range of this shrub also
extends to more alkaline wetlands as well, and an estimate of this range is
shown in Figure 2.

<p> 

<p> 

<p>It is necessary at this point to
consider more of the general characteristics of the stability diagrams.
Although the diagrams are at best two dimensional slices through
multidimensional space, they are potentially far more complex than this since
other components than those represented by the two axes are not necessarily of
constant value throughout the diagrams. The stability relations shown may be –
and likely are – projections on the planes shown. Thus if, as is likely, such
components as calcium, magnesium, nitrogen etc. were to vary independently
across the diagrams, the field boundaries should shift or be blurred from
community to community. Examples of this effect are changes in pH and moisture
content induced by variation of other components such as the bases calcium and
magnesium. Indeed, it seems highly probable that the common decreases in pH
associated with vertical leaching is precisely of this kind.A caveat also needs
to be considered with regard to seedlings. It is well known that seedlings of a
number of forest trees exhibit greater tolerance to shade than do mature members
of the same species. Is it not possible that there is also a greater tolerance
toward other growing conditions and that this is equivalent to expanded
stability fields for seedlings? It
is also necessary to clarify the considerable differences between diagrams such
as Figures 1 and 2 and mineral stability diagrams. In the latter field
boundaries mark the transformation of one or more phases into other quite
different ones as a result of chemical reactions. Also, when curved, the configurations of mineral phase boundaries
are usually attributable to effects such as the entropy and/or heat of
transformation. In contrast, plant species do not simply transform into other
species at stability field boundaries, although this may occur as part of far
more complex processes. In any case, the forms of plant stability fields, as
previously deduced, are likely to be related to stress factors acting on
individual species. 

<p> It may be
helpful to point out that although perfect equilibrium of a community such as
marked, for example, by C in the figures, requires that variables of state like
pH or moisture content have precisely the values shown, small deviations about
these values may occur without visible
change of inventoried species. It is likely that all observations of actual
inferred equilibrium communities are, at best, of this type.

<p> Complexities
inherent in stability field analysis may play important roles in the
interpretation of plant communities. As previously noted, the occurrence of
metastable species and communities appear to be common in nature. I  (Mueller,
1998)  called attention to species planted outside their primary stability
ranges. In nature also, a plant may seed itself or otherwise become established
at locations which do not satisfy the requirements of its entire life cycle,
including reproduction. Such plants may indeed flourish for a time and even
produce a few offspring, but then languish and die after they exceed available
living space or local living conditions. Seedlings may take root in soil that
overlies chemically incompatible horizons and so perish in a season or linger
for years. An example of induced incompatibility as represented by the effects
of a forest fire has already been given. Another possible example noted by the
writer was a mature but stunted and unhealthy-appearing Red Maple growing on a
chert talus slope that is underlain by limestone. As also observed earlier (
Mueller, 1998),  stable, established plants such as Hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>) may, by their influence on
soil over time by foliage drop, destabilize other species in the vicinity. The
effect of plant toxins such as those produced by Black Walnut are well known (
Fowells, 1965).  Familiarity with stability field analysis enables the observer
to rapidly assess the potential for such relations in the field. Genetic
variability however introduces less obvious effects, as for example, when an
ecotype of a species invades terrain unusual for that species. 

<p> Diagrams
such as Figures 1 and 2 may also aid in the interpretation of the relative
abundance of individuals of a species in the canopy of a given stand of trees.
In general it might be expected that the number of individuals of a species
might be relatively low, as at position C in the figures, where a number of other
species are stable. In contrast, stability field positions that fall in extreme
arboreal ranges, as those of Red Maple and White Ash in proximity to the water
saturation limit and Chestnut Oak at its dry soil limit, would be expected to
have but few species in a stand. An extreme example is the tropical forest, in
which so many species are stable that the densities of all species are low. These examples are
quite obvious, but many other, more subtle relations of the sort, might be
cited. A corollary of these relations is that the number of individuals of a
given species in a stand is not necessarily indicative of its relative
stability. An example of a species that shows this type of behavior in a number of forest types is
White Ash. Low densities of certain species may result from competition or a
variety of events or processes, and not at all from instability with respect to
substrate or climate, although such factors as light character may be involved.

<h3>Additional Applications and Summary</h3>

<ul>

<p> Stability
field analysis serves as the basis for a number of ecological investigations in
forests. It provides baseline standards of forest type and species occurrences
for studies of disturbances and succession and is mandatory for a comprehensive
interpretation of forest stands. 

<p> Stands of
trees, recognized as such, frequently number in the hundreds of canopy
individuals and extend over several to many acres of terrain with greatly
varying topography, substrate and even microclimate. In many investigations terrain
showing conspicuous variation of this type is avoided, or if not conspicuous,
the variation may be disregarded. However, to see most clearly the effect of
substrate, topography and microclimate on forest type and species
distributions, it is desirable to observe as broad a range of conditions and
habitats as possible. To date few examples of such comprehensive studies exist
in the literature. One of the most informative and generally superior of such
studies, even after the long lapse of time since its execution, is Braun's (
1950)  <i>Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America</i>. Of particular utility
are the extensive tabulations of stand compositions from her mixed mesophite
and western mesophite regions, since these regions encompass great variations
in geology and topography and thus capture the most striking examples of floral response.

<p> Braun's
study sites were selected with such great care that even stand scale data
reflect the strong relations between vegetation and substrate, However, close
examination also enables one to discern a number of microhabitat influences in
these data as well. Most of the stands she tabulated were located on rugged
slopes or in ravines of the Cumberland Plateau or similar highly dissected
areas to the west, where two very dissimilar rock types, limestone and
sandstone, are frequently juxtaposed. Trees that stand out as indicator species
are Red Maple, Beech, Chestnut Oak  (all acidiphile)  and Chinquapin Oak
(calciphile).  Her studies show the incompatibility of Beech and limestone
substrate as exemplified by the Inner Bluegrass region of Kentucky and the
limestone terrain of the Knobs Border region. The mutual antipathy of
Chinquapin Oak and Beech, Red Maple and Chestnut Oak in the Tennessee Cliff
Section of the mixed mesophyte region is displayed in her Table 18. Other
examples of such exclusions could be cited. However, her data also contain more
ambiguous but still interesting examples in her tables 19, 21, 22, 25. 27 and
29, which represent large stands, all rich in Beech,with small quantities of
Chinquapin Oak. It is likely that this apparent contradiction results from
isolated patches of calcareous terrain, perhaps in the form of limestone
outcrops. As we have seen, Chinquapin Oak appears to be virtually confined to such
sites, which might be expected to have only scattered occurrences in the deep
mull soils of the colluvial slopes and ravines she inventoried. A similar
example is found in a variety of unusual calcareous communities inventoried by
the Virginia Natural Heritage Program  (Fleming, 1999).  In their 400 square
meter study plots, acidiphile species occasionally were recorded in dominantly
calciphile communities, and soil pH showed variation in the plots as well.
These examples illustrate a general problem with inventories of large stands or
study plots considered as units even when the inventories are of the high
quality as these are. The same caution also applies to bryophytes and fungi,
all of which can, in stand scale inventories, give rise to contradictions that
may be resolved by considering microhabitats. In such inventories communities
do not correspond to equilibrium points but to areas  (really volumes in
multidimensional space). 

<p> There is
also a parallel between the ranges of species and their local occurrence and
microhabitats. Species that ascend highest in mountains generally range
farthest north. More subtly, species which are associated with alkaline or
calcareous sites in the east, are more likely to range farthest west  (Fowells,
1965)  since there is a general increase in alkalinity from east to west. The
latter effect is however complicated by a parallel decrease in moisture which
also restricts some species. There are of course contradictions to these
trends, in particular with respect to elevational effects. There is a
considerable number of plants that ascend to high elevations, but do not range
far north. It is possible that these are ecotypes and may be responding to
light intensity or other factors.

<p> Most
investigations in forest ecology appear to be conducted on a stand scale. In
some cases, such as dendroecological studies, this is mandatory, since at a
minimum only stands can provide the range of species and tree ages required.
However, there are many investigations which have, at least by implication, as
their major objectives stability relations, and here, as indicated in the
examples cited above, the stand scale is too coarse to discern many processes
at work. Frequently data from different stands of a forest type are combined,
and only average values presented. In some cases important soil indicators such
as pH or chemical concentrations are handled in this way even when the combined
stands occur on substrates ranging from siliceous to calcareous. The existence
of valuable data of this type may be mentioned but not presented. In the
resulting statistical analysis of many studies, correlations are sought from
combined data instead of recording actual observable correlations between
species individuals and specific substrate locations. In many studies much
attention is also given to precise determinations of the number of individuals
of saplings, seedlings and herbaceous species in a stand without any
discernable purpose. As previously mentioned, by analogy with mineral systems,
numbers of individuals may not be nearly as significant as the presence,
absence or locations of the species in question when stability is a
consideration. In any case, arbitrarily distinguishing &quot;seedlings&quot;
from &quot;saplings&quot; solely by size, as is conventional, is likely to be
meaningless. An example of an interesting and productive type of observation
was that of Carr  (1939)  who noted that in the Magnolia Swamp of Augusta
County, Virginia,  acid – loving species were rooted on hummocks of humus,
whereas calciphiles had their roots in positions that were in contact with
upwelling groundwater. In each case, soil associated with calciphiles had
pH=7.0, while soil associated with acidiphiles ranged between pH= 4.0 and 5.0.
In calling attention to this observation,  Fleming  (1999)  cited possible
similar relations in another wetland. The writer has also observed such
microhabitats in wetlands as indicated by juxtaposed contrasting flora and they
are very prevalent in upland forests, where they may be induced by vertical acid
leaching,  proximity to contrasting strata or other effects. In some instances
a variation in pH of almost two units over a distance of a meter have been
observed. An interesting situation arises when,  as on some alluvial deposits,
there is an intimate mix of a variety of rock types, in particular, sandstones
and limestones, and which, as observed by the writer, have given rise to
closely juxtaposed acidiphile and calciphile plants. It has been shown (
Korner,1999)  that plant roots will concentrate in soil volumes favoring
growth, such as those artificially fertilized, and it appears reasonable that
in rock mixtures each plant might seek out with its roots the rock or soil
appropriate to its species. To summarize, the most ecologically significant data
bearing on stability of species and forest types may be obtained from
microhabitats and observation of the widest possible range of habitats and
occurrences of species.

<p> It also
seems necessary to revisit the concept of the climax forest in relation to types
of climax defined in the current literature.  While relatively stable old
growth mixed mesophyte forest is universally regarded as a &quot;climatic&quot;
climax in the Appalachians, dry oak forest of ridges and a variety of other
forest types may be regarded as either &quot;physiographic&quot; or
&quot;edaphic&quot; climaxes. It is curious that the inherent contradiction in
this terminology does not seem to have been widely recognized. This
contradiction may be seen by considering that the mixed mesophyte forest type
is a product of rich colluvial slopes and ravines as well as a humid climate,
whereas the so-called physiographic or edaphic climax is the result of other
topographic and substrate conditions under a similar or somewhat different
climate. However since there are many gradations between all these forest
types, we have no <i>a priori</i> reason to believe that one or the other is
more or less a product of either climate, topography or substrate. As I
concluded earlier  (Mueller,1998),  all three as well as biologic factors
contribute not only to the climax stage but to all forests at every stage of
development.

<p> In addition
to introducing a new perspective, stability field analysis creates greatly
expanded opportunities for research, particularly in field classification of
species and forest types, but also in the detailed correlation of chemical, physical and climatic data with
species distributions. Although its application is here limited to the Central
Appalachian forests, the generality of its approach indicates that it should be
applicable to forest and terrestrial ecosystems everywhere.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>


<p> (1)  pH is defined as the negative logarithm  (base 10)  of
the activity of the hydrogen ion. The activity is related to the hydrogen ion
concentration  (equivalents per liter)  and in its simplest form, is equal to
the concentration.



<p> (2)  The reader may review the general criteria of
equilibrium, which are applicable to both thermodynamic and non-thermodynamic
equilibria.



<p> (3)  These authors have generally combined several soil
samples as representative of a site. While this appears to yield useful data in
the acid range, it can lead to contradictions for calcareous soils in which, 
in the experience of the writer, great variation in pH can occur over short
distances.
