<h2>Stony Creek Watershed</h2>
<p><b>Giles County, Virginia<br>December 1999</b> <p>
<blockquote>


<p><b>General</b>
<ul>

<p> The long Valley of Potts Creek that
extends southwest from the Covington, Virginia is flanked on the southeast by
Potts Mountain and on the northwest by Peters Mountain. Hemmed in by gorges in its lower reaches,
this branch of the James River flows in an increasingly open valley upstream
where it passes through a part of West Virginia. This openness between the ramparts of the great linear ridges
creates an impression of expansive skies reminiscent of western landscapes, and
highlighted, as on some of our visits, by autumn colors, possesses a scenic
grandeur unsurpassed in its type. 
Farther southwest the headwaters of this stream descend from the eastern
continental divide and the road, still on the Valley bottom, crosses from
Monroe County, West Virginia into Giles County, Virginia and the Stony Creek
Watershed of the New River drainage.
<p> While only one of many so-named in
these mountains, Stony Creek lives up to its name. It well reflects the regional geology which is dominated by
resistant Silurian and Devonian sandstones and quartzites that cap the ridges
and extend down steep valley sides.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Far different are the soft, mostly Devonian
shales of some valley floors and the Ordovician limestones and dolomites of the
northwest slope of Peters Mountain (out of the watershed) as well as scattered
locations in the watershed. Peters
Mountain retains its linear form far to the southwest, even beyond the New
River Narrows watergap, where it changes its name to East River Mountain. However, Potts Mountain broadens into
several shorter ranges such as Salt Pond Mountain and a plateau-like highland
which contains Mountain Lake, one of only two natural lakes in Virginia. Here also is one of the largest federal
wilderness areas in the region, the Mountain Lake Wilderness. Another wilderness area, the Peters
Mountain, is nearby. Both wilderness
areas, and much of the Stony Creek watershed, lie in the Jefferson National
Forest.</sup>
<p> Elevations in the Stony Creek
Watershed range from 1600 ft. (490 meters) to over 4000 ft (1200 meters)
asl. While erosion-resistant sandstones
and quartzites such as the Tuscarora, Keefer, Rocky Gap and Rose Hill hold up
the mountains, many rocks and soils of the slopes are not in place but are
colluvial boulder, talus, debris train and block field deposits (Rader <i>et al</i>, 1986). On such slopes drainage, moisture and nutrient availability may
be difficult to assess or predict.
<p> The dominant forest type of the
watershed is the dry ericaceous oak forest which is developed on acidic
siliceous rocks. The woody component of
this forest was studied in some detail by Adams and Stephenson, (1983) on the
southeast slope of Peters Mountain. It
is characterized by steady rises in importance values with elevation of
Northern Red and White Oaks with corresponding decreases in the importance of
Chestnut and Scarlet Oaks and Red Maple. 
These relations may also be observed along the Appalachian trail ascent
in the Peters Mountain Wilderness which exhibits typical Northern Red Oak
summit forest of “orchard” form trees. 
Here also, on 6-28-93 were noted a small tree and shrub layer with
Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana </i>),  still blooming Flame Azalea (<i>Rhododendron calendulaceum </i>),  Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia 
latifolia</i>)  and Minnie-bush
(<i>Menziesia pilosa </i>) and ground
cover of Galax (<i>Galax aphylla</i>) and Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>) as well as
Large Round-leaved Orchid (<i>Habenaria orbiculata 
</i>), also in bloom. This
flora, which is typical of the Stony Creek Watershed, marks a transitional belt
to the southern Appalachians. Such
boreal species as Canada Mayflower form communities with southern endemics like
Galax at high elevations and in valley
flats and wetlands. Here Galax is common at virtually all elevations,but
this abundance falls off rapidly to the north, and the species is scarce and
virtually excluded from high elevations north of the James River. Of special interest in the watershed is the
occurrence of American Holly (<i>Ilex opaca)  </i> at elevations
exceeding 2400 ft (730 meters) asl. It
is likely that this occurrence signals migration along the New River drainage
and may be an ecotype adaptation to cooler conditions here.
<p> Stony Creek tributaries lie in
dominantly siliceous and hence acid drainages. 
However this trend is presumably moderated on the mainstem, especially
in its lower reaches, which are under the influence of more carbonates. As part of the Ohio System the stream is
habitat for the large aquatic salamander, the Hellbender (<i>Cryptobranchus alleganiensis</i>).  Another inhabitant is
the increasingly rare fish, the Candy Darter (<i>Etheostoma osburni </i>).  
A further point of interest is the occurrence, just outside the
watershed, at the Narrows, of the only known colony of the Peters Mountain
Mallow (<i>Iliamna corei </i>).   Even the
cursory nature of the investigations reported here hint at a wealth of rare
species and unusual communities yet to be discovered in the region.

<p><b>Peters Mountain Wilderness</b>

<br><b>Source Walks: 6-28-93 and 5-12-98</b>
<ul>
<p>Each
of our traverses began at the Route 635 parking lot at an elevation of 2375
feet (724 m) on the Stony Creek bottom.That of 6-28-93 was rapid and the
inventory cursory, but it extended along the Appalachian Trail to near the
Peters Mountain summit at perhaps 3800 feet (1159 m) asl. Our inventory along
the same trail on 5-12-98 was much more thorough, but terminated at the 3000
ft. (915 m) level. An interesting feature noted on the latter date was the
retarded degree of advancement of leafing-out here when compared to that
observed on Little Stony Creek on the previous day (see <a href=giles.htm>our section on Little
Stony Creek</a>). This climatic feature was also reflected in the markedly cooler
temperature at other areas, such as Interior, along the base of Peters Mountain
at this time.
<p> The geology of the southeast slope
of Peters Mountain, the slope traversed by us, is dominated by Silurian
sandstones and quartzites of several formations, but also includes a little of
the Upper Ordovician Juneata Formation. The sequence of formations traversed
from bottom to top is, according to Rader <i>et
al </i> (1986)  as follows: 1)
colluvium, 2) Tonoloway,  3) Keefer, 4) Rose Hill, 5) Tuscarora, 6)  Juneata, 7
) colluvium, 8)  Rose Hill and 9)  Tuscarora, with the repetition indicating a
rather complex structure.
<p> In what follows the observed species
and terrain features are listed in the order in which they were
encountered on our 5-12-98 traverse. As
is conventional, both common and scientific names of less familiar species are
given on first mention but, with few exceptions,only common names thereater.
<p> The canopy at the trailhead
consisted of Tuliptree, Red Maple, Black and White Oaks and scattered Canada
Hemlock apparently free of the Adelgid. Sourwood (<i>Oxydendrum arboreum</i>)  and Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus 
florida</i>)  constituted an
understory and Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana </i>),  Buffalonut (<i>Pyrularia pubera</i>),  Upland Low Blueberry (<i>
Vaccinium pallidum</i>)  and Deer Berry (<i>V. stamineum</i>)  shrub layers. Summer Grape (<i>Vitis 
aestivalis</i>)  was the only
vine seen. The soil in this low elevation upland forest was a stony mor. Measurements yielded a pH in the range of
3.7 to 5.0.
<p> The ground flora in this acid forest
was dominated by Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria
procumbens </i>)  and Galax (<i>Galax 
aphylla</i>)  was common. Other
herbs were Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata</i>),  Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca obtusa</i>),  Heartleaf (<i>Hexastylis
virginica</i>),  White Wood Aster (<i>Aster 
divaricatus</i>),  Curtis
Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii </i>), Halberd-leaf Violet (<i>Viola hastata</i>)  in bloom and Squaw Root (<i>Conopholis americana </i>). Next seen in our progress were Cucumbertree (<i>Magnolia 
acuminata </i>), Striped Maple (
<i>Acer 
pensylvanicum </i>),  Common
Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia</i>),  Bushy Panic grass (<i>Panicum dichotomum</i>),  Yellow Stargrass (<i>Hypoxis hirsuta</i>),  Trailing Arbutus (<i>Epigaea
repens</i>),  Four-leaved Milkweed (<i>Asclepias 
quadrifolia</i>)  and Golden
Ragwort (<i>Senecio aureus</i>)  in bloom.Here three male Scarlet Tanagers (<i>Piranga 
olivacea </i>)  were observed at
the same time.
<p> Continuing onward, we saw the Tick
Trefoil <i>Desmodium glutinosum</i>, Plume Lily (<i>Smilacina 
racemosa </i>), Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola blanda</i>),  Variable Panic Grass (<i>Panicum commutatum</i>),  Round-leaf Pyrola (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia </i>), the fungus <i>Urnula
craterium</i>, somewhat stunted Mountain Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia compressa</i>)  and Palmate-leaf Violet (<i>Viola 
palmata</i>). 
<p> We now entered an area of abundant
Red Maple seedlings, Gall-of-the-Earth (<i>Prenanthes </i>sp),  saw the only Spotted Wintergreen (
<i>Chimaphila maculata</i>) of the traverse
and noted that Delicate Fern Moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>) appeared to be dominent
among the large mosses.Also seen here were Wild Lily of the Valley (<i>Convallaria montana </i>), a
Clintonia  (likely the white-flowered <i>C.
umbellulata </i>) scattered small sprouts of American Chestnut
(<i>Castanea dentata</i>), abundant Rattlesnake Weed (<i>Hieracium venosum </i>), Entire-leaved Yellow Foxglove (<i>Aureolaria 
laevigata </i>) and a few
stunted Christmas Ferns (<i>
Polystichum acrostichoides</i>). Here Black and Scarlet Oaks appeared to
increase in frequency and were accompanied by scattered Hemlock.Then, as the
trail approached more closely to the local stream, we saw the first Indian
Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana </i>) and heard the calls of a Phoebe (<i>Saornis phoebe </i>) and a Red-eyed Vireo (<i>Vireo 
olivaceus </i>). Also appearing
here were New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis </i>), Wild Geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>) in bloom, Wood Tickseed (<i>Coreopsis 
major</i>)  and the first Great
Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum </i>).These were followed by the vegetative remains of Wood
Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquefolia </i>),  a single small American Holly (<i>Ilex opaca </i>),  then the first-noted Black Birch, Wild
Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>),  Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum
lanuginosum</i>) and on approaching near the stream, American Spikenard (<i>Aralia 
racemosa</i>),  a single plant
of Lovage (<i>Ligusticum canadense</i>) and a Black Vulture (<i>Caragyps 
atratus </i>) soaring above the
trees.As we advanced along the stream Great Rhododendron and Hemlock became
more abundant.Associated species included Northern Red Oak, Great Chickweed (<i>Stellaria 
pubera</i>),  White Clintonia and on rocks,Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium 
virginianum </i>). Of interest
here was the occurrence of Downy Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum pubescens </i>)  rather than the common <i>P.</i> <i>biflorum</i>.  Here also we saw Virginia Creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolius</i>)  and a
Black and White Warbler (<i>Mniotilta varia</i>).  <i>Dicranum</i> moss was conspicuous on rocks and was
accompanied by Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia </i>).Not far beyond these we encountered Interrupted Fern (<i>Osmunda 
claytoniana </i>), 
Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>
),  the sedge <i>Carex appalachica</i>, an
inch-long blister beetle, Carrion Flower (<i>
Smilax herbacea </i>), the fungus <i>Polyporus badius</i> and Mountain Bellwort (<i>Uvularia pudica </i>).
<p> We had now reached the vicinity of a
trail-side shelter building  (illegal in this designated wilderness?),  beyond
which we tallied Tall Agrimony (<i>Agrimonia gryposepala </i>), Chestnut Oak and Pignut Hickory seedlings, Tuliptree,
American Chestnut sprouts and Common Speedwell (<i>Veronica officinalis </i>).
<p> In our passage thus far Teaberry had
been an almost constant component of the ground flora.Here it was joined by
Pussytoes, probably the Plantain-leaf species (<i>Antennaria plantaginifolia</i>). Still following the stream, the trail
again passed through vigrous Great Rhododendron with Mountain Bellwort,
Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla</i> <i>simplex/canadensis</i>),  Witch Hazel and the first-noted mature
Chestnut Oak. Here also we were diverted by a Black-throated Blue Warbler (<i>Dendroica 
caerulescens</i>), and
unexpectedly, by Southern Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium erythrocarpum</i>). 
<p> At this point the trail diverged to
the left, away from the stream, while <i>Polytrichum</i>,
<i>Atrichum 
</i>and <i>Leucobryum</i> mosses occupied the trail bank and blooming
Flame Azalea (<i>Rhododendron calendulaceum </i>)  was visible nearby. Here also we saw the first Downy
Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens
</i>), followed by Whorled Loosestrife
(<i>Lyssimachia quadrifolia </i>),a
little Wrinkled-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa</i>)  and heard the song of an Ovenbird (<i>Seiurus aurocapillus</i>). Next seen was a small Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana </i>), more Creeping Five-leaf, then Bowmans Root (<i>Gillenia t rifoliata </i>) and Hairy Woodmint (<i>Blephilla 
hirsuta </i>).Now the trail
turned sharply right and there was a distinct change to a richer, perhaps less
acid, terrain, as indicated by the occurrence of Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga 
racemosa </i>),a single Spice
Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>), a stunted Horse Balm (<i>Collinsonia canadensis </i>)  and Hairy Hawkweed (<i>Hieracium gronovii</i>). Although
Teaberry was not present here,Galax continued to be and was joined by Deer Berry. Also noted was the first mature Hickory seen, and in this case identified as
Pignut (<i>Carya glabra</i>). It is likely that this change in the flora resulted
from the presence of an underlying rock type richer in nutrients than that
previously traversed.



<p> As we approached the stream again,
Teaberry reappeared, accompanied by Late Purple Aster (<i>Aster patens</i>), 
Plantain-leaf Pussytoes (<i>Antennaria plantaginifolia </i>), here in bloom, and a Black-throated Blue Warbler (<i>Dendroica 
caerulescens</i>). Near the
stream Great Rhododendron again dominated the shrub layer under a canopy of
Tuliptree,Red Maple and Hemlock, with Round-leaf Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia </i>) and White Clintonia, with the latter in
full bloom.Keeping to the vicinity of the stream, the trail passed through a
succession of more and less acidic communities that included the first-noted
Wood Nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis </i>),Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense</i>), here also in bloom near Great Rhododendron and abundant Witch
Hazel,  then New York and Christmas Ferns,Sweet White Violet,<i>Hypnum</i> 
moss, Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum acerifolium </i>),considerable American Basswood, Northern Red Oak,Big-leaf
Aster (<i>Aster macrophyllus </i>),more
Wild Sarsaparilla and Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis</i>). The
Golden Alexanders (<i>Zizia t rifoliata </i>), which had appeared at intervals along
the trail, was here joined by Hairy Disporum, <i>Medeola</i> and again abundant
Wood Nettle.Following this there was an increase in Red Maple and Black Birch
and the only Mountain Maple (<i>Acer spicatum </i>) seen on our traverse. Still keeping to the stream, Black
Birch remained prominent and was joined by vigerous shrubs of Smooth Gooseberry
(<i>Ribes 
rotundifolium </i>) and Red
Elderberry (<i>Sambucus pubens </i>), here with Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea arborescens </i> and
Smooth Yellow Violet (<i>Viola pensylvanica</i>). 
<p> We had now entered an area of
numerous very straight and tall young Tuliptrees with a dense undergrowth of
Great Rhododendron, while on the trail bank grew <i>Medeola</i>, Wild Sarsaparilla,Downy Wood Violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>) and
Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>). American Basswood was also frequent here,while smaller fauna and
flora included an inch-broad living land snail, a bright yellow<i>Tremella 
</i>fungus, Apple Moss (<i>Bartramia pomiformis</i>)  and the moss <i>Aulocomnium heterostichum</i>..In our final observation
we noted the forest grass<i>
Brachyelytrum erectum </i> as we arrived at the stream crossing at an
elevation of near 3000 feet  (915 m) and terminated our May 1998 traverse.
<p> Our traverse of 6-28-93 documented
an increase in Chestnut and Scarlet Oaks, especially on convexities above 3000
feet asl. However at the highest elevations of the ridge summit these species
were largely replaced by Northern Red Oak and, to a lesser degree,by White Oak,
although some stunted Chestnut Oak and Black Gum were seen as well.Other
species noted near the summit were still-blooming Flame Azalea,Mountain Holly,
Mountain Laurel and blueberries of unrecorded species.The summit oaks had
typical &quot;orchard&quot;forms and numerous Northern Red Oak seedlings formed
the dominant ground cover in many places. Herbs included Canada Mayflower, Fly
Poison (<i>Amiantheum</i> <i>muscaetoxicum</i>)  in bloom, blooming Showy Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria serrata</i>),  
and a beautiful plant of Large Round-leaved Orchid (<i>Habenaria 
orbiculata </i>),  also in full
bloom. Ovenbird calls were common during this ascent as well.

<p><b>Wetlands at Interior</b>
<br> <b>Source Walk: 9-22-96, clear, cool</b>
<ul>
<p> Just east of Interior, Virginia,
close by Stony Creek and Route 635, drainage from Big Mountain results in small
streams and seeps and associated wetland communities. The Appalachian Trail lies less than a thousand feet (300 meters)
to the west. Elevation at the wetlands
is about 2400 ft (730 meters) asl and the general aspect is almost north. The substrate here is of colluvial origin
from big Mountain as previously described (Rader <i>et al</i>, 1986).
<p> The regional forest in the vicinity
of the wetlands ranges in age from young to mature, with a canopy of Northern
Red and White Oaks, Black Gum, Sassafras, White and Pitch Pines, Hemlock, Black
Cherry and Tuliptree. Sourwood (<i>Oxydendrum 
arboreum</i>)  and American
Holly (<i>Ilex opaca</i>),  the latter
to 20 ft. (6 meters) or more, occur as understory while Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum </i>),  Witch
Hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana </i>) and Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia 
latifolia</i>)  dominate the
shrub layer. Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella 
repens</i>),  Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria 
procumbens </i>),  Trailing
Arbutus (<i>Epigæa repens </i>),  Spotted Wintergreen (<i>Chimaphila 
maculata </i>),  Heartleaf (<i>Hexastylis 
virginicum</i>) and Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium
 labelliforme</i>)  form a ground cover. In some places, as near or under
Rhododendron, there is abundant Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum canadense </i>). 
<p> One of the wetlands is associated
with a small stream that weaves its way under overhanging Canada Hemlock, Black
Gum, Red Maple and White Ash and tall shrubs that include Great Rhododendron,
Witch Hazel, Smooth Alder (<i>Alnus serrulata 
</i>), Silky Dogwood (<i>Cornus amomum 
</i>), Winterberry Holly (<i>Ilex verticillata</i>),  American Holly, Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis </i>) and a little Spice Bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>).  A little Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana</i>)  occurs on
the bank which borders the stream’s narrow boggy floodplain. On this boggy flat Ground Berry (<i>Rubus hispidus </i>) forms a
cover with various herbs. Shining
Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium lucidulum 
</i>), Ground Pine, New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris
 noveboracensis </i>),  Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea </i>),  Sensitive Fern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis </i>),  the rarer Crested Fern (<i>Dryopteris</i> <i>cristata</i>)  and Common Horsetail (<i>Equisetum</i> <i>arvense </i>) represent non-flowering plants; <i>Scirpus</i>
<i>polyphyllus</i>, <i>Carex</i> <i>intumescens</i>, <i>C</i>. <i>gynandra</i>,
<i>C</i>. <i>lurida</i>, <i>C</i>. <i>debilis</i>, the sedges, and
<i>Juncus effusus</i> and <i>J</i>. <i>tenuis </i>the rushes. Among widespread grasses
such as Autumn Bent (<i>Agrostis perennans</i>)  and the mannas (<i>Glyceria melicaria</i> and <i>G. striata </i>) tall clumps of the disjunct northerner
Drooping Wood Reedgrass (<i>Cinna latifolia </i>) stood out. Bush Panic Grass (<i>Panicum dichotomum 
</i>) and the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum
 erectum</i> formed scattered clumps on the dryer periphery which they shared
with Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex 
</i>) Sessile-leaved Bellwort (<i>Uvularia sessilifolia) </i>, Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana </i>),  Whorled
Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia quadrifolia</i>)  and a little Painted Trillium (<i>Trillium undulatum</i>).  
Adding diversity to wetter areas were Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>),  Northern Bugleweed (<i>Lycopus uniflorus </i>),  Mad-dog Skullcap (<i>Scutellaria l ateriflora</i>), 
Wrinkleed-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago rugosa 
</i>), Tear Thumb Vine (<i>Polygonum sagittatum 
</i>), Northern White Violet (<i>Viola
 pallens </i>),  Roundleaf Violet (<i>Viola
 rotundifolia</i>),  Virgin’s Bower (<i>Clematis virginiana </i>),  Cowbane
(<i>Oxypolis rigidior </i>),  Crooked
Stem Aster (<i>Aster prenanthoides</i>),  Kidneyleaf Grass of Parnassus (<i>Parnassia asarifolia) </i>,
Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens</i> sp.)
and Small Green Wood Orchid (<i>Habenarica clavellata 
</i>).
<p> Immediately upstream from this plant
community the stream flows through heavier woodland with much large woody
debris. Here there is a copious growth
of diverse mosses and liverworts including species of <i>Sphagnum</i>, <i>Mnium</i>, <i>Dicranum</i> and <i>Fissidens</i>, <i>Thuidium delicatum</i>, <i>Atrichum crispum</i> and <i>Bazzania</i>. 
<p> Incidental signs of fauna observed
in this wetland were large Crayfish castings, colorful solitary bees, a Meadow
Vole (likely <i>Microtus pennsylvanicus </i>) and a Red-spotted Purple Butterfly (<i>Limenitis arthemis</i>, <i>astyanax</i>). 
<p> The second wetland, a seep, lies
just to the east of the first. This
wetland is more open and made conspicuous by its stands of large Cinnamon
Ferns. It is recommended as a Special
Interest Area, Biological, by the Virginia Natural Heritage Program. Although it is quite open, it is rich in
shrubs, including Smooth Alder<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></sup>,
Glade St. Johnswort (<i>Hypericum densiflorum 
</i>), Mountain Laurel, Maleberry (<i>Lyonia
 ligustrina </i>),  Southern Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium erthrocarpum </i>),  Highbush Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium corymbosum </i>),  Red Chokeberry (<i>Aronia arbutifolia </i>),  Wild Raisin (<i>Viburnum cassinoides </i>),  Hardhack (<i>Spiræa tomentosa</i>),  Witch
Hazel, Silky Dogwood, Winterberry and American Hollys. Tall Pitch Pines and other trees border the
seep area. Curiously, a single Virginia
Juniper (<i>Juniperus virginiana 
</i>) also grew here, but near the road, and possibly under its
influence. Where the boggy surface is
more open to the sky it is largely covered by <i>Sphagnum moss </i>and Ground Berry. Trailing Arbutus and Roundleaf Pyrola (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia</i>)  occupy
hummocks under shrubs.</sup>
<p> Three plants that were conspicuous
over the open bog were Tawny Cotton Sedge (<i>Eriophorum
 virginicum</i>),  tall Bushy Bluestem grass (<i>Andropogon glomeratus </i>) and
Nodding Lady’s Tresses (<i>Spiranthes cernua 
</i>), with the latter electrifying the openings with its evenly spaced
spikes of white blooms. But perhaps the
greatest botanical interest here is in two disjunct clubmosses, <i>Lycopodium alopecuroides</i>, a coastal plain species, and Bog Clubmoss (<i>L. inundatum </i>),  a native of boreal bogs. 
Both species occur as separate patches several square meters in area in
the open bog. Sedges and rushes found
here were <i>Carex lurida</i>, <i>C</i>. <i>intumescens</i>,
<i>Scirpus cyperinus</i>, the beakrush <i>Rhychospora
capitellata</i>, <i>Juncus subcaudatis</i>, <i>J. marginatus</i> and <i>J.
 effusus</i>;, as well as the grass <i>Panicum dichotomum</i> var <i>barbulatum.</i> While Turtlehead and Kidneyleaf Grass of Parnassus also occur, a
new assemblage of wetland herbs not observed in the more shaded first wetland
adds further interest. These are
Flat-Top White Aster (<i>Aster umbellatus</i>),  Calico Aster (<i>Aster lateriflorus 
</i>), Common Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium
 fistulosum </i>),  Boneset (<i>E.
perfoliatum</i>),  Hairy Thoroughwart (<i>E. rotundifolium</i>),  Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio aureus </i>),  Tasslerue (<i>Trautvetteria caroliniensis </i>),  Seedbox (<i>Ludwigia alternifolia 
</i>), Marsh St. Johnswort (<i>Hypericum
 virginicum </i>),  Canadian St. Johnswort (<i>H. canadense </i>),  Ridged Yellow Flax (<i>Linum striatum </i>),  Rough
Bedstraw (<i>Galium asprellum 
</i>), Yellow Fringed Orchid (<i>Habenaria
 ciliaris </i>) and Round-leaved Sundew (<i>Drosera rotundifolia </i>). 
<p> As in the first wetland, large
crayfish castings were abundant here. 
New faunal elements were swarms of non-biting gnats, a Pearl Crescent
Butterfly (<i>Phyciodes tharos 
</i>) and abundant bumblebees patronizing flowers in the sun.
<p> Clearly the environment of these two
inventoried wetlands is decidedly acidic, as is the enveloping upland
forest. Nutrient availability also
appears somewhat limited, although a fairly rich flora -especially of shrubs-
has developed. Those conditions are
likely the result of the large synclinal structure of Big Mountain which has
isolated the Ordovician limestones and perhaps even the Silurian Tonoloway
limestone from exposure in the colluvial deposits that form the substrate. However some rocks of intermediate nutrient
content such as the Devonian Huntersville Formation may have been accessed by
these deposits, accounting for such diversity as exists here.

<p><b>Interior / Cherokee Flats</b>
<br>
<b>Source walks: 5-11-98 and 5-12-98</b>
<ul>
<p> This location is very near-borders
on-the two Interior wetlands previously discussed. It includes particularily
the flat floodplain area of the south side of Stony Creek. Weather on the
evening of arrival (5-11-98) was extraordinarily cool compared to the that of
the Little Stony Creek Valley from which we had come, and the leafing-out was
retarded compared to that at the latter location.However the number of bird
calls, and especially of Wood Thrush in the evening, was striking. Some warming
occurred during the night however.No night birds were heard.
<p> The area of interest is dominated by
a canopy of tall White and Pitch Pines, Hemlock, Red Maple, Black Oak, Black
Birch, Beech, Black Gum, Tuliptree andWhite Oak, with an understory and shrub
layers of Sourwood, Serviceberry  (possibly both <i>Amelanchier arborea </i>and <i>A.laevis
</i>),  abundant Great Rhododendron,
American Holly and Mountain Laurel.A shrub of Black Haw Viburnum (<i>Viburnum 
prunifolium</i>) in full bloom near the road may have been influenced
by road gravel lime.The entire area is under an acid regime, in this area
acid-mesic and acid-hydric, and the ground flora reflects this. A dominent herb
under Rhododendron was Canada Mayflower
and there was an unusual occurrence, in a wet area of a springbrook under
Rhododendron, of Wild Lily of the Valley (<i>Convallaria
 montana </i>),  then in bloom.Other herbs noted were Wood Anemone (<i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>),  also in bloom, and <i>Kidne</i>y<i>tleaf Grass of Parnas</i>s<i>us.</i>
<p> On the morning of 5-12-98, birds of
many kinds were evident. These included Wood Thrush, Towhee, Red-eyed Vireo,
Northern Water Thrush (<i>Seiurus noveboracensis</i>)  and Blackburnian, Chestnut-sided,Black and White and Parula
Warblers (<i>Dendroica fusca</i>, <i>D. pensylvanica</i>, <i>Mniotilta varia 
</i>and <i>Parula americana</i>)..   An aggressive Spring Peeper called loudly nearby as we observed
the Northern Water Thrush.
<p> 5-12-98 was also trout stocking day
with fishermen following the truck!

</ul>
<p><b>North Fork of Stony Creek</b>
<br><b>Source Walk: 10-5-96: Clear, cool.</b>
<ul>
<p> The North Fork of Stony Creek lies
in a high valley between Fork and Peters Mountains and heads on the Monroe
County line. It may be reached by State
Route 613 and Forest Road 945 from Route
635 through a high wind gap in Fork Mountain. 
Silurian and Devonian sandstones dominate the terrain. However much of the North Fork valley is
underlain by unconsolidated colluvium consisting of sands, gravels and
talus. Elevations along the stream lie
between 2950 and 3000 ft (900 and 915 meters) asl.
<p> At the ford of FR 945 on the North
Fork there is a beautiful stand of mature Hemlock and White Pine but upstream Red Maple, White Oak and Black
Gum are more common on the bottomland. 
Understory trees include Smooth Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier lævis</i>)  and
abundant Mountain Holly.  Great Rhododendron is by far the most abundant shrub
but Mountain Laurel, Witch Hazel (in bloom) and Wild Raisin also occur. Groundberry is a common ground cover in
moist areas. Herbs are neither abundant
nor diverse but are concentrated in openings. 
They include Cinnamon, New York and Hay- scented Ferns and a little
Christmas Fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>) ; the sedges <i>Carex intumescens</i>, <i>C. baileyi</i>, <i>C. lurida</i>, <i>C. gynandra</i> and<i>Scirpus cyperinus</i>; the rushes <i>Juncus effusus</i> 
and <i>J. subcaudatis</i>, the grass <i>Panicum
 boscii</i>, Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola blanda </i>) and
Kidneyleaf Grass of Parnassus (in seed). 
In shaded, dryer areas there is a little Teaberry and Partridge
Berry. <i>Sphagnum </i>moss occurs in the
wettest areas but species of <i>Polytrichum</i>,
<i>Atrichum</i>, <i>Dicranum</i>, <i>Leucobryum</i> and <i>Hypnum</i> and <i>Thuidium
delicatulum</i> are all common,
especially under Hemlock. Associated
fungi were <i>Næmatoloma fasciculare</i>, <i>N</i>. <i>sublateritum</i> and species of <i>Russula</i>.. Birds observed
were Chickadees (<i>Parus </i>sp),  Juncos (<i>Junco hyemalis</i>),  Ravens (
<i>Corvus 
corax</i>) and Blue Jays (<i>Cyanocitta cristata</i>
), as well as unidentified callers. An
unidentified Angle Wing Butterfly was seen. 
Only water striders were observed in the stream, which however, was not
examined closely for aquatic life.
<p> After fording the stream,a traverse
was made to the northwest along Forest Route 1503, which lies at the base of
Peters Mountain and parallels the stream. 
The length of this traverse was about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) at elevations
ranging from 3100 ft to 3200 ft  (945
to 975 meters) asl. Along the first
half of the traverse the canopy appears to be dominated by Scarlet and Black
Oak with visible Black Oak seedlings. 
White and Northern Red Oaks are also important components, while Red
Maple, Black Gum, Pitch Pine and White Pine are subordinate. Only two Tuliptrees were seen.Canada Hemlock is common in the understory which
also contains American Chestnut sprouts, Sassafras, both <i>Amelanchier arborea</i> and <i>A. lævis</i> and abundant Mountain Holly.  Great Rhododendron dominates the
shrub layer but Mountain Laurel, Upland Low Blueberry,  and Black Huckleberry (<i>Gaylussacia baccata)  </i>also
occur. Only a few Striped Maple and
Chestnut Oak were seen.
<p> Although most of the traverse is
through dry forest, the presence of Great Rhododendron seems to point to ample
subsurface water and several small seeps and streamlets occur at
intervals. Herbs and ground cover in the
dry forest were the familiar Trailing Arbutus, Teaberry, Four-leaved Yam, 
Mountain Bellwort,  Mountain Oat Grass,  Rattlesnake Weed,  Whorled Loosestrife,
Hairy Angelica (<i>Angelica venenosa 
</i>), Galax, Tree Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium
 obscurum </i>),  Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum 
</i>), New York and Hay-scented Ferns. 
A single plant of Devils Bit (<i>Chamælirium
 luteum 
</i>) was seen. A constant
feature also, as at other high elevations in such forests at this season, was a
scattering of individual blooms of Soapwort Gentian (<i>Gentiana saponaria </i>).  
While mosses were not conspicuous here, the usual <i>Leucobryum</i> cushions at tree
bases were of common occurrence.
<p> In the few seeps which occur in this
section there are small colonies of Northern Bugleweed, Spikerush (<i>Eleocharis</i> sp.), Ridged Yellow Flax
and Clammy Hedge-hyssop (<i>Gratiola neglecta 
</i>), a little Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris marginalis </i>),  Cinnamon Fern and the haircap moss <i>Polytrichium commune</i>. Partridge
Berry occurs in more shaded spots. <i>Lactarius atroviridis</i> was an
identified fungus.
<p> Along the second part of the
traverse Northern Red Oak appeared to increase in the canopy and as seedlings,
although the other oaks also continued to be common. Here also, Cucumber Tree (<i>Magnolia
 acuminata</i>)  was noted for the first time, while Hemlock increased in the
understory. Great Rhododendron
continued to dominate the shrub layer. 
The several small streams that cross the road are marked by heavy growths
of Great Rhododendron and associated Turtlehead, Mountain Aster (<i>Aster acuminatus </i>),  Indian
Cucumber-root and Ground Pine. 
Round-leaf Pyrola, Wild Indigo (<i>Baptisia
t inctoria </i>) and Sweet Goldenrod (<i>Solidago odora</i>)  were added to
our herb tally in the dry forest. 
Macrolichens were moderatedly abundant here, with <i>Usnea</i> conspicuous on
Scarlet Oak and <i>Lobaria pulmonaria</i> on Red Maple. The lower
trunk and roots of a large White Oak supported a heavy cover of <i>Rhodobryum roseum</i> and other
mosses.
<p> After reaching the end of FR
1503,the traverse was extended southeast and downslope toward the stream,
passing through an area of small White Pine and hardwoods, perhaps marking a
former clearcut. Here, curiously, in
fairly deep shade, a large bush of Deer Berry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum </i>) favored us with its large green but
tasty berries. Beyond this point an
opening in the canopy over a dense tangle of Great Rhododendron and Winterberry
Holly revealed a beaver meadow studded by large standing and down snags. The meadow, perhaps several acres in area,
was rimmed by tall living Pitch Pines and brilliantly colored Red Maple. Below an old beaver dam the steam cut
through the meadow under vertical banks of white sand in an open bog. While most of the standing and down snags
appeared to be Hemlock, a 16 inch (41 cm) Chestnut Oak showed signs of Beaver
teeth.
<p> The dominant cover of the bog
surface was a dense mat of <i>Sphagnum</i> and Groundberry with subordinate but tall
haircap moss (<i>Polytrichum</i> sp.). Herbs were neither diverse nor abundant,
with scattered Hay-scented Fern, a likely white violet (<i>Viola</i> sp),  the Fireweed <i>Erechtities
 hieracifolia</i>, the sedges and rushes
<i>Scirpus cyperinus</i>, <i>Carex
gynandra</i>, <i>C. intumescens</i> and <i>Juncus
 subcaudatis</i>. Grasses were limited to a little Autumn Bent
and a few tall clumps of Rattlesnake Manna Grass (<i>Glyceria canadensis</i>.) Large conks of the fungus <i>Ganoderma t sugae </i>on dead Hemlock and an unusual moss, a species of <i>Neckera</i>, on down wood, added interest.
<p> Although not seen in this traverse,
the Virginia Natural Heritage program (
Erdlie <i>et al</i>, 1996)  reported an
occurrence of Bog Clubmoss in a beaver meadow in the area. They also identified two species of <i>Sphagnum</i>:, <i>S. quinquefarium </i> and <i>S. rubellum</i>.. However these could not be confirmed by us
given the available resources.
<p> Faunal sightings, sounds and signs
were sparse and little investigated during the traverse. Calls of Gray Squirrels (<i>Sciurus 
carolinensis </i>) were
heard. A Black-throated Blue Warbler (<i>Dendroica 
cærulescens</i>)  and a colorful
Angle-wing Butterfly were seen in the upland forest, but the beaver meadow bog
yielded only an Eft of the Eastern Newt (<i>Notophthalmus
 viridescens</i>) in a bog pool.
<p> Both the upland forest and the
Beaver meadow encountered on this traverse seem remarkable in terms of their
apparent soil acidity, lack of nutrients and resulting low biological
diversity. Ultimately these conditions
are likely to follow from the highly siliceous substrate which apparently
prevails in the area. Another feature
that should be noted is the low gradient of this valley below extensive high
mountain slopes. These conditions should
encourage the accumulation of cold air, especially during the early growing
season, creating conditions favorable for northern disjuncts such as the
reported Bog Clubmoss and the Rattlesnake Manna Grass seen by us.

<p><b>White Rocks Branch and Virginia Walk Trail</b>
<br><b>Source Walks: 7-4-92, 6-16-93 and 10-6-96</b>
<ul>
<p> This branch of Stony Creek rises on
the slopes of Little and Potts Mountains on the edge of the Mountain Lake
Wilderness. Colluvial deposits are
important here also, and it is likely that they contain carbonate components
contributed by the undifferentiated Ordovician Reedsville, Eggleston and
Moccasin Formations that are exposed upslope on Potts Mountain and thus can
exert their influence on the stream.nal 
<p> A wetland that lies along the stream
just northeast of the White Rocks Campground as well as the surrounding upland
forest provide interesting comparisons with the two areas discussed
previously. The wetland, which lies at
an elevation a little below 3000 ft (910 mters) asl, is crossed by the Virginia
Walk Trail which forms a closed loop through the upland forest to an elevation
of about 3100 ft (940 meters).
<p> The inventories that were done on
7-4-92 and 6-16-93 were very cursory compared to that done on 10-6-96 but
provided some seasonally significant information. Weather on all three occasions was seasonable. However that on 10-6-96 provided an opportunity
to note the effect of elevation. 
Temperatures here were markedly cooler than those experienced at the
Steel Bridge Campground at 1700 ft (520 meters) elevation on the same day.
<p> The upland forest that borders the
wetland on the south is secondary but mature, with a canopy dominated by
apparently Adelgid-free Hemlock. Codominants
are White, Northern Red and Chestnut Oaks, Black Gum, Tuliptree, Cucumber Tree,
Yellow and Black Birches, Red and Sugar Maples, White Pine and Black
Cherry. Mountain Holly is abundant in the understory, which also
contains Striped Maple, Serviceberry and Fire Cherry (<i>Prunus pensylvanica </i>).  
Great Rhododendron is abundant near the stream and Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia </i>) was the
only vine noted. Partridge Berry and
some Spotted Wintergreen occurred under Hemlock,where abundant Canada Mayflower
was also in evidence on the May and June visits. None of the latter was observed in October however, it presumably
having gone dormant by then. However at
that time large Sulfur-Shelf or Chicken of the Woods Fungi (<i>Polyporus sulphureus </i>) and
Honey Mushrooms (<i>Armillariella mellea 
</i>) were observed on large stumps in the area.
<p> The wetland along the stream is
shrub swamp for the most part, but there are grass and sedge covered
openings. Smooth Alder is the most
abundant shrub but Hardhack (<i>Spiraea
tomentosa</i>),  Winterberry Holly, Maleberry, Highbush Blueberry, Silky
Dogwood, Mountain Laurel and Spice Bush were also observed. Scattered Red Maple rise above the shrubs
and Canada Hemlock saplings intrude from the south. Tall Cinnamon and Royal (<i>Osmunda
 regalis </i>) Ferns are conspicuous, but New York, Christmas and Lady
Fern also occur. Where the shrub layer
is interrupted, as in places along the stream, sedges, rushes and grasses form
a heavy growth. Identified were <i>Carex lurida</i>, <i>C. gynandra</i>, <i>Scirpus polyphyllus</i> (with conspicuous vegetative reproduction),<i>S. cyperinus</i>,
<i>Juncus effusus</i>,<i>J. t enuis, </i>
the Spike Rush <i>Eleocharis obtusa</i>, the manna grasses <i>Glyceria striata</i> and <i>G. melicaria</i>, Deer-tongue Grass (<i>Panicum clandestinum </i>),  Bushy
Panic Grass (<i>P. dichotomum </i>),  Rice Cutgrass (<i>Leersia oryzoides </i>),  Autumn Bent Grass and Drooping Wood
Reedgrass. Scattered among these and in
more shaded areas were Tasslerue, Turtlehead, SpottedJewelweed (<i>Impatiens capensis </i>),  Northern
Bugleweed, Arrowleaf Tearthumb, Calico Aster, a Willow-herb (<i>Epilobium</i> sp.), New York Ironweed (<i>Vernonia noveboracensis </i>),  Small-flowered St. Johnswort (<i>Hypericum mutilum </i>),  Virgin’s
Bower, a Violet (<i>Viola</i> sp.),
Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod,Kidneyleaf Grass of Parnassus, Upright Yellow Wood
Sorrel (<i>Oxalis stricta </i>),  Rough
Bedstraw, False Pimpernel (<i>Lindernia dubia 
</i>), Tickseed (<i>Bidens autumnale 
</i>), Foam Flower (<i>Tiarella cordifolia</i>),  Square-stemmed
Monkey-flower (<i>Mimulus ringens</i> 
) and Tall Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum polygamum 
</i>). While <i>Sphagnum</i> moss is not common, some is associated with patches of Ground
Berry. Water Starwort (<i>Callitriche heterophylla </i>) and a <i>Fontinalis</i> moss occur in the stream, while other mosses, including species
of <i>Atrichum</i>, as well as thallus
liverworts, grow along the bank in moist spots.
<p> The impression here is of overall
floral richness, although many species,prominent early in the season but not
recorded in the first two visits, were probably dormant in October. This impression of richness extends to the
fauna as evidenced particularly in the May and June visits when Wood Ducks (<i>Aix sponsa </i>),  Red-Shouldered Hawks (<i>Buteo lineatus</i>),  Barred Owls, Scarlet Tanagers, Vireos, Wood Thrushes and a
male Diana Butterfly (<i>Speyeria diana 
</i>) as well as unidentified species, were recorded in the wetland and
the adjoining forest. Even on the cold
10-6-96 visit,birds, including migrant thrushes, Red-bellied Woodpeckers (<i>Melanerpes carolinus </i>) and a
number of unknowns, as well as abundant fish in the stream, attracted our
attention. Of particular interest on the October, 1996 visit were large white
woolly aphids on the Smooth Alder. 
These consisted of several forms, including large adults, whose
cone-shaped abdomens showed stripes of white wool, tiny immature forms on the
bodies of adults and winged forms. The
adults appeared to contain or excrete a highly staining purple fluid.
<p> After our wetland inventory a
clockwise traverse was made around the Virginia Walk Trail, which is of the
order of a mile (1.6 km) in length. The
first section of the trail follows along the base of Little Mountain up-valley
from the campground. The aspect here is
south and the canopy is dominated by Scarlet, Black, Northern Red and White
Oaks, with lesser amounts of Chestnut Oaks, Red Maple, Black Gum, Black Birch,
Black Locust, Tuliptree, Black Cherry, Pignut Hickory (including <i>Carya glabra </i>),  Cucumber Tree, and Pitch Pine. The understory consists of Downy Serviceberry, Striped Maple,
Flowering Dogwood, abundant Sourwood, Hemlock and American Chestnut
sprouts. There is also some Hawthorn (<i>Cratægus 
</i>) of undetermined species. 
Deer Berry, Mountain Laurel, Upland Low Blueberry, Witch Hazel, Great
Rhododendron, Maple-leaf Viburnum (<i>Viburnum
 acerifolium</i>),  Pasture Rose (<i>Rosa carolina </i>) and Blackberries (<i>Rubus </i>) of undetermined
species form a shrub layer. While not
abundant, herbs, a mix of acid-soil and generalist species, included Mountain
Oat Grass (mostly on the trail), Mountain Bellwort, Wood Tickseed (<i>Coreoposis major</i>),  Indian Pipe
(<i>Monotropa uniflora</i>),  Four-leaved
Yam, Indian Cucumber-root, Soapwort Gentian (in bloom), Galax, Common
Speedwell, Creeping Five-leaf, Cowbane (in seeps), Christmas, Cinnamon and
Hay-scented Ferns, Ebony Spleenwort (<i>Asplenium
 platyneuron </i>),  Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca
obtusa </i>),  the panic grass <i>Panicum boscii</i>,  the forest grass <i>Brachyelytrum
 erectum</i>, the woodrush <i>Luzula echinata</i>, Smooth-Forked Chickweed (<i>Paronchia canadensis </i>),  Wild Sage (<i>Salvia lyrata </i>),  Dotted St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum punctatum </i>) and
Sweet-scented Bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum) </i>. Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i> 
) and Hog Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata 
</i>) occur in a few richer soil areas. 
Fern Moss  (likely<i>Thuidium delicatulum </i>) seemed
to dominate the larger mosses, and the familiar red crustose lichens were
conspicuous on red oak group trees.
<p> On the second leg of the traverse
the trail turns south toward the stream. 
On approaching the stream the character of the forest changes
drastically with the canopy now dominated by Hemlock, Red Maple and Yellow and
Black Birches. Great Rhododendron is
the dominant shrub and the first and only Black Haw Viburnum (<i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>)  was
encountered. White Wood and
Crooked-stem Asters, Tall Cone Flower (<i>Rudbeckia
 laciniata </i>),  Turtlehead, Partridge Berry, <i>Glyceria melicaria</i>, Kidneyleaf Grass of Parnassus, and the remains
of Skunk Cabbage (<i>Symplocarpus foetidus 
</i>) occupied the black organic soil along the stream and beneath the
trees. Although time did not permit
close attention to them, a community of beautiful and luxuriant mosses occupied
the banks and environs of the stream crossing. 
In addition to unidentified species of <i>Sphagnum</i> and <i>Mnium</i> 
in moist areas, the stream also contained the <i>Fontinalis</i> reported
earlier.
<p> After leaving the stream area, the
trail climbs a gentle slope of northern aspect, but through an increasingly
ericaceous forest with abundant Galax, Teaberry, Rattlesnake Plantain and
Round-leaved Pyrola under Scarlet and Black Oaks. A characteristic noted here was the close resemblance in leaf
shape and bark of these two oaks which in some cases could be distinguished
only by carefully noting the character of the buds, leaf hair and texture.
<p> Presently, however, the trail
entered a region of rocky ravines with small rapidly flowing streams. Striped Maple became more abundant and an
unidentified Azalea (<i>Rhododendron</i> sp.)
and a <i>Clintonia</i> were noted. 
As the trail turned west a number of these ravines and streams were
crossed and the increasingly mesic forest on this northern aspect was
emphasized by the abundant Black and Yellow Birch, Red Maple and Tuliptree,
with Hemlock in the understory. White
Ash seedlings were abundant here as well. 
Among the ground cover were Marginal Shield Fern, Round-leaf and
Northern White Violets, Miterwort (<i>Mitella
 diphylla </i>) and Drooping Wood Reedgrass, while Water Hemlock (<i>Cicuta maculata </i>), 
Pennsylvania Bittercress (<i>Cardamine pensylvanica 
</i>) and Lettuce Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga
 micranthidifolia </i>) occupied the streams and adjacent
moist areas. Although not observed on
the 10-6-96 visit, presumably because it was dormant, White Hellebore (<i>Veratrum viride </i>) was prominent
in the vicinity of these streams on the earlier May and June visits. A survey of mosses and liverworts, which
thrive in these damp ravines, included <i>Mnium
 cuspidatum</i>, <i>M. hornum</i>, <i>Dicranum scorparium</i>, species of <i>Atrichum</i>,
<i>Polytrichum</i>, <i>Hypnum</i> and <i>Campylium</i>, <i>Porela platyphylloides</i> and <i>Bazzania
trilobata</i>..
<p> After passing through the area of
ravines the trail again leads through dry forest on a gentle westward-facing
slope. On this section, which
approaches the Campground at elevations near 3100 ft (945 meters) elevation,
there is an impression of increased abundance of Mountain Holly and Sourwood in
the understory.
<p> In the observed sequence of
environmental types both the White Rock wetland and the surrounding upland
forest appear to be the least acidic and most nutrient-rich. In this sequence the North Fork area
certainly qualifies as the most acid and nutrient-poor, while the Interior
wetlands area and associated upland forest seem to fall between the
others. Although elevational effects
appear to be present in the relative abundance of Mountain Holly and a few
other species at the three areas, the effect of cold air accumulation and the
bog environment in mimicking elevation is also shown by such northern
species as Canada Mayflower and Drooping Wood Reedgrass at the Interior wetland.
It is interesting to compare the latter
with species that occur at the Steel Bridge Campground (see <a href=potts.htm>our section on
Potts Mountain</a>), which is located on the valley flat along Potts Creek, also
beneath the high slopes of Peeters and Potts Mountains, but at an elevation 700
feet (214 m) lower than the Interior wetlands. No markedly boreal species
were found by us at Steel Bridge, where the south-ranging Wood Reedgrass (<i>Cinna arundiancea</i>) rather
than Drooping Wood Reedgrass occurs.
<p> Fungi collected on the 10-6-96
traverse and identified by R. Hunsucker were the following:

</ul>
<p><b>Return to White Rocks: 7-11-97, 7-12-97 and
7-13-9</b>
<ul>Here
we recount a breif inventory of the campground area and wetland, somewhat more
detailed ones for four sites along Forest Road 645 and State Route 613 and for
one site farther west along FR 734.
<p> A spot re- inventory of the upland
forest at Campsite 29 yielded Scarlet Oak, Northern Red Oak, Yellow Birch,
Sassafras, Canada Hemlock, White Oak, Black Locust, Black Birch, White Ash,
Black Cherry, Red Maple, Striped Maple, Great Rhododendron, Witch Hazel, Deer
Berry, abundant Canada Mayflower and a little Large Twayblade Orchid (<i>Liparis lilifolia</i>).  Rhododendron was in full bloom, as was
Groundberry (<i>Rubus</i> <i>hispidus</i>) in the wetland. The large
size of the latter's flowers seemed somewhat anomalous. Also noted for the
first time in the wetland were Velvet Grass (<i>Holcus lanatus</i>) and
Small-fruted Panic Grass (<i>Panicum microcarpon</i>).  A Wood Frog (<i>Rana sylvatica</i>) was seen at the campground during the day, a Red
Squirrel (<i>Tamiascrurus hudsonicus</i>) entered a vehicle to steal
food and Wood Thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustelina</i>) were heard at sundown. An
aquatic insect, quite small, was seen to strike the water surface repeatedly,
perhaps in an egg-laying motion, while doing an aerial dance above the stream.
Also noted here were small water striders. In the evening of 7-12-97 a Catbird
(<i>Dumetella carolinensis</i>) was heard in the swamp and Barred Owls (<i>Strix varia</i>) regaled us with a variety of calls each night.
<p> The first of our spot inventories on
7-13-97 along FR 645 was conducted just west of the campground entrance at an
elevation of close to 3000 feet  (915 m)  asl. The slope here is gentle with a
north aspect. The mature canopy consists of White Oak, Northern Red Oak, Red
and sugar Maples, Tuliptree, Shagbark and Pignut Hickories, Black Birch and
Canada Hemlock. It is likely that this forest had been thinned by the Forest
Service. Although no real understory was present, Striped Maple, Witch Hazel,
Maple-leaf Viburnum and a gooseberry (<i>
Ribes </i>sp)  occurred in the open forest.A <i>Carex</i>, almost certainly <i>Carex
 gracillima</i>-- although with a quite
hairy perigynia- was very abundant. Other herbs were Black Cohosh, Downy
Rattlesnake Plantain, Mealy Bellwort, Sessil-leaved Bellwort, Wild Geranium,
Hog Peanut, Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Bushy Panic Grass, Rattlesnake Fern, Christmas
Fern, Lance-leaved Wild Liquorice, Purple Bedstraw,  (seeds were present on
both of the last two species)  Foam Flower, abundant New York Fern in openings,
Interrupted Fern, Dotted St. Johns-wort, Great Chickweed, Creeping Five-leaf (
probably <i>Potentilla simplex</i>),  Round-leaf Violet, Hairy
Angelica, Indian Turnip, Blood Root, Spotted Wintergreen, Tree Clubmoss, Saw
Brier, unidentified species of <i>Carex</i> and abundant Delicate Fern Moss. Red-eyed
Vireos called and a loud drummer, perhaps a Pileated Woodpecker, was heard.An
interesting beetle, near a cm in length,with amber wing covers, each bearing
widely separated black patches, was observed clustered on oak seedlings. This
beetle had also been observed in other widely separated parts of the Central
Appalachians.
<p> The presence here of Sugar Maple and
a generally more diverse and mesic ground flora than recorded previously for
upland forest in the Watershed, may be related to the exposures of Ordovician
limestones on upper slopes of Potts Mountain, and which could influence the
colluvial deposits on which this forest lies.
<p> The site of the next spot inventory
is approximately 1/2 mile  (0.8 km)  west of the first at an elevation of 2950
feet  (890 m)  asl. It is on a steeper north-facing slope just south of the
road. The young to mature canopy consists of Red and Sugar Maples, Pignut
Hickory, Tuliptree, Black and White Oaks and Canada Hemlock. Striped Maple and
Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus </i>sp)  form an understory and Witch Hazel,
Upland Low Blueberry and Gooseberry (<i>
Ribes </i>sp)  shrub layers.
Conspicuous elements of the ground flora were Ground Pine and Roundleaf Pyrola
 (in bloom),  particularily under Hemlock. Other herbs were Christmas Fern,
Downy Solomons Seal or Many Knees (<i>Polygonatum pubescens</i>),  Spotted Wintergreen,
Creeping Five-leaf, Large Twayblade Orchid, <i>Carex
gracillima</i>, Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum
thalictroides) </i>, Lance-leaved Wild Liquorice, ebony Spleenwort and Canada
Mayflower. As at the last site, Saw Brier was the characteristic vine on this
acid soil. Although fungi were not common, Scarlet Cup (<i>Sarcoscypha coccinea</i>) was conspicuous and coral fungi were also
present. The environment here appears to be decidedly moister and somewhat more
acidic than at the first inventory site. This is probably attributable to the
steeper, more shaded slope. Herbs also are far less diverse, again reflecting
the deeper shade and more closed canopy.
<p> The third spot inventory was
conducted at the junction of FR 645 and Rt 613 at an elevation of about 2900
feet  (870 m)  asl on a slope with a west aspect. The canopy at this site is
dominated by large Northern Red Oak with associated Tuliptree, Red and Sugar
Maples, Cucumbertree and Canada Hemlock. Understory and shrub layers consist of
American Chestnut sprouts, Striped Maple, Flowering Dogwood, serviceberry,
Sourwood, Witch Hazel, Great Rhododendron and Upland Low Blueberry.
Abundant Northern Red Oak, fewer
Chestnut Oak, scattered Scarlet Oak and unidentified Azalea seedlings were
present. Here also Saw Brier was the only vine seen. Ground cover included
abundant Canada Mayflower, Wild Sarsaparilla, a Disporum  (Likely <i>D</i>. <i>lanuginosum
</i>), Christmas, Hay-scented and New York Ferns, Roundleaf and unidentified
violets, Squaw Root, Four-leaved Yam and a possible <i>Melanthium</i>. A Ruby-throated Hummingbird (<i>Archilochus colubris </i>) was also seen.
<p> The site of our fourth spot
inventory was the junction of FR 734 and Rt 613, where the latter turns sharply
east up the mountain. A bench mark here marks an elevation of 3159 feet  (963 m
) asl. As at the previously inventoried site. the canopy is dominated by
Northern Red Oak, with Red and Sugar Maples, White Ash, Pignut Hickory, Chestnut Oak and a little
Cucumbertree. Birch saplings appeared to be Black Birch. Sourwood, Striped
Maple and Flowering Dogwood constituted an understory. Northern Red Oak
seedlings were common and an unidentified blueberry  (probably Upland Low)  was
present as well. Herbs included abundant 
Wild Sarsaparilla, Roundleaf Violet, a disporum, a single plant of Large
Round-leaved Orchid (<i>Habenaria orbiculata</i>),  possible Wild Lily- of-
the- valley (<i>Convallaria montana</i>),  Canada Mayflower, Downy
Rattlesnake Plantain, Mountain Bellwort and <i>Leucobryum
 </i>cushion moss. Underbrush and small trees were quite abundant-
perhaps due to previous thinning- suppressing the herb flora. Scarlet Tanagers
were heard.
<p> Our last inventory, a brief one, was
conducted along FR 734, perhaps 1.5 mile  (2.4 km)  southwest of the junction
with Rt 613. Elevation here is near 3250 feet  (991 m)  asl and the aspect
northwest. The canopy consisted of rather young Sugar Maple, Beech Pignut and
Shagbark Hickories, White Ash, Northern Red Oak and Cucumbertree, with Striped
Maple in the understory. Sugar Maple was most abundant, followed by Beech. This
forest was quite open, but herbs were sparse and limited to Black Cohosh, Blue
Cohosh, New York Fern and Clearweed, with the last-named on a large block of
conglomerate. Red-eyed Vireos called.
