<p> Tea Creek falls well within the "Rugged Eastern Area"
of the Allegheny Plateau as defined by Braun (1950). Rock layers are near horizontal and along the lower reaches of
the Creek and the Williams River are part of the Mississippian Hinton
Formation. This formation is described
 (Cardwell <i>et al</i>, 1968) as composed
of "red, green and medium-gray shale and sandstone with a few thin limestone
beds." Carbonate was in fact found by
us in the form of cement in a dark, fine-grained sandstone flag in the bed of
Tea Creek. Topographically the area is in the most rugged part of the Plateau
province where three steep valleys converge within a few miles at the Williams River. Many peaks in the surrounding plateau rise
above 4000 ft (1220 meters) asl with 
Red Spruce Knob at 4700 ft. (1430 meters). Elevation along the Williams River at Tea Creek is about 3000 ft
(910 meters) while on the southwest side of the river the steep slope of Sugar
Creek Mountain rises to 4000 ft. in 2/3
mile (1 km).
<p> The Tea Creek Campground of the Monongahela National
Forest lies in a happy combination of mountains, flowing water and colorful
mesic forests that attract naturalists and forest enthusiasts to rendezvous
there at every opportunity. The
diversity of terrain, rock types and abundant moisture at Tea Creek encourage a
corresponding diversity in plant and animal life. In many places soil nutrients are also enhanced by the presence
of carbonates in the rock as mentioned above.
<p> The forest canopy in the bottomland and on the lower
slopes in the vicinity of the Tea Creek Campground is dominated by Yellow Birch
(<i> Betula alleghaniensis </i>), 
Sugar and Red Maples (<i> Acer</i> <i>saccharum </i>and<i> 
A. rubrum </i>), American Beech (<i> Fagus 
grandifolia</i>)  and Black
Cherry (<i> Prunus serotina </i>).  Other less abundant
species are Black Birch  (<i>Betula lenta </i>), Yellow Buckeye  (<i>Aesculus octandra </i>), Canada Hemlock (<i>Tsuga 
canadensis</i>), Cucumber and Fraser Magnolias  (<i>Magnolia 
acuminata </i> and <i>M</i>. 
<i>fraseri</i>),  White Ash
  (<i>Fraxinus americana </i>), American
Basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>),  Black Locust  (<i>Robinia pseudoacacia
</i>), Northern Red Oak  (<i>Quercus 
rubra </i>) and Scattered
Tuliptree (<i> Liriodendron tulipifera </i>).  Red Spruce  (<i>Picea 
rubens</i>)  appears almost
confined to the understory and there are some American Chestnut (<i>Castaea 
dentata</i>) sprouts. By and
large this is a young forest and trees more than a foot (0.3 meter) dbh are
uncommon except along the River where many very large Northern Red Oak
occur. The lower slope of Sugar Creek
Mountain in the nearby Cranberry Wilderness is quite different. Trees there are impressively tall and
straight, of considerably greater diameter and are perhaps 60 years or more in
age. Due to the slope and aspect,
moisture and nutrients are made available here through colluvial processes and
the rock itself, which may be the same as that in the bottomland.
<p> The understory and shrub layers at Tea Creek are diverse. 
Small trees include abundant Striped Maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>), (
Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana)  </i>, Alternate-leaved Dogwood (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i>), Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier</i> sp) and Muscletree (<i>
Carpinus caroliniana</i>) in moist,
shady areas, and hawthorn, including
Dotted Thorn (<i>Cratægus punctata</i>) and Fire Cherry (<i>Prunus pensylvanica</i>) in more open areas. Great Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) 
dominates the shrub layer in the shade but in a few places is accompanied by
the now-rare but once common American Yew (<i>Taxus
canadensis </i>), which has suffered
greatly from overbrowsing by deer. 
Other shade loving shrubs are Hobblebush (<i>Viburnum alnifolium</i>), Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis 
virginiana</i>), species of Gooseberry (<i>Ribes </i>sp <i>)</i>, and 
Wild Hydrangea (<i>Hydrangea 
arborescens </i>), of which only
one plant was seen. Various species of <i>Rubus</i>,
including Black Raspberry (<i>Rubus occidentalis</i>) and thorned Blackberries
are common in openings. There is also
considerable Thornless Blackberry (<i>Rubus canadensis</i>) in more shaded areas of the
forest edge. Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus 
canadensis</i>) occurs in moist areas and Ninebark (<i>Physocarpus 
opulifolius</i>) forms a heavy growth on the banks of the Williams
River. There is also a little Silky Willow
(<i>Salix 
serecia</i>), mainly in seeps.
<p> Because of the varied habitat and abundant moisture,
herbaceous species show extraordinary diversity. Among these are several uncommon species such as Fraser’s Sedge (<i>Cymophyllus 
fraseri</i>), a creeping mint (<i>Meehania cordata</i>) and Mountain Bugbane (<i>Cimicifuga 
americana</i>). The first two
of these are members of monotypic genera and are common in the campground
itself, while the last may be found along the Williams River Trail. Other herbs at the campground in shady areas
are White Wood Aster (Aster <i>divaricatus</i>), Intermediate Shield (<i>Dryopteris 
intermedia</i>) and Christmas (<i>Polystichum</i> <i>acrostichoides
</i>) Ferns, Wood Betony (<i>Pedicularis canadensis</i>), Blue Monkshood (<i>Aconitum 
uncinatum</i>), Indian Pipe (<i>Monotropa uniflora</i>), White Wood Sorrel (<i>Oxalis 
montana</i>), Upright Yellow Wood Sorrel (<i>O. stricta</i>), the sedges <i>Carex 
radiata</i> and <i>C. 
laxiflora</i>, a Wood Rush (<i>Luzula</i> sp.), Ground Pine (<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme </i>), and a large patch of White
Baneberry (<i>Actaea pachypoda</i>).  In more open areas around the campground are
found White Snakeroot (<i>Eupatorium rugosum</i>), Virginia Knotweed (<i>Polygonum 
virginianum</i>),  Wood Nettle (
<i>Laportea canadensis</i>) Curtis
Goldenrod (<i>Solidago curtisii</i>), Tall Agrimony (<i>Agrimonia 
gryposepala </i>), Bigleaf Aster
(<i>Aster 
macrophyllus</i>), Creeping Five-leaf (<i>Potentilla simplex</i>),  New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis</i>) 
and the alien Indian Strawberry (<i>Duchesnea
indica</i>), which in early August, was still in bloom. Additionally a common native grass here,
even where it was frequently underfoot, is the forest "bluegrass" <i>Poa alsodes</i>.
<p> In the vicinity of the streams, in moist open areas,
occur Golden Ragwort (<i>Senecio aureus</i>), Crooked-stem Aster (<i>Aster 
prenanthoides</i>), Spotted and Pale Jewelweed (<i>Impatiens capensis</i> and <i>I. pallida</i>), Tasslerue (<i>Trautvetteria caroliniensis</i>), Black Snakeroot (<i>Sanicula canadensis</i>), Mottled Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium maculatum</i>), a
northern species,  Dotted St.
Johnswort (<i>Hypericum punctatum</i>) and the grasses Riparian
Wild Rye (<i>Elymus riparia</i>), Nodding Fescue (<i>Festuca 
obtusa</i>) and Deer -tongue Grass (<i>Panicum clandestinum</i>), while in dryer areas are
found Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago 
rugosa</i>), Maryland Figwort (<i>Scrophularia marilandica</i>), Honewort (<i>Cryptotaenia</i> <i>canadensis</i>), 
Bottle-brush Grass (<i>Elymus hystrix</i>) and the sedge <i>Carex debilis</i>. Canada Mayflower (<i>Maianthemum</i> <i>canadense</i>) was seen
under Northern red Oak along the
Williams River on 9-2-97 and is likely
more common early in the season.
<p> A local concentration of plant diversity occurs along
the southeast bank of Tea Creek a little above the stream’s junction with the
Williams River. Here is rich mesic
forest with small seep wetlands and steep, well-watered banks that rise from
the shore line. One of the seeps
contained, in standing water, a community consisting of Golden Saxifrage (<i>Chrysosplenium americanum</i>), Drooping Wood Reed Grass (<i>Cinna latifolia) </i>, Golden
Ragwort, Northern Swamp Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus septentrionalis</i>) and the sedge<i>Carex 
scabrata,</i> all dominated by the gracefully arching leaves of the
manna Grass (<i>Glyceria melicaria</i>).  In contrast, a somewhat dryer area just upstream is habitat for
the forest grass <i>Brachyeltrum erectum</i>, while Muscletree almost ten
inches (25 cm) in diameter grows from the bank nearby. The steep bank which
rises beyond this point is dominated by Great Rhododendron under a thin canopy
of northern hardwoods and Hemlock with many Hemlock seedlings. However American Yew is also common here
and, characteristically, is heavily browsed by White-tailed Deer (<i>
Odocoileus virginianus</i>), from
which only the steep bank offers some protection. Herbs present on this bank include Foam Flower (<i>Tiarella 
cordifolia</i>),  Mountain Meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum clavatum</i>), Blue
Monkshood (<i>Aconitum uncinatum</i>), Broadleaf Goldenrod (<i>Solidago 
flexicaulis</i>), Partridge Berry (<i>Mitchella repens</i>), Hairy Woodmint (<i>Blephilla 
hirsuta</i>), Shining Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium lucidulum</i>) and Lady Fern (<i>Athyrium 
filix-femina</i>).
<p> The Williams River Trail follows an old logging
railroad grade just above the edge of the floodplain on which, from this
distance, Great Rhododendron and Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea </i>) are conspicuous. The forest is young northern hardwood, which, in addition to the
Great Rhododendron, has abundant Red Spruce in the understory. A tabulation of
trees successively noted at the trail's edge in a walk down this trail is as
follows: Black Birch, Serviceberry, a cluster of small Beech, a large Beech,
Beech, Sugar Maple, American Basswood, Yellow Birch, Beech, Black Birch, Yellow
Buckeye, Hawthorn and Yellow Birch. In openings near Tea Creek there is Oswego
Tea (<i>Monarda didyma</i>), which bloomed
flamboyantly in August. Seen in shady
parts of the moist trail bank were Turtlehead (<i>Chelone glabra</i>), Hairy
Disporum (<i>Disporum lanuginosum</i>), very
lush and abundant <i>Carex plantaginea</i>,, an isolated patch of Hog
Peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteata</i>), a few plants of Silvery
Glade Fern (<i>Athyrium thelypteroides</i>) 
and the Mountain Bugbane referred to earlier.
<p> Among the tall trees of the lower slope of Sugar
Creek Mountain many of the same herbaceous species occur as already listed for
the river bottom. However, among
additional species found here, was the more common congener of Mountain
Bugbane, namely Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa</i>).  Also observed were Sharp-lobe Hepatica (<i>Hepatica acutiloba</i>), 
usually an indicator of calcareous soils, and Alpine Enchanter's Nightshade (<i>Circæa 
alpina</i>), which is a cool climate indicator.
<p> Although rich, the flora identified in these late
summer and autumn inventories is probably greatly deficient in its vernal
components since many of these were probably in a dormant or inconspicuous
state. To illustrate, Ramps (<i>Allium 
tricoccum</i>) as well as other early plants have been reported for the
area (deHart and Sandquist, 1993).
<p> Other than common obtrusive species such as Red
Squirrels (<i>Tamiasciurus</i> <i>hudsonicus
</i>), no overt effort was made to 
identify fauna in the area. However
Tea Creek is a great center for owls, and most particularly Barred Owls (<i>Strix 
varia</i>), which enliven every night and on 8-3-95 set up a din which
included sounds like a great child’s squeaky toy and a very slow Whip-poor-will
(<i>Caprimulgus vociferus</i>).  However no actual Whip-poor-wills were heard!
<p> The Tea Creek/Williams River area lies in a
topographic depression which should be subject to considerable cold air
drainage from the high surrounding plateau. 
The retention of this cold air should be favored by the small slope of
the Williams River Valley and the constriction of this valley less than a mile
downstream. Another factor is the
looming bulk of Sugar Creek Mountain which shades large areas
<p> during the hottest part of the day. The cumulative effect of these factors is likely to be a
significant decrease of growing season temperatures beyond those expected for
the elevation. In harmony with this
conclusion is the prevalence of northern hardwood species and most particularly
the abundance of Yellow Birch. The
apparent resurgence of Red Spruce, as evidenced by its abundance in the
understory of this young forest, also supports this conclusion. While most shrubs and herbaceous plants of
the area are widespread species, a number —Mountain Holly, Fire Cherry,
American Yew, Mottled Joe-pye Weed, Thornless Blackberry, Drooping Wood Reed
Grass, Alpine Enchanter's Nightshade, White Wood Sorrel, Oswego Tea, Canada
Mayflower— are almost inevitably dependent on high montane or boreal
conditions. The fact that these species
are accompanied by more temperate or southern Appalachian species reflects the
moderating effects of abundant moisture and fertile soils.

<h2>Return to Tea Creek</h2>


<b>Source Walks: 7-20-01, 7-21-01 and
7-22-01</b>
<ul>
<p>
 This
reporter's approach to Tea Creek on 7-20-01 was via the Scenic Highway (Rt 150
) from the south. Crossing the highland, showers, heavy fog and cool
temperatures were encountered. At Tea
Creek the latter as well as an overcast prevailed. Perhaps not unusual for the
season, water in the Williams River was low.
<p> While waiting for the rest of our party, a soil
temperature (T-148) and several soil and water pH determinations were made. The
soil temperature and pH determinations were sited at on a slightly
elevated area adjacent to a temporary
stream channel. The soil here, under Yellow and Black Birches and Great
Rhododendron, appeared to be of a mor type, with a high concentration of
unincorporated organic matter just below the surface. As in subsequent
determinations, temperatures were taken at a depth of 5 inches (13 cm) and soil
for the pH measurement from a depth of 2-3 inches (5-8 cm). A temperature of
16.0 deg C was obtained, while the soil pH was found to be 4.5 both initially
and 30 hours later.
<p> Samples of water were collected from Tea Creek and
from the Williams River a little below the Tea Creek confluence. The sample
from Tea Creek yielded pH=5.8 and that from the Williams River pH=5.5.
<p> Beginning on 7-20-01 and continuing into 7-21-01, an
inventory was conducted in an area of about 1/8 acre (0.05 ha) immediately
east of our camp site and not far from the campground entrance. This area was
slightly elevated, and was thus above most wash from road limestone gravels.
The aspect was essentially flat. The canopy consisted of young trees averaging
less than a foot (0.3m) dbh and included Yellow Birch, White Ash, Black
Cherry, American Basswood, Sugar Maple and Beech. Seedlings of Northern Red Oak
and Yellow Buckeye were also present and those of Sugar Maple were very abundant.
The understory consisted of Dotted Thorn, Striped Maple, Smooth Serviceberry (<i>
Amelanchier laevis</i>), Muscletree
and Alternate-leaf Dogwood, while shrubs noted were Thornless Blackberry and
Witch Hazel. The only vine observed was Virgin's Bower  (<i>Clematis 
virginiana </i>). 
<p> Among the most conspicuous herbs were Ground Pine,
the mint <i>Meehania</i>, Christmas Fern, Intermediate Shield Fern, Curtis
Goldenrod, Wrinkle-leaf Goldenrod, Wood Betony and<i>Carex plantaginea.</i> Less conspicuous were the
sedges <i>Carex laxiflora, C. debilis, C. 
swanii and C. appalachica</i>,
the grasses <i>Brachyelytrum erectum,
Poa alsodes</i>, Deer-tongue Grass,
Nodding Fescue, Drooping Wood Reed Grass and Bottlebrush Grass, White Wood
Aster, Big-leaf Aster, Blue Wood Aster (
<i>Aster cordifolius </i>), Flat-top White Aster (<i> A. 
umbellatus</i>),  White
Snakeroot coming into bloom, Woodland Strawberry (<i> Fragaria 
vesca</i>), White Baneberry, Plume Lily, <i>Potentilla simplex;</i> blooming Daisy Fleabane  (<i>Erigeron 
annuus</i>),  Hairy Sweet Cicely
(<i> Osmorhiza claytoni </i>), Sweet White Violet  (<i>Viola blanda </i>), Golden Ragwort, the alien Heal-all  (<i>Prunella vulgaris</i> var <i>vulgaris</i>),  Tall Agrimony, Creeping Phlox  (<i>Phlox 
stolonifera </i>), Sweet-scented
Bedstraw  (<i>Galium triflorum</i>),  Great Chickweed (<i> Stellaria pubera </i>), Hog Peanut, Honewort, Foam Flower, Wood
Anemone  (<i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>),  Filmy Angelica  (<i>Angelica triquinata</i>),  an unidentified gentian (
<i>Gentiana </i> sp),  Partridge Berry (on edge of the area), 
Northern Swamp Buttercup, Thin-leaved Sunflower  (<i>Helianthus decapetalus</i>),  the Trail Rush  (<i>Juncus 
tenuis </i>), Basil Balm (<i> Monarda 
clinopodia </i> and Virginia
Waterleaf (<i> Hydrophyllum virginianum</i>) .  Rare herbs were represented by a few stalks of Wild Lettuce (<i> Lactuca 
canadensis</i>),  Tall Meadowrue
(<i> Thalictrum pubescens </i>) and a single plant of beautifully-blooming Ragged Fringed Orchid
  (<i>Habenaria lacera </i>). 
<p> Bryophytes conspicuous to the unaided eye included a
large, beautiful <i>Atrichum</i> moss (likely <i>A</i>. <i>undulatum </i>) and various species of <i>Mnium, </i>such as <i>M. hornum</i>. A bryophyte sample from various
substrates of the area was also collected and examined under the microscope by
R. Hunsucker. The following species, with liverworts indicated by the symbol
(Li), were found:
<ul>
 
<p><i>Brachythecium acuminatum</i> – on bases of trees, soil
<br><i>Dicranum scoparium</i> – on soil
<br><i>Entodon compressus</i> – on bases of hardwood <i>Frullania brittoniae (Li)</i> – on bark of hardwoods
<br><i>Hypnum curvifolium</i> – on rotting wood, humus,
bases of trees
<br><i>Mnium cuspidatum</i> – on soil
<br><i>Mnium hornum</i> – on wet areas of soil
<br><i>Pylaisiella selwynii </i>– on bark of hardwoods
<br><i>Thuidium delicatulum – </i>on bases of trees, rotten
wood, humu<i>s</i>
<br><i>Ulota crispa </i>– on bases of hardwoods
</ul>
<br> Unfortunately, the previously
mentioned <i>Atrichum</i> was unintentionally omitted in this sample. 
<p> A few fungi identified
immediately by R. Hunsucker were the
edible<i>Boletus chrysenteron</i> and
a member of the<i>Russula 
fragrantissima </i>complex with an almond-like odor.
<p> A soil temperature determination
(T-149) was also made here and a soil sample collected, both at the usual
depths. The soil temperature was found to be 17.0 deg C and the soil sample,
which appeared to be of the mull type,but with abundant raw organic matter and
fine feeder roots as well, had pH=4.5 both initially and 30 hours later.
<p> Immediately to the east of the
above inventoried area, on the other side of a temporary stream channel, there
was a somewhat different - likely more
acid and nutrient poor - community dominated by Great Rhododendron, with a
sparse ground flora of the wood rush<i>Luzula 
echinata</i>, Round-leaf Violet (<i> Viola rotundifolia </i>) and patches of an unidentified <i>Polytrichum</i>
moss. Also noted was the edible fungus<i>Russula xerampelina.</i>
<p><i> </i>Additional fungi identified
by R. Hunsucker from the general area of the foregoing inventories were as
follows:
<ul>
<p><i>Amanita farinosa</i>
<br><i>Amanita flavoconia</i>
<br><i>Amanita rubescens –</i> (The Blusher), edible
<br><i>Amanita vaginata</i>
<br><i>Boletus subtomentosus – </i>edible
<br><i>Boletus variipes</i> – edible, good, found especially
under Beech, oak
<br><i>Cantharellus cibarius</i> - edible, excellent
<br><i>Collybia confluens</i> – edible, but worthless, on leaves and
needles
<br><i>Entoloma</i> sp
<br><i>Fomes fomentarius</i>
<br>Ganoderma applanatum
<br><i>Inocybe </i>sp
<br><i>Inonotus obliquus</i> – said to be &quot;anti-tumor&quot;
<br><i>Lactarius hygraphoroides</i> – edible, excellent
<br><i>Lactarius piperatus</i>
<br><i>Lactarius volemus</i> – edible, good
<br><i>Lycoperdon 
perlatum</i>
<br><i>Marasmius </i>sp
<br><i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i> – (Oyster Mushroom), edible, excellent
<br><i>Pluteus arreinus</i>
<br><i>Ramaria</i> sp<i></i>
<br><i>Russula </i> sp
<br><i>Trametes versicolor</i>
<br><i>Tricholomopsis platyphylla-</i> (&quot;Platterfull&quot;), edible
<br><i>Ustulina deusta</i> – especially on dead roots of Beech, maple
<br><i>Xeromphalina kauffmanii</i>
</ul>
<p> In the afternoon a short
traverse was made up-stream on the east bank of Tea Creek, a known site of
Canada Yew, This traverse was essentially through the ecotone between the steep
forested bank and the rocky stream bed.
<p> A soil temperature (T-150) and a
sample were taken at the usual depths on the lowest part of the steep bank. The
temperature was found to be 16.0 deg C while the soil had a pH of 4.4 initially
and 4.0 thirty hours later.
<p> Seen in succession as we moved
up-stream were American Spikenard (<i> Aralia racemosa </i>), Beech, Yellow Birch, Hemlock, a
Cucumbertree seedling, Sugar Maple, a sapling of Yellow Buckeye, Witch Hazel,
White Ash (on shore line), Tall Coneflower (<i> Rudbeckia laciniata </i>), Dutchman's Pipe Vine  (<i>Aristolochia macrophylla</i>),  Chri<i>stmas Fern, Smooth Serviceberry, Crooked-stem Aster,
Carex torta in stream bed, Mountain
Maple  (Acer spicatum</i>),  
unidentified species of Sphagnum moss (<i>Sphagnum </i> sp or
spp)  on rock at the edge of the stream
bed, the fungus <i>Lactarius piperatus</i>;
then Canada yew, followed by <i>Carex 
scabrata,</i> Honewort, Broad-leaf Goldenrod, Wild Hydrangea, Flowering
Raspberry,  (<i>Rubus odoratus </i>), Maple-leaf Viburnum  (<i>Viburnum acerifolium </i>), Wide-leaved Joe-pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium purpureum </i>), Kidney-leaved Twayblade (
<i>Listera smallii </i>), Large Round-leaved Orchid  (<i>Habenaria orbiculata </i>) and, in
a rocky seep, the rare White Monkshood (<i> Aconitum reclinatum </i>) which, however, was not in bloom.
<p> A bryophyte sample collected
here and later identified by R. Hunsucker, included the following:
<ul>
<p><i>Fontinalis sullivantii</i> – attached to submerged
rocks
<br><i>Mnium punctatum</i> – saturated soil by stream
<br><i>Scapania
 nemorosa (Li)</i> – on wet soil, rocks by and
in stream
</ul>
<p> On returning to camp a pH
determination was made of soil next to the camp road and in the open, but
covered by a rank growth of herbs and shrubs that included Black Elderberry,
Winterberry Holly  (<i>Ilex verticillata </i>), Ox-eye  (<i>Heliopsis helianthoides </i>) and Oswego Tea. A pH of 5.5 was obtained. However this area may
have been contaminated by road gravel or other anthropogenic chemicals.
<p> The morning of 7-22-01 dawned
with the short calls of Veeries  (<i>Catharus fuscescens</i>)  Red-eyed Vireos (<i> 
Vireo olivaceus </i>), American Robins (<i> Turdus 
migratorius</i>)  and
unidentified birds. Red Squirrels and Eastern Chipmunks  (<i>Tamias 
striatus </i>) were active as
well.
<p> Our third inventory was
conducted on the steep basal slope of Sugar Creek Mountain immediately
southwest of the campground entrance and within the Cranberry Wilderness. The
area was the subject of a brief earlier inventory as reported on above. While
the general slope over the first ¼ mile (0.4 km) ascent here is about 13 deg,
slopes of 30 deg are common and many are steeper within the area inventoried.
The aspect is almost directly northeast, the forest canopy young, but mature.
It is dominated by Sugar Maple, American Basswood, Yellow and Black Birches,
Black Cherry, Beech, Northern Red Oak and Yellow Buckeye. Scattered Canada
Hemlock was the only conifer observed. Striped Maple was the most common
understory species, Black Elderberry virtually the only shrub except for a very
little Great Rhododendron, and Dutchman's Pipe the only vine.
<p> Down
trees, especially uprooted Beech, were common and the slope rocky, with many
large moss-covered blocks, likely mostly sandstone. All rocks tested failed to
effervesce to acid, and these included soft, fine grained, light gray
&quot;limy-appearing&quot; specimens.
<p> The most conspicuous herbs were<i>
Carex plantaginea</i>, Christmas Fern
and Intermediate Shield Fern, but in moist seepy areas Wood Nettle excluded
virtually all others, Among the most widespread herbs were Sharplobe Hepatica, <i>Meehania cordata,</i> Indian Turnip  (<i>Arisaema 
triphyllum </i>), Hairy
Disporum, White Snakeroot, Large-flowered Bellwort  (<i>Uvularia grandiflora </i>), Sweet-scented Bedstraw, Blue Cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i>),  Black Cohosh, Silvery glade Fern, Ramps and White Baneberry.
Less widespread were Broad-leaf Goldenrod, Great Chickweed, Wild Ginger  (<i>Asarum 
canadense</i>),  Two-leaved
Toothwort  (<i>Dentaria diphylla</i>),  Hooked Crowfoot  (<i>Ranunculus recurvatus</i>),  Foam Flower, a few patches of Round-leaf Violet coexisting
with Sharplobe Hepatica, Alpine Enchanter's Nightshade, Canada Violet (<i> Viola 
canadensis</i>),  a very little
Mealy Bellwort (<i>Uvularia perfoliata</i>),  Virginia Waterleaf, Broad-leaved
Waterleaf  (<i>Hydrophyllum canadense</i>),  a small patch of Canada Mayflower, a single Ebony
Spleenwort  (<i>Asplenium platyneuron
</i>) and one stem of Shining Clubmoss
(<i> Lycopodium lucidulum </i>) in association with a patch of White Wood Sorrel. In association
with another patch of White Wood Sorrel were a few tiny shoots of Great
Rhododendron.
<p> Grasses and sedges other than<i>
Carex plantaginea</i> were virtually
absent. They were represented by a few culms (with seed) of Nodding fescue,
by leaves only of the alien Meadow Fescue (<i> 
Festuca elatior </i>) and by a single square meter patch of
Millet Grass  (<i>Milium effusum</i> 
), also vegetative, and on a flat, somewhat open area.
<p> The only birds noted on this
slope were Red-eyed Vireo and White-breasted Nuthatch  (<i>Sitta carolinensis</i>).  A one inch diameter low spire shell of a
dead land snail was found and a fleeting glimpse was had of a small
unidentified frog.
<p> Fungi identified in place by R.
Hunsucker were <i>Scutellina scutellata</i>
 (Eye-lash Fungus), a species
characteristic of damp soil or wet,
rotten wood (Phillips, 1991),  <i>Xylaria polymorpha</i>, which is frequently found on
rotting stumps of Beech and maple, an unidentified<i>Xylaria,</i> possibly<i>
X. hypoxylon</i>, also on rotting wood,
an unidentified <i>Amanita</i> and the edible Oyster Mushroom  (<i>Pleurotus ostreatus </i>). 
<p> In a cursory examination the
prevalent soil on this slope appeared to be a rich mull type. Temperature (
T-151) and pH determinations of this soil were done at the same depths as
previous measurements. The temperature was found to be 16.0 deg C, while a
pH of 5.1 was obtained both initially
and after 30 hours.
<p> The distribution of a number of
herbs on this slope appeared to be quite uniform, and this was especially true
of smaller ones such as Sharplobe Hepatica and <i>Meehania.</i> Exceptions were
Round-leaf Vilolet, white Wood Sorrel, Canada Mayflower and especially Wood
Nettle. Despite the relatively moist conditions, fungi were practically
confined to decaying wood. Bryophytes were extraordinarily luxuriant however.
The relatively few species of vascular plants observed (52), despite the
obviously rich habitat, may in part be attributable to the relatively uniform
habitat and the deep shade that probably excluded many sedges, grasses and
aster-family plants.
<p> Bryophytes identified by R.
Hunsucker from various habitats on the lower slope of Sugar Creek Mountain are
as follows:
<p>On
soil over sandstone rock:
<ul>
<p><i>Anomodon attenuatus, 
Brachythecium acuminatum, Campylium 
chrysophyllum, Climacium 
americanum,</i>
<i>Entodon compressus (uncommon), Eurhynchium hians, Fissidens adianthoides, Hylocomium 
brevirostre,</i>
<i>Mnium affine, 
Mnium cuspidatum, Mnium 
hornum, Plagiochila asplenoides (Li), Rhodobryum roseum,</i>
<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>
</ul>
<p>On rotting hardwood down boles:
<ul>
<p><i>Amblystgium varium, 
Anomodon attenuatus, Anomodon 
rostratus, Brachythecium acuminatum,</i>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<p> 
<p> The distribution of forest types
in the vicinity of Tea Creek is clearly related to the topography. The
occurrence of Red Spruce on the valley flat is mirrored by its occurrence at
the highest elevations of the surrounding mountains, where it may be
distinguished on summit lines above
4000 feet  (1220 m).  The numerous
northern and montane species on the valley flat have already been referred to,
and our present inventory has expanded this list. By contrast, Red Spruce is
absent or present in very low numbers on the lower slope of Sugar Creek
Mountain, and hardwoods are visually dominant on the slope of this mountain to
the summit. However northern and montane species are not absent on the lower
slope, and some, such as Alpine Enchanter's Nightshade, Canada Mayflower,
Millet Grass and White Wood Sorrel, appear in small numbers in our inventory. This
apparent difference in behavior of Spruce and herbs may reflect the more easily
attained microhabitats required by the boreal herbs as compared to the larger
habitat requirements of large woody plants such as Spruce. Indeed, similar
behavior is observed throughout the Central Appalachians where Red Spruce does
generally not descend to as low elevations as do the boreal herbs. There is
however also an alternative explanation for the absence of Red Spruce in the
lower slope forest of Sugar Creek Mountain, namely that the soils there may be
to alkaline for Spruce.
<p> The three inventoried sites present some other
contrasts as well. The site with a flat aspect near camp has quite acidic if
fertile soils, a likely consequence of vertical acid leaching of fertile
alluvium, since such leaching is most effective on flat or convex topography.
Also the flat aspect, at least in this case, appears to have provided ample
light for some light-demanding plants. Coupled with the fertile alluvium, this
light resulted in 67 vascular plants being recorded for the small area
inventoried. The lower slope of Sugar Creek Mountain is equally if not more
mesic in character than the valley flat. Additionally, it is clearly under the
influence of colluvial processes, with far less possibility of vertical acid
leaching. While its soils too are acid, they are far less so, and the flora,
containing as it does, species such as Sharplobe Hepatica and Large-flowered
Bellwort, points to a prominent calcareous element in the available nutrients.
Thus the difference in topography appears to be largely responsible for floral
differences on what may be essentially similar geologic substrates. The same is
likely true of species richness. The northeast aspect and dense mesic canopy of
the slope forest appears to exclude most sedges, grasses and aster family herbs
The result is that only 52 vascular plants were recorded in an area many times
that of the small area inventoried on the valley flat. An additional feature
that should be mentioned is the possibility of the occurrence, both on the
mountain slope and valley flat, of 
resistant sandstone fragments from the Pottsville rocks which cap the
highest elevations and which may intrude as rock falls or erosion remnants.
Such apparently displaced rocks are common in the Alleghenies (see our
sections on the <a href=gaud.htm>Gaudineer</a> and <a href=fallsofhills.htm>Falls of Hills Creek Scenic Areas</a>) and may be
represented by some of the large blocks on the slope here.
<p> It is also informative to compare the Tea Creek and
Cathedral State Park vascular floras, since that of the latter reflects the
highly acidic and nutrient – poor substrate, which is almost everywhere also
subject to vertical acid leaching. The result is the virtual absence of a
number of demanding canopy species and a depauperate herb flora, despite its
splendor as an old growth forest. It will be of special interest to compare the
bryophyte floras of the two forest types.
<p> The first five most frequently occurring
bryophytes, are all of wide
distribution, especially in eastern North America. These species are also
characteristic of both acidic and calcareous environments. None are markedly
northern or montane in distribution. Excepting <i>Anomodon attenuatus</i> and <i>Thuidium delicatulum,</i> which are prominent at
Cathedral Park as well as here, both species composition and their frequencies
differ greatly in the two forests. At Tea Creek strong acidiphiles are
represented by only a few infrequent species such as <i>Mnium hornum </i>and <i>Dicranum scoparium</i>. However the latter as well as
one occurrence of the former are confined to the vertically leached area on the
valley flat.
<p> Something more also needs to be
said about the Canada Yew, since Tea Creek is one of the few locations in the
Central Appalachians in which this once-common plant may still be seen, albeit
in a much degraded state. It appears to survive on steep slopes along Tea Creek
itself, chiefly because White-tailed Deer browsing is less intense there than
in more accessible locations. Because this species, more than virtually any
other, reflects mismanagement of the forest, this reporter has for years been
urging that it be listed as a sensitive
species on the Monongahela National Forest (Mueller, 1992).  Because Yew is
here at its extreme southern range limit, it probably is represented by a
distinct ecotype adapted to Central Appalachian conditions. Its extreme rarity
compared to its former abundance should also warrant that it be listed under
the federal Endangered Species Act and areas of its present and former
occurrence designated Critical Habitat. According to Strausbaugh and Core (
1977) Yew is found in &quot;cool, shady areas&quot;. Such areas exist most
frequently in un-logged, mature forests. Such forests provide less food and cover for Deer, so their numbers are lower
and the intensity of browsing is decreased from its existing destructive
levels. Consequently, listing this species, and designating critical habitat,
would require a great decrease in logging, road building and any other activity
that opens up the forest.
