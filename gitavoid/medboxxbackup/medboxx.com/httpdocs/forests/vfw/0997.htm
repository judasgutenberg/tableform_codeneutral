So far this year we have inventoried more than 20 individual sites in the Jefferson, George Washington and Monongahela National Forests and are in the process of adding these to our computerized database which now exceeds 60 sites.  Included is our detailed study of the Blowing Springs Area of the George Washington National Forest  for which our lists of vascular plants and bryophytes approach 400 and 70 species respectively.  Our 12 page report on the areas is available on request.  A report on Geology and Reserve Design (<cite>Wild Earth</cite>, vol. 12#7, 1997) also saw recent publication.<p>		<dd>A recent achievement of our inventories was the discovery in Bland County, Virginia of a previously unknown colony of the rare Appalachian endemic shrub Piratebush (<i>Buckleya distichophylla</i>).  The project has also born fruit in our on-going effort to improve enforcement of the Endangered Species Act and other forest-protection laws.  In early August  the U.S. Department of Agriculture¹s Inspector General¹s office informed us that it was initiating an Audit of the Monongahela National Forest in response to issues raised by us earlier and that  the probe would be extended to the George Washington NF in October also based on our complaint.<p>	<dd>If more information is desired on any of these subjects, don¹t hesitate to contact us.<p>	Robert F.
