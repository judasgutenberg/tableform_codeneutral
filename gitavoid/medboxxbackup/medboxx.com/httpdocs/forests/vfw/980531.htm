In West Virginia and eastern Kentucky, coal companies now blast as much
as 600 feet off the top of the mountains, then dump the rock and debris
into mountain streams.  Over 300,000 acres of the most beautiful and
productive hardwood forests in America have already been turned into
barren grasslands.   Mountaintop removal mining increases flooding,
contaminates drinking water supplies, cracks foundations of nearby
homes, and showers towns with dust and noise from blasting.
<p>
The Mountaintop Removal Road Show includes a stunning slide show about
the impacts the mountaintop removal on coalfield communities featuring
traditional Appalachian mountain music and shocking aerial photos of
decapitated Appalachian mountains.

Bio:  Dave Cooper is a resident of Lexington, Kentucky. After 20 years
working as a mechanical engineer in various industries, most recently
at the 3M plant in Cynthiana, Kentucky that makes Post-it notes, he
decided to devote his full attention to environmental issues after
seeing a mountaintop removal mine on Kayford Mountain, West Virginia.
<p>
He is a member of the Sierra Club and Kentuckians for the Commonwealth,
and worked for a year as a coalfield organizer for the Ohio Valley
Environmental Coalition (OVEC).  He is currently organizing a national
speaking tour to educate communities across America about Mountaintop Removal
