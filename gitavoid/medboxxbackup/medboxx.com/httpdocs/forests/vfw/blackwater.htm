The Blackwater Canyon (pictured) is one of the most spectacular views in the East.  It is the place through which the dark waters of the unique Canaan Valley plateau drains down to the Cheat river.  Photos of this site are featured on much West Virginia tourism literature.<p>

Unfortunately, much of it is held in private hands, and the owner has announced plans to log a vast tract and sell the logged land for condominium development.  The cutting is scheduled to begin in September.  This is an emergency.<p>
