<b>Mr. Thomas:</b><p>
<b></b>	The following are my comments on the Burner Mountain/Mountain Lick
Environmental Assessment (EA).<p>
	In many respects this is a strange document.  Of course, along the way some
authority figure decided that all these trees must be cut, all the roads built
as the powers that be would have us believe are dictated by the long outdated
and destructive Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (FLRMP).  However
parts of the EA seem almost like a cry for help from a more rational element,
quoting the National Forest Management Act, the Council of Environmental
Quality and Even Reed Noss!  It seems as if they're saying "stop me before I
kill again."  However I recommend they help themselves with a rebellion against
this corrupt agency which approaches its problems much like the tobacco
industry.<p>
	As it stands the EA is dominated by the same old false logic as ever, as on
page 3 where it is stated that this young forest is "skewed toward older age
classes," a statement that is refuted by their own data as presented on page
49.  On page 4 cutting is justified by wildlife needs without stating that most
wildlife will be harmed by cutting.  There is also reference to "escape cover,"
a buzz word recently invented to justify cutting in remote Bear habitat.  On
page 52 we read the ambiguous statement "Bears are also highly sensitive to
road density, but again, based on the information above, road density in any of
the action alternatives is not expected to significantly affect bear
populations."  One has only to look at the maps to see that the entire project
area is riddled with roads and the fact that some of these roads would be
legally closed to vehicles would help little since all roads provide easy
access at least to walkers and thus pose a constant threat to Bears.<p>
	The entire treatment in the EA of the edge effects and forest interior species
is self-serving distortions.  There is a valid and extensive effort to
calculate the amount of edge which is certainly unprecedented for the Forest
Service.  However the statement on page 63 that "for the action alternatives,
the ratio of interior to edge areas would drop only slightly," is highly
misleading because the area is already so highly fragmented by roads and
openings that it isn't easy to fragment it more even under the action
proposals.  It is stated that of the 14 species of neotropical migrant birds
showing significant decline in West Virginia the majority of these species
depend on young brushy/open habitat whereas the majority showing an increase
are species that require mature forest land."  If this is true, it bucks the
national trend and should be <i>encouraged</i> and not undone by timber
cutting.  Certainly there is no shortage of brushy and open country even in
West Virginia, which at one time was almost entirely forested and at that time
must have had many more interior than open-loving species.  It is this original
forest that we should compare with today's depauperate and mismanaged national
forests.  Seen in this light the decline of open-loving species is desirable.<p>
	As usual there is no mention of the enormous negative effects of logging on
the forest floor with its attendant long recovery times of herbaceous
vegetation as documented by Duffy and Meier (1992) and the analogous effects on
salamanders by Petranka <i>et al</i> (1993) and Raymond and Hardy (1991).  By
my observation many parts of this project are very rich in herbaceous species,
some not common such as <i>Panax trifolius</i> as well as a great variety of
Trilliums, Orchids, etc.  The Forest Service has not figured out yet how to
obscure these documentations of the destructive effect of logging on the forest
floor and its species!  In the EA there are repeated references to "Bear/Turkey
association" without any mention -- except by accident-- of the other members
of this association.  Does it, for example, include reptiles such as the Forest
Rattler (<i>Crotalus horridus</i>), salamanders, frogs, mosses, fungi and the
many herbaceous and non commercial woody plants?  A conflict arises when the
Forest Service touts the advantage to Bear and Turkey of even age cuts and
wildlife openings without considering the effects of these openings on forest
interior  species --indeed most species of the "Bear/Turkey association."  In
addition to suffering from the pervasive fragmentation of the area there is no
consideration of the effect of encouraging enhanced Turkey populations around
managed openings.  These greater Turkey populations could well result in
increased foraging for reptiles and amphibians such as rare salamanders and
even ground nesting birds such as many species of warbler.  This conclusion was
supported by Dr. Thomas Pauley, an authority on the Cheat Mountain salamander
in a phone conversation with me.  The Forest Service is seeking to discredit
this proposal which I made in several appeals but they will not succeed and it
eventually will have to be considered.<p>
	A species which has a special role is the Canada Yew (<i>Taxus canadensis</i>)
which I have suggested (Mueller, 1992) be added to the official sensitive
species list for the Monongahela.  It reflects years of mismanagement that has
increased deer numbers beyond carrying capacity .  On page A-4 of Appendix A,
in response to this issue, it is stated that "Yew populations are not known to
occur in the project area."  Since the northern hardwoods of Mountain Lick in
particular are Yew habitat this statement supports my contention, namely that
the Yew has been extirpated.  Where I have encountered this plant on the
Monongahela it is usually confined to steep rocky slopes that deer find
difficult to reach.<p>
	The state of proposed, endangered, threatened and sensitive species (PETS)
species on the Monongahela is a disaster!  While many species are listed in the
Forest Plan "for consideration as Regional Forester's sensitive species"
citizens come to a rude awakening that many if not most of these  FLRMP listed
species did not make it to the Regional Forester's list!  This deception is
carried further when an attempt -- such as mine -- is made to obtain the
official Regional Foresters' sensitive species list but these attempts are
rebuffed even under a Freedom of Information Act request.  The treatment of
PETS species in this EA is pathetic and the Monongahela tradition (see my
appeals) of bogus lists is continued.  Here the old strategy is invoked of
listing PETS species as located just beyond the project area as in the case of
the Candy Darter, Kanawah Minnow and Hellbender.  Or again, when the presence
of species within the area can't be denied, as in the cases of the Southern
Rock Vole, Long-tailed Shrew, Southern Water Shrew, and Northern Flying
Squirrel, either there is miraculously no effect from the proposed project or
an actual benefit accrues as in the case of the Rock Vole, which is said to
take kindly to clearcutting -- all without any evidence of a comprehensive
study of the effect of destruction of the forest floor.<p>
	On page 69 we see an example of erroneous and self-serving logic with respect
to the Northern Flying Squirrel.  They would have us believe that this
endangered species can be saved by protecting only "occupied habitat" when we
all know that such habitat must shift just as patch dynamics shifts forest
stands.  This illustrates once again that minimal protection without regard to
the disturbance regime is futile.<p>
	Among the many species missing from the PETS list are all raptors.  On page
A-2 of Appendix A reference is made to a pair of Goshawks in the area, stating
that "proposed thinning would not affect this pair since it is not located in
the vicinity of the nesting site."  If Goshawks are present here the protection
of this federally designated C2 species would seem to require keeping all
land-disturbing activities -- indeed human presence -- away from the entire
area.  Goshawks are shy, like to hunt in mature forest free from human
disturbance and require very large territories, territories as large as
virtually the entire project area.  This bird as well as the Coopers and
Sharpshinned Hawks are listed in the Forest Plan as proposed sensitive species.
the failure to express any concern for any of these birds, which are in decline
and in the case of the Goshawk, at the southern extremity of its range, is a
serious failing.  Proper treatment would include inventories of stick nests,
kill evidence, sightings and vocalizations.<p>
	It is also curious that the PETS list omits totally any rare bats, a number of
which have their nurseries and foraging areas in mature forest.  In addition
there is not one plant listed.  What of the Glade Spurge, for example?  What of
the many species of orchids recommended to be included as sensitive in the
FLRMP?  Surely some must be making themselves known in Milwaukee as well as
Elkins.  Also many species such as Goldenseal and Ginseng (<i>Panax
quinquifolius</i>) come to mind.<p>
	As usual there is only limited mention of cumulative effects and none with
regard to the biological systems.  Also the range of alternatives is sick with
nothing but even age and thinning (for future even age?)  and no restoration
alternative.<p>
	With respect to old growth.  On page 64 we read that "Areas managed for old
growth values should be distributed to minimize fragmentation of old growth
into small isolated areas, Delfs, 1993)."  Yet the proposal goes on to
designate small fragments of "mature habitat" mostly in riparian areas,
fragments too small and not representative enough to endure long enough to
develop into true interior old growth if one believes Harris (1984) Martin
(1992) and others.<p>
	Finally the presentation leaves much to be desired.  True North is not
accurately known on some maps and mature habitat not on some.<p>
