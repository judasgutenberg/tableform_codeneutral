<p>
1. They destroy the forest floor with its delicate balance of organisms, root
structures and dens.  If rare and endangered species are present, they may be
lost forever under the tracks of bulldozers.<p>
2. Soils are bared, sunburned, compacted by heavy machines and are subject to
surface wash.  Because of rapid saturation during rains, they erode and streams
are silted up.  Nutrients are leached away.<p>
3. The removal of many small logs, which are relatively rich in nutrients,
depletes the soil.  The result is a gradual decline in forest productivity and
increased vulnerability to pollutants such as acid rain.<p>
4. When hardwoods regenerate in clearcuts many sprouts from small trees that
were cut rot because they originated high on the stump.  Pruning these is
expensive.  By contrast, selectively cut  large hardwoods sprout less and are
propagated more by seeds.<p>
5. When conifers such as pine or spruce are planted in clearcuts herbicides
that poison watersheds are used to suppress hardwoods.<p>
6. The many small trees of clearcuts are expensive to cut, remove and transport
relative to large trees on a board foot or volume basis.  The result in
National Forests is below cost timber sales.<p>
7. Even-aged stands of trees that result from clearcutting lack the vertical
structure and other features of habitat diversity of natural forests of
uneven-aged stands.<p>
8. Large snags and den trees are lost during clearcutting or, when saved, soon
blow down.  In any case our rarest birds and animals don't like to nest and den
in clearcuts.<p>
9. Clearcuts and the roads to them fragment habitat in unnatural ways.  They
create edge effects in a world with too many edge effects already.<p>
10. Clearcuts and their edges encourage alien and native weed species and
predators that invade, prey upon and drive out increasingly rare native species
of the adjacent forest.<p>
11. Clearcuts provide little hard mast such as acorns and other nutritious food
for many years.<p>
12. Clearcuts encourage wildlife that is already common -in many cases to the
point of destructiveness- on private lands and discourage our rarest and most
endangered species.  Thus they are among the threats to our planet's
biodiversity.<p>
13. Clearcuts in National Forests benefit large special interests such as paper
companies and their contractors by providing cheap government-subsidized pulp
wood.<p>
14. Clearcuts also benefit certain U.S. Forest Service bureaucrats by creating
jobs for timber managers, road engineers and other land rapers while denying
funds to badly needed ecologists.<p>
15. Let's STOP ALL CLEARCUTS!<p>
