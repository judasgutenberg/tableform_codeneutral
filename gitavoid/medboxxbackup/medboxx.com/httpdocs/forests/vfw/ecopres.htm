<p>The following article was first published in the Mabon, 1985
Edition of <i>Earth First! </i>(<i>V,</i>
VIII, 20 -21). However, virtually all
descriptions of conditions in the article are 
as pertinent at this time (June, 2003) as when they were first
written. The article is offered as background for long range planning that
extends beyond current specific wilderness or other preserve proposals such as
may form parts of US National Forest Plan revisions or private land trust
planning. However some suggestions, such as the priority given to riparian
zones, could, with great advantage, be included in the latter.

<p> During
the past decade many millions of acres of public lands have been set aside in
the West, and particularly in Alaska, for the expressed purpose of preserving
whole ecosystems - and even many of these large preserves are clearly
insufficient. Yet in the eastern United States only small fragments have been
designated. Why? Is it because the eastern ecosystems are less worthy of
protection, or is it because such protection is precluded by the large private
land holdings? To the contrary, it's generally recognized that eastern
deciduous forests, with their flood plains and prairie openings, are some of
the most diverse temperate ecosystems anywhere, while the region contains 24
million acres of National Forest land alone. 
Despite this eligibility, the acreage devoted to ecosystem preservation
is far less in the East than in the West, even when the proportion of public
lands in the two regions are compared. This state of affairs is brought to our
attention most strongly in the recent designation of eastern Wilderness Areas,
which average less than 10,000 acres, as compared with some western
Wildernesses in the range of a million
contiguous acres. Clearly, this two order of magnitude imbalance is justified
neither by geography nor by biology.
<p> We do of
course have numerous public &quot;playgrounds&quot; in the East, including
several National Parks and Recreation Areas as well as state parks, wildlife
management areas and other facilities. However, except for possibly the
National Wildlife Refuges - which are largely confined to wetlands - these
exist primarily to serve human needs, and in practice nature protection is only
ancillary to them. As we shall see, even the designated wilderness was planned
largely to satisfy human esthetic values rather than nature's requirements.
This absence of an ecological perspective and the Grand Vision in the East have
resulted in sundered ecosystems and lack of watershed integrity. Now it's time
for a new initiative to revise and upgrade nature protection in the region.
<p> In a
stimulating article (EF! Eostar,1983), Reed Noss proposed the creation of a
deciduous forest ecological preserve in the Ohio Valley. What could be more
logical than to extend this idea to the eastern mountain forests, given their
already substantial tracts of National Forests? Also these forests have a
certain geographic coherence and unity imposed by the NE - SW trending ranges
and inter - mountain valley streams of a strong trellis drainage pattern,
features which only lack the integration which could be gained by adequate
preserve boundaries.
<p> The Us
forest Service's recently proposed land and resource management plans for the
region again remind us of the abuse and
exploitation to which these lands have long been subject and which their
planners wish to project in the future. As a consequence there has been an
outcry from citizens, particularly in the mountain regions themselves. Under
these plans our most precious mountain landscapes would be sliced into ever
smaller fragments by roads and powerlines, and devastated by clearcuts and
mines. Wildlife would be rigidly managed as an adjunct to logging, and common
species such as deer and turkey would be favored over the wilderness species
bear, eastern cougar and the large raptors.
<p> These
Forest Service plans are totally without merit not only because of their
blatant rapaciousness, but also because they perpetuate and expand land use
practices that continue to fragment what should be unified systems and because
they subvert the most fundamental biologic and watershed imperatives. In this
day of rapid advances in the earth sciences they fail even to acknowledge the
importance of hydrologic and nutrient cycles or selectively fix on certain
aspects of these cycles to promote
their nefarious ends. For example, one stated justification for clearcutting is
that it would increase the water yield
 (read run - off) for a watershed, since getting rid of trees decreases evapo
- transpiration which feeds moisture
into the air. Never mind that this would also increase the flashiness of
streams, thereby intensifying drought, flooding and erosion, while the water -
trapping and holding capacities of the landscape and the climate - moderating
effects of evapotranspiration would be impaired. In a nutshell, the Forest
Service would ignore all the criteria for poor watershed management most
evident in the current rash of worldwide environmental catastrophe.
<p> Closely
related to these inept and deceptive water management policies is the disregard
of forest nutrient demands by proposed expanded logging of marginal timber
stands on steep terrain and dry, nutrient - poor soils, which, when bared by
clearcutting, would rapidly lose their remaining nutrients through leaching and
erosion. These points regarding nutrients have been made with particular force
for the Jefferson and George Washington National Forests by Prof. Jesse
Thompson of Roanoke College in his report to the Citizen's Environmental
Council of the Roanoke Valley. It should be obvious that the detailed nutrient
evaluation should precede any logging of these forests.
<p> Although
the land currently being logged in the eastern mountain forests is presumably
the most accessible and productive in these forests, studies by Alaric Sample
of The Wilderness Society (Issue Brief, July, 1984) have shown that the
timber sale return on management and road building is frequently 10 cents or
less per dollar invested. It's obvious that the future returns from more
leached, eroded and nutrient - poor soils would be even less, and that logging
in these mountains would eventually be less like resource extraction and more
like an armed conflict against nature.
<p> To return
these forests to a healthy, productive and ecologically harmonious state, we
must first acknowledge that the land is worthy of protection for its own sake
regardless of any short term benefits that might accrue to our species, and
that what is best for the forest is best for us in the long run. Pure
wilderness ecosystems must be given priority over the human activities which
now defile these mountains. Of course this rehabilitation of the eastern
wilderness is justified all the more by the economic bankruptcy of these
activities.
<p> Although a
variety of habitats are included within the eastern National Forest
proclamation boundaries, most actual public land holdings are confined to the
highlands, while the designated Wilderness Areas lie in the most rugged cores
of the ranges. The streams which drain these Wilderness Areas, and which
nurture their wildlife, are small secondary drainages to larger local
mainstems. In the slightly metamorphosed rocks of the sharply folded
Appalachians, these secondary streams lead into mainstems which form broad
valleys with rich flood plains between and parallel to the ranges, but in the
more massive and highly metamorphosed rocks of the Blue Ridge and elsewhere,
the drainage is more complex. As might be expected, the small wilderness
streams flow over the most resistant and nutrient - poor rocks. Fairly typical
of the Virginia wilderness is the St. Marys River, with virtually the entire
watershed in almost pure coarsely crystalline quartzite, a rock which contains
only minute amounts of the important nutrients such as potassium, phosphorus,
magnesium and calcium.
<p> Thus there
is a convention of confining nature preserves in the eastern mountains to small
watersheds, picturesque in terms of rapids, gorges and that favorite Forest
Service category of &quot;scenic vistas.&quot; While these streams are
relatively sterile biologically, they flow into the larger intermountain
streams whose flood plains are the repositories of the nutrients garnered and
concentrated from diffuse mountain sources through flood deposition and
subsurface flow. Unfortunately, although not heavily populated, the riparian
zones of these intermountain valleys are usually in a degraded state due to a
variety of human impacts, including livestock grazing. It's not for nothing
that such steams in Virginia bear names like &quot;Cowpasture,&quot;
&quot;Calfpasture&quot; and &quot;Bullpasture.&quot;
<p> All of this
brings us to a major problem. The designated Wilderness preserves are too
biologically unproductive and isolated from the nutrient - rich and diverse
riparian zones of the local mainstem valleys with which they should form a more
unified system. Rather they were designated merely to gratify narrow human
esthetic tastes for &quot;pretty scenery&quot; and invigorating hiking.
<p> In a more
recent article (EF! Beltane, 1985) Noss discusses related problems in his
review of a book by the ecologist Larry Harris (<i>The Fragmented Forest</i>
). Isolated and confined preserves don't really safeguard the species they
contain in the absence of sufficient communication with like areas through
travel corridors and without adequate buffer zones to separate them from
surrounding areas of intensive development. The importance of riparian strips
in this scheme was also stressed by Harris.
<p> In the
eastern mountains the role of drainage networks is, if anything. even more
critical than in some other areas, since there are fewer mineral nutrient
sources in their rocks as compared with the geologically young volcanic
deposits on which many western forests are developed.
<p> The eastern
mountain forests present an opportunity to create a system of ecological
preserves that could embrace areas in the range of several hundreds of
thousands of acres. These preserves could be created on the major ridges but could
also include certain of the major intermountain valleys and mainstem streams of
the trellis pattern, particularly the valleys in which some public land already
occurs. The individual areas could be linked by communication corridors which
should include riparian zones whenever possible. This system would of course
require the acquisition of some private land, mostly within National Forest
proclamation boundaries. However, this land should be acquired with minimal
impact over a considerable time period and avoid condemnation whenever
possible. These preserves would also require the closing of some Forest Service
roads and secondary routes. These closures could be mitigated in accommodating
the private land phase - out by gradually limiting traffic to private inholder
access.
<p> The
mountain wilderness cores with flanking and radiating riparian strips, and
communication corridors could give way to a surrounding zone of greater access
and more intensive human use. Although this zone would be devoted largely to
recreational activity (hunting, fishing, camping etc.), it might also include
some timber production based on rotation periods long enough to justify
economically productive selective logging. A major function of this zone would
be to act as a buffer between the Wilderness Preserve and an outer zone in
which more intensive recreation, logging and traditional firewood gathering
would be permitted.
<p> The
integration of the intermountain mainstem rivers and communication corridors
with the expanded mountain wilderness cores would provide a more viable habitat
for wilderness species and make available to them the nourishing flood plains
and diverse riparian environments of these larger streams. Wilderness
designation of these valleys would bring about the reclamation of the presently
degraded state of these riparian zones and provide new nutrient reservoirs
which would result in wildlife proliferation not seen in years.
<p> While the
concept of ecological preserves for the eastern mountains hasn't yet been
presented for public approval, there is much support for wilderness in the
region and this support favors ecological aspects rather than recreational
opportunities as was brought out in responses to Forest Service surveys (Draft
EIS for Land and Resource Management Plan for the George Washington Forest,
1985) . The public also recognizes the relationship between forest degradation
from road building, clearcutting with short rotation periods, deficit timber
sales and the unfair impact of these sales on competing private timber
production. It is only a moderate step then from this recognition to an
appreciation of the need for reclamation of the mountain wilderness on the
scale envisioned here.
<p> The eastern
National Forests which are the best candidates for conversion to ecological
preserves are the Jefferson and George Washington in Virginia. Although these
forests show a range of climatic conditions, they lie in a general trough of
low rainfall relative to surrounding areas. In addition they also occupy a belt
of shallow soils consisting largely of imperfectly weathered rock fragments (
Agricultural handbook No. 271, Forest Service, 1965) . These are the soils
developed on rocks such as the quartzites previously discussed. As a result,
trees grow relatively slowly, and while they form forests of picturesque beauty
and good wildlife cover, timber quality is poor except in local coves and
riparian zones, which should never be logged anyway. Given these conditions and
the impractical lust for timber production as evidenced by the short rotation
periods employed by the Forest Service, the timber receipts to cost ratios (
R/C) have been only 0.08 and 0.10 for the Jefferson and George Washington
respectively. In the words of Prof, Thompson, &quot;...the National Forests of
Virginia could be in better hands.&quot; I believe these hands should be those
of some agency other than the Forest Service, which has done such a poor job of
administering wilderness (EF! Yule, 1984) .
<p> Other
likely candidates for conversion to ecological preserves are the following
National Forests with their (R/C) numbers as given by The Wilderness Society:
Daniel Boon of Kentucky (0.16), Cherokee of Tennessee (0.23), The
Monongahela of West Virginia (0.30) and the North Carolina National Forests (
0.31) .Also the Jefferson - George Washington - Monongahela complex lies close
to the major population centers where water and air resources are under the
greatest stress from a multitude of pollutants and where, consequently, the
mitigating effects of significant wilderness are most urgently needed.
<p> It was the
eastern wilderness forests, spreading over plains, river banks and mountain
heights that, above and beyond all the mercenary instincts of European society,
first imbued the American soul with its special love of freedom and
independence. That wilderness deserves to live again, and it can in a system of
eastern ecological preserves.
