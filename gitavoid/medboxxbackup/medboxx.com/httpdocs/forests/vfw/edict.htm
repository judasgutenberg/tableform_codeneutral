<p><h1> More on The Ernie Dickerman Wilderness (Proposed)</h1>
<p> 
 <ul>
<p> The Ernie
Dickerman Wilderness proposal (Figure) has a number of favorable attributes
not possessed by other wilderness proposals in the eastern US.
<p> At 65,000
acres (26,000 ha), it is big, and occupies one of the few national forest
tracts in the eastern US where such a large wilderness could be designated. It
thus at once satisfies a fundamental ecological principle of island
biogeography and honors in the most appropriate way possible one of our leading
wilderness luminaries.
<p> At this
stage of our knowledge it should not be necessary to defend the idea of
unfragmented habitat and its premier manifestation – big wilderness. Much of
the scientific justification for big wilderness has been in the literature of
island biogeography for years, as summarized, particularly by Harris (1984) .
It has been detailed and popularized in
the early <i>Earth First!</i> journal, <i>Wild Earth, Conservation Biology</i>
and numerous other publications. According to this theory, which has been
substantiated by numerous field investigations, biodiversity is a direct
function of the size of unfragmented habitat. Although most large wilderness is
now confined to the West, should we not strive, here in the East, for as much
as possible as well? Should not every large tract of low road density public
land in the Mid-Atlantic States – numbering as few as the fingers of one hand –
be cherished, protected, and as soon as possible, be given legal wilderness
status?
<p> Other
favorable attributes of the Ernie Dickerman proposal, including some that are
unique, are as follows:
<p> It has
defensible boundaries. They do not impinge on state roads or intensive
recreation areas, except for a single tiny and remote national forest
&quot;picnic site.&quot; These boundaries exclude all private lands and enclose
an area as equidimensional as is possible in this region of linear mountain
ranges, thus maximizing the solitude per unit area, which is both an ecological
and recreational asset. Unlike the indefensible wilderness study areas (Little
River and Ramsey's Draft Addition) that fall within it, the area of this
proposal incorporates the ridge lines that dominate the entire region. Without
wilderness status, roads along these ridge lines would seriously compromise the
solitude of the wilderness study areas, which are confined to slopes.
<p> The
wilderness proposed here does require closing segments of several Forest roads,
in particular the segment of FR85, which runs along the highest ridge line,
dead-ends and today mars the wilderness
quality of the region. Similarly, the upper part of FR95, which intrudes along
the North River's rich flood plain, would be eliminated. The Bald Mountain
Road, which exists merely to service a few ecologically- destructive
&quot;wildlife openings&quot; of the State Department and Game and Inland
Fisheries, and which consists only of muddy ruts along another ridge line,
should have been closed long ago. In any case, closing these roads would set no
precedent, since this has been done to create a number Eastern wilderness
areas. In one case, that of the Great Swamp Wilderness of New Jersey, a township
road was closed (Scott,2001), in a far more draconian measure than is
required here. Closing roads for this wilderness could even serve a broader
purpose, namely the general principle and benefits of road closings, the many
monetary savings, the protection of our rarest forest interior species, a
meaningful way to counter global warming and the national need to undo the
decades of ill-advised road construction on our public lands. It could serve as
a classic illustration in the East!

<p> Not since
pre-settlement days would an area exist that provides such habitat integrity
and remoteness, characteristics required by 
sensitive species like Black Bear, Eastern Cougar, Fisher and large
raptors, including the Golden Eagle. It would also be a bastion against that
bane of modern society, light pollution. Many birds, insects and other
organisms are adversely affected by human produced light. An example is the
plight of large moths, which we, in our Forests of the Central Appalachians
Project, have found to be increasingly rare in settled and even mountain areas.
Thus the Great Silk Moths, such as the Luna (<i>Actias luna</i>), were observed to be fatally
attracted to campground washroom lights. In an ecological ripple effect, these
large moths play an important role in the breeding success of the Whip – Poor –
Will (<i>Caprimulgus vociferus</i>), 
a bird now also difficult to find in the Appalachians. Indeed, Shenandoah
Mountain is one of the few places where this correspondent has heard this bird
in recent years.
<p> Bolstering
the general advantage of habitat size, Shenandoah Mountain is also graced by a
number of rare disjunct and endemic species. It has one of the few occurrences
of Paper Birch (<i>Betula papyrifera</i>) 
this far south, while another disjunct is the Red Crossbill (<i>Loxia curvirostra</i>) . Although this bird has
been observed in boreal habitat in West Virginia's Alleghenies, breeding
populations are known only on Shenandoah Mountain and a few high peaks to the
south. Endemics include the Cowknob Salamander (<i>Plethodon punctatus</i>), a millipede (<i>Nannaria shenandoah</i>) and likely others. Other
species uncommon in Virginia are Red Raspberry (<i>Rubus strigosus</i>), Trembling Aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>) and Least Trillium (<i>Trillium pusillum</i> var <i>monticulum</i>) .
Shenandoah Mountain also appears to be choice habitat for the Eastern Woodrat (
<i>Neotoma floridana</i>), a species
that has been declining throughout the East. The reader may want to consult our
Forests of the Central Appalachians Project which contains an increasing number
of biological and geological inventories of the Proposal area.
<p> A
wilderness of this size could also serve important scientific functions in
baseline studies of the eastern US environment with respect to the effects of
climate changes such as may be brought about by global warming, the effects of
pollutants on forest growth and biodiversity and normal plant succession and
stability. Supplementing research natural areas such as those that already
exist in the Ramsey's Draft Wilderness, additional ones could be established in
the more diverse and remote habitats made available by this proposal. Although
many opportunities for baseline studies exist in the West, the East, despite
its greater population centers and associated needs, has far fewer suitable
areas, in further powerful justification for this proposal. Thus the Ernie
Dickerman Wilderness is one of the most rigorously based scientific proposals
conceivable.
<p> The
foregoing does not exhaust the attractions of this wilderness. There are rapidly
accumulating threats to water quality in the adjacent limestone – based
Shenandoah Valley from modern agricultural practices and urbanization, and
these threats are telegraphed downstream to population centers, including our
nation's capital. Streams in the wilderness would be protected from vehicle and
other pollution that now degrades the watershed as a consequence of existing
roads and unregulated camping. Eliminating these roads would counter some of
the downstream pollution and enhance overall water quality.
<p> So far
little has been said of the recreational resource represented by this
wilderness proposal and of its importance to the overpopulated and
urban-stressed East. In 1991 designated wilderness in the George Washington
National Forest constituted only 3%, whereas in national forests as a whole it
was 17% (Mueller, 1991) . Similar low values also prevailed in the Monongahela
National Forest and West Virginia. Also, according to Johnson (2001), less
than 2% of Pennsylvania's Allegheny National Forest is designated wilderness.
Recently these values have been increased slightly in Virginia by the addition
of two small wilderness areas totaling 11,300 acres, including one first
proposed by Virginians for Wilderness (Mueller, 1991) . Thus it is clear that,
relative to population, there is an enormous wilderness recreational deficit in
the Mid-Atlantic Region. It is obvious that the deficit of big wilderness,
wilderness that best conveys the educational, uplifting and inspiring
experience we seek from the land, is even greater. Of the Mid-Atlantic national forests, possibilities for wilderness of this size
exist only in the Monongahela and George Washington. Nothing highlights the
significance of the Ernie Dickerman proposal more than these dismal statistics.
The people of the Mid-Atlantic Region, and most particularly, the city youth, who may not be able to travel
far, and who spend most of their time in crowded urban areas, deserve this
wilderness. They deserve it, not only as an educational and recreational
resource, and as a relief from the stresses of their world, but also as a
cleansing landscape for the water and air they depend upon each day.
<p> In 1986 Ron
Tipton of the Wilderness Society said (<i>Washington Post</i>, 11-30-86) of
this proposal (then named the &quot;Shenandoah Wilderness&quot;) : &quot;This
is something that's legitimate, that's worthwhile to support.&quot; We believe
that now, more than ever, the Society has a reason to support this wilderness,
as it honors one of its own. We need to remind The Wilderness Society, the
Sierra Club, other environmental groups and our US Congresspersons and Senators
that it's high time to do something in Ernie's memory, and decrease the big wilderness deficit in the
East. Please join this fight for big Eastern Wilderness!
