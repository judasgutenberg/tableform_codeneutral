<h3>Introduction</h3>
 
</P>
<P class="intro">	The following NASA
publication received considerable publicity and was cited by
opponents of nuclear power. Consequently it drew the ire of nuclear
proponents in Congress, who put pressure on NASA funding to stop its
dissemination. Thus, although the paper had undergone in-house review
and had been approved by the director of Goddard, a -completely

unsuccessful- attempt was later made by the Agency to discredit it.
At this point I filed a successful grievance action, the result of

which was to confirm my complete scientific freedom to publish as I
wished. However, the most satisfying outcome of all was the decision

by the Potomac Electric Power Company to not build the proposed
Douglas Point plant, which was the subject of this paper.</P>

 It is demonstrated
that in the Washington Metropolitan area electric resistance heating

projected increase in electrical generating capacity. By contrast

recycling, pollution control, increased services to poor people and
the Metro mass transit system demands will be relatively minor.</H4>

in excess of that of the proposed Douglas Point nuclear power plant,

efficiency. Many additional and alternative savings of energy and

generating capacity could also result from such strategies as total

<h2>ENERGY CONSERVATION ALTERNATIVES
TO  NUCLEAR POWER, A CASE STUDY</h2>
 

<h3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<ul>
<P>	The prodigious U.S.

appetite for energy has raised the dilemma widely known as the
&quot;energy crisis.&quot; Paralleling this crisis in resource use is

one of environmental degradation engendered by the pollutants which
emanate from our technology. Although energy problems and pollution

are becoming more apparent with each passing day, the manifold
connections between them are only beginning to be appreciated. The

relation between the known forms of pollution and the excess energy
content of pollutants has been stressed  (Mueller,1971).  Also, the

implications for planetary temperatures and the climate of increasing
the total technological energy flux has been discussed for some time.

It has been estimated, for example  (Altman, Telkes, and Wolf, 1972), that with an energy growth factor of 3.37 percent the average

temperature of the Earth's surface in the U.S. could be raised 2.5
deg F by the year 2050 a result of thermal pollution. This result

follows directly from an application of the formula P= KT<SUP>
 4</SUP>, where P is the radiated power, T the absolute

temperature and K a constant. Furthermore, these authors estimate
that if most of the technological energy is dissipated locally, as in

the Northeastern U.S., the regional temperature might rise 2-3 deg F
at an earlier date.</P>

<P>	One of the solutions
which has been proposed for the energy crisis is nuclear fission, and

more specifically the light water uranium fuelled reactors now being
installed around the country. However, this technology has heightened

the dilemma because many deep-seated problems of economics and
safety. Not the least of these problems is concerned with the safety

of the reactors themselves, since there appear to be substantial
risks of the failure of their emergency core cooling systems (ECCS),

with consequent catastrophic releases of radioactivity (Ford and
Kendall, 1972). In addition there are unsolved problems of nuclear

sabotage, in fuel reprocessing and in the transportation, storage and
ultimate disposal of wastes. Recently also, the energy efficiency of

the entire nuclear fuel cycle has been challenged  (Hoffman, 1971).
Furthermore, the low thermal efficiencies  (&lt; 32%)  of the current

generation of nuclear power reactors creates special problems of
thermal pollution and would add greatly to the level of the regional

heat flux mentioned previously. 
</P>

<P>	Although many of the
risks and uncertainties of nuclear power are coming to be recognized

by the general public, they are generally de-emphasized, and there is
much discussion of &quot;tradeoffs&quot; in environmental quality and

safety, which are necessary to relieve the energy crisis. Thus,
according to the Potomac Electric Power Company  (&quot;Nuclear

Power, because the world isn't ending tomorrow&quot;, 1972)  more
power is needed because of growth in population, businesses,

appliances, mass transit  (Metro),  pollution control, recycling and
to raise the standard of living of disadvantaged citizens. 

</P>
<P>	Late in 1972 the

Potomac Electric Power Company  (PEPCO),  whose service area contains
most of the District of Columbia, propose to build a nuclear power

plant at Douglas Point on the Potomac River 28 miles south of the
National Capital. The plant would consist of two boiling water

reactors of advanced design totaling 2,200 megawatts and would
include cooling towers to disperse the waste heat<a name=rstar4 href=#star4><sup>1</sup></a>. The nuclear

facility, rather than a fossil fuel plant was selected for Douglas
Point, according to PEPCO, &quot;... after a detailed and through

study of alternatives in 1971.&quot; The decision to &quot;go
nuclear&quot; was based on the following reasons:</P>

 

<OL>

<LI><P>Abundant uranium

	ore and a &quot;new technology which promised to make nuclear fuel
	virtually limitless.&quot;  (This presumably refers to the breeder

	reactor.) </P>
<LI><P>The nuclear plant

	would not release smoke, soot, sulfur, nitrogen oxides of fly ash
	into the air.</P>

<LI><P>In the long run
	nuclear fuels cost less than fossil fuels.</P>

</OL>
 
<P>Certain

representatives of the Federal Government have advanced the argument
that electricity can be generated efficiently in large
power stations, due to &quot;economies of size,&quot; more efficient

fuel transportation and centralized pollution control. In a recent
article G. A. Lincoln  (1973),  the retired former director of the

Office of Emergency Preparedness  (OEP), argued as follows: 
</P>



 

<P>	&quot;On
balance, it is not at all clear that electrical power generation and

distribution is as wasteful from an overall point of view as some of
its detractors would claim.&quot;</P>
 

<P>	On
balance, however, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the

argument for greatly increased generating capacity has many serious
contradictions with respect to efficiency and the best uses to which

electricity may be put. 
</P>

<P>
For example, the government has stressed in an OEP report  (The

potential for energy conservation, 1972)  that one of 

the most promising of the energy conservation strategies is the
&quot;total energy system&quot; in which the heat wasted through 
 

thermal inefficiencies of power plants would be utilized by locating
these plants in proximity to residential, commercial or 

 

industrial complexes. Yet, at the same time, it is stressed in all
current licensing procedures before the U.S. Atomic 

 

Energy Commission that nuclear power plants must be kept isolated as
much as possible from human populations. Thus 
 

the State of Maryland's preliminary environmental impact statement
for the proposed Douglas Point nuclear power plant 

 
site considers an &quot;exclusion radius&quot; of 1/2 mile, a low
population radius of 4.5 miles and a minimum acceptable distance 

 
to a population center of six miles  (Potomac Electric Power Plant,
Douglas Point site. 1973).  Thus one of the most 

 
wasteful of the electric generating technologies from a thermal
efficiency standpoint is also least subject to remediation 
against this waste. Recently this problem has also been recognized by

Meyer and Todd  (1973),  who point out that heat, 
 
unlike fuels and electricity, cannot be transmitted more than a few

miles without substantial losses. For the total energy 
 
concept to be applicable electrical generating stations must be

located to heat loads.</P>
<P>

	Secondly, the wasteful &quot;burning of  <SUP>235</SUP>U has been
justified by the hope that the more plentiful <SUP>238</SUP>U will

become  
 
available through the development of the experimental fast breeder

reactor. At the same time experiments go forward 

on more efficient burners such as gas cooled reactors. [ The safety
of nuclear power reactors  (light water cooled)    
 

and related facilities, 1972 ]. Consequently, if the breeder
experiment should fail, it would be increasingly difficult to 
justify the present generation of water cooled reactors from an

energy conservation standpoint.</P>
<P>

	I propose to show in this report that with the distribution of
electricity between the residential, commercial and 
 

industrial sectors that prevails in the Washington Metropolitan area,
nuclear power, with its attendant risks and 

 
uncertainties, is not necessary to achieve an even higher standard of
living than is available at the present time, and 

 
which is conceived for the 1980's. This conclusion is particularly
easily arrived at for the Washington area because of 

 

the modest industrial sector, but could, I believe, also be extended
to the entire U.S. with full utilization of the 
 

conservation strategies available.</P>

<H2>ESTIMATES OF POSSIBLE ELECTRICAL

ENERGY 
SAVINGS IN THE WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA</H2>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
 

 

 An attempt will be
made to show that through the application of a small number of

strategies a quantity of generating capacity in excess of that of the
proposed Douglas Point nuclear power plant can be saved. In my

calculations I shall assume that a reduction in power load of
ordinary consumer appliances allows a reduction in generating

capacity. The justification for this assumption is to be found in the
experience that such appliances as air conditioners represent peak

seasonal power loads and that extraordinary sources of transient peak
loads such as Metro traction are minor. We shall also assume, with

the proper qualifications, that the power load is approximately
proportional to the energy consumed over the seasonal interval in

which it occurs so that energy and power are apportioned similarly.
This is similar to the treatment of air conditioner efficiency by

Hirst and Moyers  (1973).  Of necessity the calculations presented
are approximate since they make use of generalized and incomplete

data, and since they deal with a projection of generating capacity
into the 1980's, which has never been justified by any official body

or supported by scientific studies. The calculations thus arrive at a
certain distribution of future power demands which depends in part on

existing demands but also in part on a process of elimination of a
variety of future demands which have been proposed to justify the

increased generating capacity. For example, it is concluded that
resistance heating, which represents a substantial part of the

residential growth in electricity use in the past decade and which is
subject to much promotion by the utilities, is a quantifiable factor

in the justification of the proposed increase in generating capacity.
In this analysis the projected justification demands are investigated

and it is found that there is a residue of uses  (such as electric
resistance heating)  which represent major potential demands on

energy and generating capacity.
<P>	Although the

calculations are approximate, they are also conservative in that they
characteristically deliberately underestimate savings and omit in the

first approximation large sources of savings.</P>
<P>	Finally, the

conclusions arrived at here go beyond a mere compatibility with high
living standards but should act to enhance those standards greatly in

both the intangibles of environmental quality and in monitory
savings. This would be accomplished through the reduction of thermal

and other forms of pollution, the elimination of threats of nuclear
accidents and through the introduction of more economical and

efficient appliances and structures.</P>

</center>






<H2>The Growth of Electrical Energy Use</H2>
<ul>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<P>	Let us first consider

the existing distribution of all U.S. energy uses in the residential
and commercial sectors  (Table 1),  since it is these uses which

represent a readily apparent for growth of demand on generating
capacity. This is especially true of  space heating since it

represents a more fundamental demand than lighting and air
conditioning, for example. It should be noted that in each case  the

various forms of direct heat, and especially space heating, dominate.
In the residential sector heat amounts to 80 percent of the total,

whereas in the commercial sector it represents 60 percent. We also
note that air conditioning forms a relatively large proportion of

energy use in the commercial sector.</P>
<P>	According to the

statistics of Hirst and Herendeen as reported by Large  (1973a),  the
growth of residential electricity use between 1960 and 1970 is as

given in Table 2. The growth of electric space  (resistance)  heating
forms the largest contribution, and all forms of direct heat amount

to 44 percent. Since in the &quot;all electric home&quot; over half
the energy is used for space heating  (Hirst and Moyers, 1973),  it

is obvious that the space heating allotment of Table 1 represents a
great potential for the promotion of electric resistance space

heating in the next decade. This conclusion is also borne out by the
PEPCO promotional literature and the result of a Gallup survey (

Crawford, 1969). </P>
<P>	Furthermore, the OEP

study  (1972)  indicates that between 1970 and 1980 some 13.1 million
new households will be created in the nation as a whole. 5.2 million,

or 40 percent, will be electrically heated, and the remaining 7.9
million will be gas or oil heated. Thus electrical resistance heating

looms as the greatest single demand on generating capacity.</P>
<P>	At the present time

one of the largest potential savings in electrical energy and
generating capacity is in the more efficient air conditioning, or in

the substitution of architectural designs in which less air
conditioning would be required. Air conditioning in particular has

been responsible for the peak summer power loads which frequently
cause power failures. However, Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate that the

trend toward all-electric homes would create a situation in which
electric space heating would demand greater quantities of power than

air conditioning, should the use of resistance heating be allowed to
grow. Thus, while air conditioning use of electricity represents some

growth potential, it does not represent the potential for peak
seasonal loads that resistance heating does.</P>

<P>	The distribution of
electric energy use on a nationwide basis among the residential,

commercial and industrial sectors is shown in Table 3, which also
shows the corresponding rounded off values for the PEPCO electricity

sales  (Table 5). </P>
<P>	An analysis by Stein

 (1972)  indicates that lighting consumes 24 percent of all
electrical energy sold in the U.S., whereas the commercial sector

accounts for about 40% of the nation's electric lighting load  (Hirst
and Herendeen, in Large, 1973a).  Thus lighting in the commercial

sector accounts for 0.40 x 24= 9.6% of the total electric energy used
in the U.S. Using Table 3 we may then calculate that the percentage

of total commercial electricity consumed by lighting is 
</P>


<P>(100) (9.6/23)  = 42%                                            (1)</P>

 

<P>It seems safe to
assume that this figure would hold approximately for the next decade

if the trend toward overlighting commercial buildings were allowed to
continue (Stein,1972).</P>

<P>	The existing and
propose growth in electrical generating capacity of the PEPCO are

shown in table 4. The present generating capacity of 4,454 megawatts
(MW) is supplied by six fossil fuel fired power stations located in

Maryland, District of Columbia and Virginia. It should also be noted
that in 1981 the total projected capacity <I>exclusive</I> of the

Douglas Point plant would be 8186 MW. Thus even without this plant a
virtual doubling of capacity would occur in less than ten years. It

is my contention that the 8186 MW of projected capacity is a valid
target for energy conservation strategies which would obviate the

need for Douglas Point. Furthermore, any additional reductions in
power load might then be directed toward reducing this 8186 MW

capacity itself and so avoid difficulties of pollution and aesthetics
which are posed by the fossil fuel plants.</P>

<P>	The figures presented
in Table 4, as well as statistics on the growth in generating

capacity ('Chalk Point PEPCO's newest and largest generating
station,&quot; 1965)  and population growth for the Washington

Metropolitan area  (Jaworski, Clark and Feigner, 1971)  are shown
plotted in Figure 1. In this figure P stands for the present

capacity, whereas W represents the total proposed capacity in 1981
according to the PEPCO. The point C, on the other hand, represents

the projected capacity exclusive of the Douglas Point plant. It is
obvious that both curves for the growth in generating capacity rise

considerably steeper than the population curve. The dotted curve P-Q
defines a growth in generating capacity which would be more in line

with population growth since it is one of a family of curves which,
although less steeply rising than P-C, exceeds a constant per capita

generating capacity.</P>
<P>	Table 5 shows the

distribution of the PEPCO electricity sales in 1972 as distributed
among the various sectors  (McNeal 1973).  These data have been shown

in rounded off form in Table 3 for comparison with the national
average. The commercial sector is more prominent in the Washington

Metropolitan area and the industrial sector less so than nationwide. 
</P>

<P>	Since the need for
the proposed Douglas Point nuclear power plant has been justified in

part by the projected electrical demands of Metro, pollution control,
recycling, and disadvantaged citizens, it is desirable to inquire

into the magnitudes of these demands, particularly with respect to
generating capacity.</P>

<P>	The question of the
electrical energy required to provide for the poor of our nation has

been considered by Large  (1973b).  He estimates that the average
annual residential electrical energy of 2200 Kilowatt hours per

person for 23 million people would represent only 3.6 percent of the
total electrical consumption. Roughly the same <I>percentage</I>

value would of course apply to our own case if we assume that the
Washington Metropolitan area is at all representative of the nation

as a whole.</P>
<P>	In the case the

electrical requirements of the Metro system it is informative to
consider first an existing mass transit system operated by the SE

Pennsylvania Transit Authority. According to official figures (
Boorse, 1973),  the peak load on this system, which consists of 324.4

miles of track. is 63,000 kilowatts or 63 MW. For the Washington
Metro the anticipated peak demand power load within the peak hour of

operation is about 260,000 kilowatts for the 32 mile system planned
for 1976  (Luhrs, 1973).  However, because of the allotment to

several different power companies, the PEPCO share is less than 200
MW. Virtually all of this peak load is reserved for traction, with

much smaller amounts allotted to air conditioning and other
facilities. The peak Metro demand is shown as a double arrow bar on

Figure 1 at M.</P>
<P>	If we now consider

recycling and pollution control, we see that these are closely
related. It has been shown  (Makhijani and Lichtenberg, 1972)  that

one of the most important justifications for recycling is its energy
conserving character. For example, the recycling of metals generally

requires only a fraction of the energy required to obtain them from
their ores. Secondly, it may be shown  (Mueller, 1971)  that

pollutants are characterized by excess energy relative to their
degradation products, which has been conferred upon them by the

manufacturing process, Also, pollution control technologies which
consume energy are prone to the same thermodynamic laws as

manufacturing processes. Consequently, pollution control which
depends on the consumption of energy is likely to fail because this

energy will give rise to additional pollution. We may therefore
anticipate that successful pollution control and recycling effects

will lead to a <I>lowered </I>demand in both energy and electrical
generating capacity per unit of production. We shall see in the next

section that this conclusion is also compatible with strategies for
reducing the consumption of electricity in the industrial sector.</P>

<P>	If no increases in
efficiency or conservation of energy were instituted in the

industrial sector, this sector may be assumed to contribute
approximately 25 percent of the future demands on generating

capacity.</P>
<P>	In summary then we

can identify a set of residual demands on the future generating
capacity which, if allowed to grow, would be substantial. Foremost

among these demands in the residential and commercial sectors are
electric resistance heating and commercial lighting. Savings in the

industrial sector are based on more complex strategies to be
discussed in the next section, but also will depend strongly on

recycling and pollution control efforts. Air conditioning also
presents a considerable potential for savings, but its potential

contribution to peak loads in the future is more limited than
heating.</P>

<P>	By contrast, the
potential for demands on electrical generating capacity by Metro,

poor people, pollution control, and recycling appear to be relatively
minor. Indeed, recycling and pollution controls should result in

energy savings, and the same is probably true of Metro if the total
energy expended in transportation is taken into account.</P>

 
</ul>
<h2>Energy Savings in Electrical
Heating,  
 Lighting and in Industrial Efficiencies</H2>
<ul>
 
<P>	Studies by Hirst and

Moyers  (1973)  indicate that if account is taken of generation,
transmission and distribution the overall efficiency of delivered

electric heat is about 30 percent. On the other hand, the end use
efficiency of a gas or oil burning home is about 60 percent if fuel

deliveries and burning efficiencies are taken into account.
Consequently energy conservation favors gas or oil heating by a

factor of two. Thus it would seem to be desirable to avoid the use of
electric energy for this purpose and divert it for such highly

efficient uses as powering motors.</P>
<P>	We shall now make the

assumption that the diversion of electric energy from resistance
heating uses is desirable and that a fraction of the proposed

increase in generating capacity <I>exclusive</I> of the Douglas Point
facility<a name=rstar href=#star><sup>2</sup></a> may be thus diverted since we have shown that electrical

resistance heating is one of the major justifications  for the
proposed capacity increase. i shall also assume that the diversion is

in approximate proportion to the electric energy sold as set forth in
Tables 1, 2 and 3, except that I shall use more conservative figures.

Thus we have seen that electric heating is likely to comprise in
excess of 50 percent of the projected energy demand for the

residential and commercial sectors. We shall assume however that only
40 percent of the generating capacity may be thus assigned. A further
conservatism is

introduced by the fact that the peak power fraction demand is likely
to exceed the fraction of energy sold for this use<a name=rstar2 href=#star2><sup>3</sup></a>. Then since the

two sectors comprise 75 percent of the power sold by the PEPCO we
have</P>

 


<P>(3732) 
x (0.75) x  (0.40)  = 1120 MW,                                  (2)</P>



<P>which represents the
proposed generating capacity which may be saved or diverted from

electric resistance heating to other uses.</P>
<P>	In addition to this

type of diversion from electric to direct fossil fuel heating, a new
technological alternative known as the &quot;heat pump&quot; should

be considered (Hirst and Moyers, 1973), since this device could
equalize  the positions of these different sources of heat from a

fuel conservation standpoint. While not yet perfected, this
technology would represent an enormous saving of electrical

generating capacity. It is therefore an additional alternative to
resistance heating.</P>

<P>	Stein (1972)  has
made a detailed study of lighting inefficiencies in commercial and

institutional buildings and has concluded that most of these
structures are grossly overlighted or make use of  inefficient

lighting facilities. He writes:</P>
<P>	&quot;To summarize,

it appears that adequate lighting could be installed in institutions, commercial buildings, schools, and so forth with less than 50

percent of the present light loads.&quot;</P>
<P>	He further details

why he believes this to be a conservative estimate.</P>
 

 

<P>	If
we now regard the Washington Metropolitan area as representative of

the conditions to which Stein refers, we may apply his estimated
savings to the propose generating capacity exclusive of the Douglas

Point facility. Also, because most lighting inefficiency in existing
buildings can be corrected, we may assume that the total proposed

generating capacity exclusive of Douglas Point is subject to such
correction. Then making use of relation (1) we have:</P>

 

<P> (8186) 
x  (0.50)  x  (0.50)  x  (0.42)  = 860 MW,                           

     (3)</P>
 

 
<P>which is the quantity

of generating capacity which may be saved by increasing lighting
efficiency by 50 percent in the commercial sector the PEPCO

electricity sales.</P>
<P>	If we now consider

the industrial sector, we find that it is generally agreed that
substantial energy savings are possible, except that they involve a

greater variety of sources. Thus from the OEP study<a name=rstar3 href=#star3><sup>4</sup></a> (1972) :</P>
<P>	&quot;Given

sufficient incentive, industry as a whole could easily cut energy
demand by 10-15 percent  (and probably more)  of the projected demand

by 1980, primarily by replacing old equipment, using more energy
conscious design, increasing maintenance of boilers, heat exchangers

etc. It should be emphasized that underpriced energy encourages
wasteful energy use.&quot;</P>

<P>	We now assume that
industry represented in the PEPCO electricity sales is subject to

this degree of energy saving and that allocations of proposed
generating capacity can be made in proportion to these sales. Since

existing industry is also subject to the type of saving detailed
above, we make use of the total proposed generating capacity. Thus

for a 10 percent saving we have:</P>
 
 
<P>(8186)

x (0.25) x (0.10) = 205 MW,                                      
                (4)                                                 
 

</P>
<P>and for 15 percent:</P>

 

<P>(8186)
x (0.25) x  (0.15) = 308 MW.					(5)</P>

 

<P>	If we now add<a name=rstar5 href=#star5><sup>5</sup></a> the
results (2), (3) and (4), we obtain as the total potential saving in

generating capacity of 2185 MW, and if we add (2), (3) and (5), we
obtain 2288 MW. Thus we have demonstrated that if only residential

and commercial electric resistance heating, commercial lighting and a
modest industrial saving are considered, a quantity of electric

generating capacity equivalent to the proposed Douglas Point nuclear
power plant can be saved or diverted to other uses.</P>

<P>	In the next section
we consider some further possible savings in energy and generating

capacity which are either in addition to those presented or represent
alternatives.</P>
 
 

</P>
</ul>
<H2>Additional and Alternative Savings in 
 Energy and Electrical Generating
Capacity</h2> 
<ul>

<P>	The following is a
list of potential savings of energy and generating capacity which

were not considered in the foregoing analysis : 
</P>



<OL>
	<LI><P>Installation of

	total energy systems to serve residential, commercial and industrial
	complexes.</P>

	<LI><P>Improvements in
	insulation in all structures.</P>

	<LI><P>Certain
	architectural improvements in the residential and commercial

	sectors.</P>
	<LI><P>Improvements in

	<LI><P>Replacement of
	residential and commercial electric resistance heating devices

	installed before 1973.</P>
	<LI><P>Installation of

	residential and commercial buildings.</P>

	<LI><P>Encouragement of
	energy saving life styles  (such as moderation of building

	temperatures and turning off lights.</P>
</OL>


<P>It
is generally recognized that the use of total energy systems is one

of the most viable options for energy 
</P>

<P>conservation when
electric generating stations can be located in proximity to human

habitations and commercial and industrial centers. It has been
estimated that the thermal efficiencies of such decentralized power

plants are at least 25 percent greater than those of large power
plants  (Large, 1973a),  since the rejected heat is utilized in

heating buildings and in industrial processes. If we regard the
quantity of heat liberated in generating the proposed expanded

capacity exclusive of the Douglas point plant, if we assume a 40
percent thermal efficiency and disregard distribution losses,  then

we obtain the following for the total rate of additional useful
energy production in megawatts:</P>



<P>(3732)
x (100/40) x (0.25) = 2330 MW.</P>


<P>The heat component of
this rate of energy production might be seen as an additional

alternative to the electric heating as well as some of the industrial
generating capacity which is the subject of the discussion leading to

relations (4) and (5).</P>
<P>	It is also clear that

some energy saving could result from improved insulation for
residences. Hirst and Moyers  (1972)  estimate that more than 40

percent of the electrical energy of space heating could in this way
be saved. A very conservative estimate would be that space heating

constitutes 24 percent of the electrical power load by analogy with
Table 2. Then if we assume applicability to the proposed growth in

generating capacity exclusive of Douglas Point we obtain:</P>

<P>(3732)

x (0.25) x (0.40) x (0.24) = 90 MW.</P>



<P>If we assume a more

realistic figure of 50 percent for the space heating allotment, this
is more than doubled. However, it should be noted that the energy

saved in this way is considerably less than that saved by avoiding
electric resistance heating. 

</P>
<P>	Savings which may be

realized through architectural improvements have been discussed in
detail by Stein (1972), who found great improvements possible in

larger commercial buildings. In some cases these savings amount to
more than 50 percent in terms of energy consumed for heating,

lighting and air conditioning.</P>
<P>	Although air

conditioning would no longer engender peak yearly loads under the
proposed PEPCO expansion, substantial savings in energy and in summer

generating capacity are possible through increased efficiency. Hirst
and Moyers  (1973)  have compiled statistics which show that the

efficiency of some air conditioners presently marketed range from
less than 5 BTU/watt hr.to 12 BTU/watt hr., with an average of 6

BTU/watt hr. These authors estimate that if the average efficiency
were increased to 10 BTU/watt hr., a saving of 40 percent in

connected load and energy would be achieved on a nationwide basis.
From Table 2 we see that room air conditioning represents 10 percent

of the recent growth in electricity use. The lifetime of a room air
conditioner is about ten years  (Hirst and Moyers, 1973),  so that

most existing air conditioners should be replaced by 1980. From
Figure 1 we note that the projected growth in generating capacity

from 1960 to 1981 exclusive of Douglas point is 6686 MW. Consequently
the potential savings which may be achieved in the residential sector

are:</P>


</P>
<P>6686 x (0.25) x (0.40) x (0.10) = 67 MW.</P>


</P>
<P>If we assume that the

same savings are applicable to both the residential and commercial
sector we obtain:</P>



<P>(6686)
x (0.75) x (0.40) x (0. 10) = 201 MW.</P>



<P>These figures are
however very conservative in terms of total air conditioning savings

in that they do not consider central air conditioning.</P>
<P>	The utilization of

solar energy for space heating and air conditioning is a major
alternative to direct fossil fuel heat and to the growth of

electrical resistance heating. The OEP study  (1972)  indicates that
by 1981  about 40 percent of 13.1 million new households constructed

since 1970 will be electrically heated. Tybot and Lof  (1970) 
calculated that the solar energy falling on the roof of a typical

American house is nearly ten times the space heating demand for such
a house. Furthermore, these authors point out &quot;that the most

suitable areas for solar house heating are those with moderate to
severe heating requirements, abundant sunshine and ideally, heat

needs throughout most of the year.&quot; These are characteristics
which would seem to apply quite well to the Washington Metropolitan

area, which incidentally, is already the site of the famous Thomason
solar heated home  (Large, 1973). </P>

<P>	Altman, Telkes and
Wolf  (1972)  have considered the case of the solar equivalent to the

all-electric heated and air conditioned home. Their study shows that
the substitution  (in new structures)  of solar energy for

all-electric service could save as much as 72 percent of the total
energy when the need for some make-up energy in the solar home is

taken into account. At 34.6 percent efficiency of delivered electric
energy the proposed 3732 MW of added capacity exclusive of Douglas

Point would correspond to a total energy production rate of :</P>

<P>  (3732)  x (100/36.4) = 10,260 MW.</P>
<P>


Electric space

heating accounts for 50 percent of the energy requirements of an
all-electric home. Thus the rate of energy production of a fossil

fuel power plant corresponding to space heating of the residential
sector would be:</P>



<P>(10,206)  x  (0.25)  x  (0.50)  = 1280 MW.</P>

 
 

<P>With the substitution
of solar heating, 70 percent of this, or 896 MW, could be saved.

Additional savings in the rate of heat production and avoidance of
thermal pollution could be achieved by use of solar energy for water

heating and eventually in heating buildings in the large commercial
sector. Also, although the utilization of solar air conditioning in

the summer season would have a smaller effect on the rate of heat
production than does heating, it would provide additional energy

savings. Finally, the moderate costs of solar heating when compared
with other methods has recently been demonstrated by Lof and Tybout (

1973). </P>

<h2>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<ul>
 
 

<P>It is
concluded that there is a critical need to consider energy

conservation as an alternative to nuclear power because:</P>
 

</P>
<OL>

	<LI><P>Nuclear power
	presents serious problems of possible accidents, in fuel

	reprocessing and in the transportation, handling and disposal of
	nuclear wastes.</P>

	<LI><P>The economics and
	energy budget of the nr fuel cycle are doubtful.</P>

	<LI><P>The uranium
	fueled &quot;burner&quot; reactors currently being installed are

	thermally inefficient,  resulting in much local thermal pollution
	and in energy waste. The proliferation of such plants may also add

	dangerously to the regional and planetary heat flux and lead to
	climate modification.</P>

	<LI><P>Because of the
	necessity of isolating nuclear power plants for safety reasons,

	their waste heat cannot be readily reclaimed as in total energy
	systems.</P>

	<LI><P>The wasteful
	&quot;burning&quot; of <SUP>235</SUP>U

	fuel is justified by the anticipated development of the experimental
	breeder reactor, which is highly uncertain.</P>

</OL>
 
<P>The

proposed Douglas Point nuclear power plant has been justified on the
basis of the following needs:</P>

 

<OL>
	<LI><P>new businesses</P>

	<LI><P>appliances</P>
	<LI><P>population growth</P>

	<LI><P>underprivileged
	citizens</P>

	<LI><P>Metro and mass
	transit</P>

	<LI><P>pollution control</P>
	<LI><P>recycling</P>

</OL>
 

</P>
<P>However, analysis

shows that only categories 1, 2 and 3 will make serious demands on
generating capacity. Furthermore, the largest demands are likely to

be from electric resistance heating of &quot;all electric&quot;
buildings in the residential and commercial sectors and from

commercial lighting, should these uses be allowed to grow unchecked.
By contrast, Fig. 1 shows that the demands of population growth are

likely to be much more modest.</P>
<P>	It is proposed that

by the avoidance of electrical resistance heating, by the institution
of more efficient lighting and by modest savings in the industrial

sector, electrical generating capacity equivalent to the proposed
Douglas Point plant could be saved when such energy saving strategies

are applied to the existing and projected capacity <I>exclusive </I>of
Douglas Point. Furthermore, large additional and alternative savings

in energy and generating capacity could result through the use of
solar heating and air conditioning, total energy systems and through

increase efficiency of insulation, appliances and construction
designs.</P>

<P>	Finally, none of the
proposed energy conservation strategies would result in a diminished

standard of living. Rather, energy conservation would lead to a more
livable environment and would probably result in large monetary

savings to consumers.</P>
