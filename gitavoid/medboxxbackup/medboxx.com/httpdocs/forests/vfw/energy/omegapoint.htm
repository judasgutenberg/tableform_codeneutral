<p class="intro">The following is an irreverent expression of the writer's
frustration with the prevailing attitudes toward the environment and the
natural world. In contrast to attitudes in the early 1970s, the period of birth
of the environmental movement, Nature and its on-going rapid destruction now appear

to rank low in the public consciousness and, in many minds, are largely
divorced from the economy. Meanwhile, this economy has risen to new heights of

waste, obsession with short term monetary returns and Nature's exploitation. Equally,

the burgeoning world population and its many social and environmental impacts
is at a low ebb. Comments are invited.

<p>The
Earth is faced with
a multitude of interacting environmental problems that threaten our life
support systems as well as Human culture, and possibly our survival as a
species. The major sources of these problems are Human overpopulation and the
intrusion of this population on Nature's life support systems: atmosphere,
hydrosphere, lithosphere and biosphere. Coupled with overpopulation--and, to
large degree, its impetus-- is the expanding production and use of
technological energy. Additionally, there is a misunderstanding of the nature
of this energy's interaction with the environment, particularly in terms of the

First and Second Laws of thermodynamics. Myths are propagated regarding our
salvation by such ill-defined and deceptive entities as &quot;clean&quot; and

&quot;renewable&quot; energy and &quot;sustainable development.&quot; It is
still widely believed, even among scientists, that, contrary to the Second Law,

it is possible to achieve an overall control of technological energy and its most
familiar form, pollution, while maintaining our present lifestyle. Inevitably,

solutions, such as increased efficiency of existing technologies, that are
proposed for first magnitude problems, such as global warming, are palliative

and inadequate by at least an order of magnitude. There is also a political
inertia that encourages pandering to a populace that maintains this highly

wasteful and self-indulgent lifestyle. Unfortunately, a significant cohort of
influential scientists and economists still supports this dominant political

stance. By contrast, the results of a number of recent studies by more
visionary scientists and economists, as well as those presented here, lead to

the conclusion that the only effective remedial policy is a drastic reduction
in the consumption of energy and the reform of our wasteful economy. Some

suggestions toward achieving this end are presented here. Realistically,
however, it is unlikely that remedial measures that address these problems

directly will be adopted until there are very severe impacts on the environment
and, in particular, on the economy. So far, those raising warning flags have

quickly been tagged as unreasonable &quot;doomsayers&quot; by those who reap
short-term benefits, political, economic or otherwise from the optimistic

status-quo. However, we may hope that the inherent logic of the needed reforms
will prevail as conditions worsen.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<ul>
 

<p>It
is likely that time--even short time--is not on the side of our present culture.
Human driven planetary changes will probably soon force the issue. A number of authors, among them Ehrlich  (1971), Georgescu-Roegen (1975), Catton (1982), Price (1995) and  Diamond (2004),
have discussed this subject in depth. Most of these authors are scientists, and
their conclusions are based on well documented scientific studies, although
economics also plays an important role. Indeed, we appear to have little choice
but to turn to science and economics for solutions, if any are attainable. An
attempt is made here to further explore the problem from a largely energy-centered
approach, with particular regard for the constraints placed on our choices by
thermodynamics. </p>


 
</ul>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<ul>
 

<p>The
central problem faced by our culture is the impact of our species' overpopulation,
and the intrusion of this population on nature's realm. Included in the latter
are coastlines, the remnants of natural forests, grasslands, deserts, wetlands
and waters worldwide. Coastlines and shores are increasingly developed for
human habitation or intensive recreation, and are thus irreparably damaged and denied
to some of our rarest wildlife, which require them for their very existence. Increasingly
also, there are repercussions, such as added vulnerability of Human property
and lives to storms. Forests are fragmented and degraded by roads and logging,
natural grasslands are converted to agricultural land, with losses in topsoil;
desert vegetation is browsed by domestic flocks until only sand remains, and
wetlands are filled with little appreciation of their critical hydrologic and
ecological functions. The most remote deep ocean areas are impacted by
indiscriminate fishing, which is driving to extinction many non-target
organisms such as marine turtles, seabirds and sea mammals. At the same time,
in shallow waters and bays, installations, like shrimp and salmon farms,
eliminate vital spawning areas, such as mangrove forests, for wild marine life,
while they soil the water with nutrients and waste products. As a consequence
of these factors and over-fishing, many fisheries have declined or collapsed. And
as background to all this is the steadily increasing burden and diversity of
chemical pollutants that find their way into the atmosphere, rivers, lakes,
oceans and the human bloodstream itself. Even the
remotest Polar air masses, ice fields, and fauna now bear these chemicals. Among
the latest revelations are the impacts of global warming, which, although not
settled as entirely human-caused, has for years been known to follow from the
increasing values of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the industrial era. Because
world per-capita energy use has nearly doubled since 1950 (Dorf,1981), this trend will be difficult to interrupt let alone
reverse. Perhaps the ultimate threat, although remote, is that of a run-away
greenhouse effect by which the entire planet might be rendered uninhabitable.
Already, rapidly evolving consequences include the dramatic shrinking of ice
fields and glaciers, the rise in ocean water levels, the loss of coral reefs, and
the increasing power and frequency of hurricanes and other storms. Likely
recent specific examples are the unprecedented high temperatures in many parts
of the world, and in the  US,
the catastrophic Gulf Coast
hurricanes, widespread late season tornados and Western and Midwestern severe
droughts and fires. All of these phenomena are in the process of documentation
and are the subjects of almost daily up-dates. It seems likely that many other
currently unanticipated detrimental effects of human culture and technology
will emerge in the near future.</p>
<p>Not
discussed here are the problems associated with nuclear energy, such as
potential military uses, nuclear proliferation and the problem of waste
storage, to name a few. Generally, however, the gravity of nuclear problems is
more widely appreciated than that of those listed above. Certainly they
contribute to and further enhance the urgency of the latter.</p>
<p>There is a point of view that
holds that Human culture can continue to flourish despite the distress and loss
of natural ecosystems, because technology will set us free. For these people ecosystems
count for little, and the focus is almost entirely on resources used by Humans,
which are claimed to be infinite or nearly so  (e.g.
Simon, 1996). Increasingly this hope is being shown to be a vain one, partly,
I believe, as a consequence of issues to be raised in this piece, but by a
multitude of other issues as well. It is expressed by the popular ecological
saying that &quot;everything is connected to everything else.&quot; or &quot;We
can never do merely one thing.&quot;  (Hardin, 1993). 
</p>

<p> A single
theme unites all the above-mentioned examples of environmental degradation.
This is the accompanying growth in energy use with that of population. Energy
is generally considered a great boon to our existence, and its continued rapid--
if not unlimited--growth is assumed necessary for our future wellbeing. This virtually
unquestioned belief has even invested much of science. In the words of Cambel  (1970) :</p>

<p>&quot;The
solution to the conflict between energy and the environment must not be in
curtailing energy supply, but in reducing the irreversible and dissipative
effects when we convert and consume energy.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course
energy is implicit in all events, in everything we do or ever did, including
our mental activity. All that benefits and inspires us in
nature runs on energy. Most conspicuous is the energy from the Sun that
brings us comfort and fuels the plant world through photosynthesis. Our use and
conversion of Nature's energy forms through technology also benefits us, but at
a price. Unlike Nature's own energy conversions, such as occur in photosynthesis,
many technological energy forms have come on the scene so rapidly, and in such
great diversity, that Nature can adapt to them only with great difficulty, if
at all. </p>

<p>Energy
has the properties of quantity and quality, where quantity is measured 
in  some established
unit such as the calorie, and quality refers to the extent to which a
particular energy form is useful and lacking in harmful effects on Nature and Humans.
As a general rule, quality decreases with use. Thus the high quality electrical
energy that runs a motor is, on use, quickly converted, not only to useful
mechanical energy, but also to useless and even harmful energy
forms embodied in noise, heat of friction and wear products such as metallic
dust. The extent to which an energy conversion is useful to Humans is its
efficiency.  For example, modern electric
power plants usually have an efficiency of a little. more than 30 percent, and
most of the original fuel energy ends up as thermal pollution. The efficiency
of heat engines such as this is limited by the fundamental laws of
thermodynamics, although even this degree of efficiency is seldom if ever
attained. Energy degrades to useless and harmful forms at every step of use or
conversion. Thus, when the 30 percent useful energy produced by a power plant

is used to run an electric motor, only a part, albeit a large part, ends up as
useful mechanical 

energy, while the rest is lost as identified above. Of course,
the mechanical energy, which may be used to drive a machine, is then also

degraded in this machine as frictional heat and other waste forms. Thus, energy,
such as that derived from wind, may seem &quot;clean&quot; when generated, but

quickly becomes &quot;dirty&quot; when used and disposed of. A good argument
can be made that when technological energy interacts with the environment and

organisms, it behaves as a pollutant, and that in fact all pollutants are so by
virtue of their energy content  (Mueller,1971, 1972,
1976; also, see our section &quot;<a href=.>Energy in a Real World</a>&quot;). </p>
<p>A
characteristic of all energy transformations is their spontaneity.
Consequently, there can in general be no technological &quot;control&quot; of
energy, or by extension, pollution, without the introduction of more energy, a
conclusion based on the Second Law of thermodynamics. Thus, reducing the
&quot;irreversible and dissipative effects&quot; of energy conversion and use,
as suggested by Cambel, is in general not possible
without introducing other irreversible and dissipative effects. The use of
technological energy is essentially an attempt to order the local environment,
or what is synonymous, decrease the entropy. However, according to the Second Law,
the order of the environment as a whole  (universe) 
must decrease and the entropy increase, in any spontaneous transformation. One
consequence is that the same lifestyles will run on the same mix of energy and
hence produce the same pollutants, regardless of the source of that energy. In
sum, virtually all human actions have unintended consequences for the
environment, and the only way to moderate--let alone overcome-- this problem,
is to substitute low for high energy processes in our daily lives where this is
possible (Mueller, 1971). An excellent recent overview of the role of entropy
in Human affairs has been provided by Hokikian 
 (2002). </p>


<p>The
examples of Human impacts on Nature listed above are not only characterized by
energy-based unintended consequences, but are defined by them, since there is no

way to conduct the activities which cause them without such consequences.
Because all energy is eventually dissipated into the natural environment as

various forms of pollution, there are limits to the quantity of energy that can
be assimilated without lasting damage to ecosystems. Since such damage now

appears to be occurring, it is essential that we slow and eventually decrease
this energy flux.</p>


<p>All this
does not of course, preclude the use of careful planning (which may take relatively little energy!), as represented by administrative
acts, by which energy expenditure may be greatly reduced. In many cases such

low energy paths of action will, however, entail inconveniences, as in the
substitution of public for private transportation, or as in the conversion to a

vegetarian diet (Pimentel
and Pimentel, 1996). Actually, a vegetarian, or rather a near vegetarian diet,

would, in all probability, turn out to be more convenient than one based on
meat and fish, as well as having many health benefits.</p>


<p>At present
virtually all planning for the necessary cultural transition is mired 
in  standards which
seek to preserve the existing &quot;level of comfort&quot; while eliminating

the unintended consequences-in the manner of Cambel.
This problem not only extends to the highest ranks of government advisory

bodies and their scientists but particularly characterizes them. Since the
problems of energy in the environment first emerged, there has developed a craft

of utterances and committees that amount to a &quot;survival of the unfittest.&quot; In them there

is a play on terminology as well as actions that are designed to serve the
needs of pandering politicians. The first rule is that there be

little or no effect on the lifestyles of voters; the second is that the
ultimate outcome will be favorable to the existing society. In this world view

there has developed a cheerful and complacent terminology, examples being
&quot;clean energy&quot;, &quot;renewable energy&quot;, &quot;sustainable

development&quot; and &quot;pollution control.&quot; It's true that the
scientific pundits, up to and including members of the National Academy of

Sciences, say many of the &quot;right&quot; things, that, if acted upon, would
at least amount to token improvements to our planetary dilemma. There is, for

example, considerable support for the Kyoto Protocol, which is designed to
reduce the rate of global warming, and is weak enough to have some chance of eventually

being adopted even by our politicians.</p>


<p>At this
point it is informative to consider specific examples. <a href=http://bcsia.ksg.harvard.edu/ target=belfer>The Belfer Center

for Science and International Affairs</a>  (BCSIA) of  Harvard 
  University  is one of the most

prestigious and influential institutions in the matter of energy policy.
Prominent in the BCSIA,  the Harvard faculty, and now

also as the Director of the Woods Hole
Research Center

is Professor John Holdren. Recipient of numerous
honors, including membership in the  National 

 Academy, Prof. Holdren
has written extensively on energy policy, both as sole author and with other

experts as coauthors. The writer remembers Prof. Holdren
from the early 1970s, when he wrote requesting copies of the NASA documents on

energy cited here. For an insight into his thinking we consider his article
&quot;<a href=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/291/5506/945 target=meeting>Meeting the Energy Challenge</a>&quot;  (Holdren, 2001). The article begins with:</p>


<p>&quot;Affordable energy in ample quantities is the
lifeblood of the industrial societies and a prerequisite for the development of
the others....Energy may also be the most intractable element of the world's

environmental problems. This is because energy's effluents drive many of the
most dangerous environmental problems at every scale  (from

the health impacts of woodsmoke in Third
 World village huts to the disruption of global climate by

anthropogenic greenhouse gasses) and because the energy system characteristics
at fault are often costly and time-consuming to change.&quot;</p>

 
 And later: 
 
<p>&quot;Meeting these challenges will require increased
efforts to maximize the capabilities and minimize the liabilities of the full
array of energy options: improvements in the end-use energy efficiency in

vehicles, residences and industries; renewable energy sources; advanced fossil
fuel and nuclear fission technologies; and nuclear fusion. There is no silver

bullet in this array nor are there any that we can be confident we can do
without.&quot;</p>


<p>Also in <i><a href=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=507321 target=holdreN2>FOCUS:
Energy Technology for Sustainable Development</a></i> (Holdren, 2005b) we read that:</p>


<p>&quot;Energy is responsible for most indoor and outdoor
air pollution, most of the acidification of rainfall caused by human
activities, most of the oil polluting the seas, most radioactive waste, and much

of the environmental burden of trace metals.&quot;</p>


<p>A
superficial reading of these statements in the context of popular opinion would
classify them as quite reasonable and positive. The least we can say about them

is that they are in harmony with  those of Cambel

thirty years earlier. The need to &quot;maximize the capabilities and minimize
the liabilities&quot; fits the pattern. There is, despite Prof. 
Holdren's impressive credentials, an apparent lack of
understanding, or at least a mind-slip, regarding 
  the nature of energy and entropy and their
roles in the environment, as typified  by

the above paragraph beginning with &quot;Affordable energy&quot; and the quote
from the FOCUS article. And he must have disagreed with the NASA documents or

at least not read them carefully! In Prof. Holdren's
mind energy is regarded as simply one element, albeit an important one, in the

array of environmental problems. However, on careful reflection it is difficult
to list an environmental problem in which energy doesn't have a critical role. This

is true because nothing happens without energy transformations. And as a
consequence of the Second Law, energy, in conjunction with entropy, not only

makes things happen but limits severely our ability to control or predict the
consequences of its release in our service. And Prof. Holdren

appears to be totally sold on the concept of energy control.</p>


<p>If
&quot;lifeblood&quot; is an apt description of energy in industrial societies,
it raises some serious questions. In successful organisms a lifeblood

needs to retain its integrity, or the organism it nourishes will die. Its
wastes must be recycled and eliminated without harm to the organism. By

contrast, technological energy is on use continuously transformed and degraded,
and its wastes accumulate as toxins in the form of pollutants. The gasoline

burned in an automobile, as well as the fuel and materials used in the car's
manufacture, end up debilitating us with a thousand pollutants. Thus energy's

ultimate &quot;affordability&quot; as well, is in question from the start. In any
case, there is no need to minimize a lifeblood, but ample reason to minimize

our use of energy. By contrast, Prof. Holdren
Apparently believes that such primary targets of efficient technology, as the

automobile, can, by the latest tinkerings and conversions,
be turned into a real counter force to global warming and energy waste--

without, however, any consideration of the total technology or its societal
underpinnings.</p>


<p>For a
further insight into Prof. Holdren's thinking we may

turn to his statement for the Clean Coal Conference, held in March, 2005  (Holdren, 2005a).  It

begins:</p>


<p>&quot;This country needs to expand coal use for
electricity generation and for reducing dependence on oil and natural gas in
other applications. But it also needs to take serious steps to reduce the risks

from climate change. Reconciling these two objectives requires a three-pronged
approach, as recommended in the recent report of the bipartisan National

Commission on Energy Policy that I had the privilege of co-chairing.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;The first prong is to provide a market signal that
begins to slow the growth of carbon emissions, but at a pace that doesn't force
premature retirement of existing coal-fired generating capacity.&quot; </p>


<p>&quot;The second prong is speeding up the
commercialization of integrated gasification-combined-cycle multipurpose coal

plants, which can produce liquid and gaseous fuels as well as electricity,
which sharply reduce emissions of criteria air pollutants and which offer the

potential for affordable retrofit to capture CO<sub>2</sub>.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;The third prong is accelerating the development and
commercial-scale demonstration of carbon capture and sequestration technologies
needed to realize the potential of IGCC plants to drastically and affordably

reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.&quot;</p>


<p>This statement
illustrates well the chain of influence in a disastrous energy policy, a policy
heavy on belated long range planning and safe &quot;concern&quot; about climate

change. Technologies mentioned in the three prongs are not likely to come on
line for years if at all, and there is nothing about their</i> environmental impacts. But people and the environment are
suffering greatly today, and have long suffered from pollutants emanating from

coal and its destructive mining practices. The time of publication-2005- is
important here. Most glaring today, for example, is the practice of mountain

top removal / valley-fill mining in Appalachia, which
not only deforms the landscape on a colossal scale and extinguishes headwater

streams, but also pollutes rivers to their mouths. Clearly in violation of the
Clean Water Act and a number of other environmental laws, these methods of

mining are propped up by corrupted administrators and courts. They are also
bolstered by expert endorsements such as the above. They could probably be

ended with little effect on energy supplies, jobs or prices. Although these
abuses have been practiced for some years, Prof. Holdren's

concern seems to be dominated by the &quot;need&quot; to increase energy
supplies without any questioning of this need in terms of life style, or even

mention of the terrible abuses that mining and coal use entail. </p>


<p>The
perfunctory and trite nature of Prof. Holdren's
responses to these urgent environmental problems is the more surprising given

his early collaboration with Paul Ehrlich  (e g.
Ehrlich and Holdren, 1971). </p>


<p>As
indicated earlier, the Belfer Center of Harvard and
Prof. Holdren are perhaps only the most prominent of

expert energy planners. Perhaps the most important characteristic of this
select cohort is &quot;credibility&quot;. They must be recognized as experts

and not &quot;kooks&quot;, with the implied definition of the latter term as referring
to one oblivious to achievable goals. Another group that bears a certain aura

of credibility is the Union of Concerned Scientists. The UCS is a
science-centered environmental group. Unlike advisory groups such as the 
  Belfer Center,
the UCS depends more on advocacy that concentrates on informing the public

through its publications, web site etc. and thereby influencing this public to exert
pressure on politicians. This organization provides much useful information and

many services in alerting the public to environmentally destructive activities
of industry and governments as well as related legislation. However, like the 
  Belfer Center
and similar establishment instruments, emphasis is almost entirely on

increasing energy production, but with stress on &quot;clean&quot; and
&quot;renewable&quot; forms. Suggestions to individuals involve little

sacrifice and can result in only mild life style modifications. Thus there is
no indication of leadership in meaningful energy conservation or any analysis

of the required thermodynamic factors. </p>


<p>Assumptions are made by the UCS that certain
energy forms such as wind, solar, biomass etc are &quot;clean&quot; without

discussions of their negative production features and their inevitable
transformation to pollutants on use. Also, the likely impact of these energy

forms on supply is exaggerated. In one example the perennial native, Switchgrass  (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>), 

is touted as biomass fuel for a large electric power plant in Iowa.
Plans call for planting 50,000 acres in this grass for this purpose. It would

provide 5 percent of the plant's fuel at a profit of $40 per acre for farmers  (&quot;Clean Energy&quot;, UCS Web Site, 2005).  It is

however difficult to visualize tying up 50,000 acres of rich farm land for such
a low return per acre! In the case of wind power and similar &quot;clean&quot;

technologies, tax revenues to rural jurisdictions are used as an additional
selling point, without mentioning that such revenues result from all technological

development, including the most pollution prone. In fact, another uncertainty
is introduced by touting &quot;high-paying&quot; job promotion of renewable

energy development. As was shown by Hannon  (1975) 
and Herendeen  (1973),  there is an almost linear relation

between total consumer  (family)  energy utilization and income, so that
regardless of social stratum, total energy use, and hence pollution production,

rises directly with income. As we have seen, there is no reason to believe
that, given  current life styles, income

from renewable energy production is any less pollution prone than that from
other sources. </p>


<p>In a late
development the UCS heaps lavish praise on the Ford Motor Corp. for &quot;a

leadership role in the reduction and stabilization of global warming pollutants&quot;
by promoting hybrid cars. In view of all the highly pollution prone vehicles

Ford currently produces, do either they or the UCS expect to be taken
seriously?! In any case, all such palliative tinkering does little but

encourage &quot;feel good&quot; attitudes. Global warming is the result of
massive energy expenditures through generations, and it is likely that only

corresponding energy cut-backs can be effective in even slowing, let alone
reversing it! Nonetheless, one is torn between
  necessary criticism of organizations
such as the UCS and a fear of jeopardizing some highly useful functions they

perform.</p>


<p>Another organization that is in
the forefront of influencing the public on the energy-environment problem is

the Worldwatch Institute. Founded in 1974 by Lester
Brown, both Brown and the Institute deserve much credit for introducing a broad

spectrum of people to the most pressing global problems, ranging from diseases
to war. As is the case with our two previous examples, the tone and approach is

generally up-beat with respect to the future role of technology and energy in
society. According to the <a href=http://www.worldwatch.org/about/ target=ww>Worldwatch website</a>, they

seek to provide a &quot;blend of interdisciplinary research, global focus, and
accessible writing&quot;, and work that &quot;revolves around the transition to

an environmentally sustainable and socially just society.&quot; Exhaustive and
exhausting detail are provided on the latest developments of &quot;green&quot;

forms of energy, with particular emphasis on the economics of development, and
the boon to humanity of these energy forms is usually considered a given. Very

little attention is given to thermodynamics, the Second Law in particular, and
what happens to energy after use. Consequently people are left with the

impression that a &quot;hydrogen economy&quot; is inevitable, and that this
element is a viable and clean fuel &quot;source&quot;, when, in fact, rather

than being made available, much energy is absorbed and much pollution generated
in freeing hydrogen from other elements, to which it is bound very firmly. It

also goes without saying that little attention is given to the energy drain by
pollution control technologies themselves and their affluent practitioners, or

indeed to the total </i>energy
inventories required by the Second Law.</p>


<p>Indeed, one
of the most important contribution of the UCS and 
Worldwatch may be in providing an exhaustive list of all
the energy forms masquerading as &quot;green&quot;, with then-presented opportunities

for their systematic dissection via the Second Law!</p>


<p>One final
instance of  an
organizations with  blue-sky faith in

technology is The Rocky Mountain Institute. An example is their proposed &quot;hypercar&quot;  (<a href=http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid386.php target=hyper>see their website</a>), a gaseous hydrogen powered vehicle designed by the Institute's founder,
Amory Lovins. This vehicle would, according to an

institute promo, &quot;virtually eliminate automobile pollution.&quot; With
such a cheerful message, little wonder that the

Institute is well funded-- presumably by those who know little of the Second
Law. There is little evidence, for example, that any account is taken of the

energy and resource demands, and pollution that would be produced, by the
complex technology and the social infrastructure that would, of necessity, 
undergird such a vehicle. It is, however, a great bait for the hopelessly naive! </p>


<p>Since we know that all energy forms, even

&quot;clean&quot; forms, are spontaneously transformed to &quot;dirty&quot;
forms through the Second Law, our energy impact problems will never be solved

to any meaningful degree as long as energy use -any form of energy use-
increases without bound. This doesn't mean that increased efficiency is of no

benefit, but simply that it can never overcome an overall increase in energy
use. Thus, the most modern and efficient vehicles will never solve pollution

problems associated with transportation as long as the number of such vehicles
and their necessary infrastructure remain large. One reason for this is the

spontaneous degradation of even the most useful components of the energy needed
to operate such vehicles, while another is the virtual impossibility of

exerting any significant control over the supporting infrastructure. Let's assume the impossible, that all our machines achieve 100 percent

efficiency, so they produce only useful energy. However, by the First Law, this
energy cannot be gotten rid of after use, and by the Second Law it will all be

spontaneously degraded into pollutants or other forms, over which we have no
control, except by introducing more energy from the outside. And all this takes

no account of the existing prodigal waste of the current life style, which
occurs independently of any machine efficiency. It must be recognized that the

only truly clean technological energy is that saved through conservation. The UCS
speaks of &quot;Shifting America  to Clean, Affordable, and Safe Renewable

Energy.&quot; But there is a conflict here between a wasteful society that must
be catered to with &quot;affordable energy&quot; and the reality that this

society will probably not reduce energy use, and become less wasteful and
pollution prone, unless constrained by less</i>

affordable energy. This is why technological efficiency improvements can never
solve emerging problems such as global warming, although they may contribute in

a minor way.</p>


<p>If we
return to our introductory list of environmental abuses, one of a number of energy
involvements is immediately obvious, an involvement that would be derided by current

politicians-namely the low price of energy. Destructive coastal development is
largely a consequence of artificially cheap energy, which is needed to sustain

this development. Cheap energy also lies behind the overexploitation of forests
and fisheries, subsidized agriculture in unsuitable locations, ecologically

destructive road building, with excessive dependence on vehicles, the careless
use and disposal of chemicals, and indeed, virtually every environmental abuse

by Humans. It's uncertain, however, whether these negative interpretations of
energy involvement in environmental problems would be accepted or even

recognized by Prof. Holdren and his colleagues, given
their concern with &quot;affordable energy.&quot; </p>


</ul>

<h2>What can be done?</h2>

<b>(blueprint  for a lifestyle?)</b></p>


<ul>

<p>
What, in addition to population

reduction, can be done to rescue the planet's life support systems and Human
high culture-or are the two incompatible? The first thing we must recognize is that

we don't have a realistic world economy. As our most perceptive economists (e.g. Beers, 1970; Boulding, 1968;Georgescu-Roegen,

1975; Olson and Cumberland, 1970)  have long pointed out, the prices of goods,
and most particularly energy, are too low to reflect their cost to the

ecosystems that produce them and those which must assimilate their waste
products. And our current economy-which has enshrined former long-time Federal

Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan as a
national hero-is almost entirely based on waste, to the detriment of future

generations. In the words of Georgescu-Roegen  (1975) : </p>


<p>&quot;This is why in bioeconomics
we must emphasize that every Cadillac or every Zim--let

alone any instrument of war--means fewer plowshares for some future
generations, and implicitly, fewer human beings.&quot;</p>


<p>As indicated previously, energy

prices are most significant in this regard because they enter into virtually
all impacts on ecosystems. However, energy prices that increase in response to lowered

supplies produce hardships which fall disproportionately on poor people. Since saving
most ecosystems would seem to require a drastic decrease in energy use, and

since this use largely consists of waste, a strong conservation program is
warranted. However, for such a program to be fair, relief would be required for

the poor. This could be accomplished through energy tax revenues providing
subsidies proportional to income deficits rising above a certain value. Frequently

energy taxes are proposed so the revenues raised may be used to promote forms
of energy regarded as &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;renewable&quot;. However, as

we have seen, these terms are not rigorously correct, since all energy forms
undergo spontaneous transformations to other forms and eventually degrade to a

variety of pollutants, also spontaneously. Consequently emphasis must be on
reducing total energy use regardless of form. A better alternative or

additional use of energy tax revenues would be the protection and restoration
of natural areas, since such areas require a minimal input of technological energy

for their maintenance  (Mueller, 1971)  and increase
the ecological health of the Earth.</p>


<p>However, such measures as taxing energy directly should be regarded as minimal steps in

reaching an accommodation with Nature. Rather, it is likely that more draconian
measures will be required. These may take the form of regulating the size and

location of dwellings. Living space in the U S might be limited to 1000 sq. ft.
per four people as an example  (the writer's family,

ranging from 3-4 persons, has for the last 30 years lived in a 700 sq. ft.
dwelling without sacrificing comfort).  One of the most important actions that

could be taken is the conversion from our present transport-dependant, animal
product-centered diet to a vegetarian or near vegetarian diet (practiced by the

writer),  based on locally grown products. Water use,
now so profligate, might be restricted, with particular emphasis on hot water 
 (ditto by the writer),  since the large heat capacity of
water demands enormous amounts of energy for even modest heating. Daily or even

less frequent baths and clothing changes, which require much warm water, can
easily be done away with without significant diminution of cleanliness. This

may be accomplished without any ill health effects and might even benefit
health, since too frequent washing probably deprives the skin of protective

oils and a beneficial microflora, while it exposes
the body to unnatural chemicals. Enormous amounts of fuel energy, chemicals,
water and other resources could be saved by doing away with artificial

ornamental vegetation such as lawns and formal gardens and substituting native
ground cover  (long ago adopted by the writer).  This

would also benefit native wildlife, cut pollution, and have great educational
value for children, who are increasingly alienated from Nature. Another way to

work with Nature,  with substantial savings in energy
and materials, would be to return to such practices as drying washing in the

sun. In the period of abundant energy, Humans developed a prodigal and
frequently mindless passion for travel  (largely given up by the writer, who 
  has owned one new car in 65 years of driving), 
especially by auto and air, which are very energy intensive and dump great amounts

of pollutants into the atmosphere, waters and on the land. While energy taxes
might curtail some travel, additional measures might be required. </p>


<p>A little
appreciated source of energy savings and environmental protection, which meshes

well with all the foregoing suggestions, is so-called &quot;menial&quot; work.  Defined as any utilitarian physical activity that generally

dispenses with technology more complex than hand tools, it substitutes
elemental food energy for a variety of power-driven tools and thus produces

largely Nature-compatible waste. It saves energy in many ways: <p>
1) in the
design, manufacture, purchase, servicing and replacement of complex machines
<br>
2) in the
protection of space needed to store these machines and <br>
3) in fuels. <p>
While

additional food energy is required for hard manual work, it is no more than is
required for brisk exercise. In any case, the energy involved would

overwhelmingly be expended no matter what. Additionally, such activity as
housework, manual gardening and a variety of practical manual activities are

excellent balances for sedentary intellectual activity. Perhaps one of the
greatest benefits of manual work is that it can enhance physical and mental acuity

and health, which in turn saves energy, a variety of scarce resources, time  and money. The

exploitation of this form of practical physical activity, which was the basis
of pre-industrial economies in many parts of the world, receives generally bad

marks, since it has always been thought that leaving this life style behind was
one of modern society's greatest benefits. It could however save enormous

amounts of energy and resources in developed countries and do more to counter
global warming and general environmental degradation than many conceivable changes

in technology. And these suggestions are only a beginning. Of course most
people in our wasteful and self-indulgent society find these activities

unpleasant and almost instinctively retrogressive. Some  (e.
g. Price, 1995)  have warned that high culture and an active intellectual life

are incompatible with a reversion to a simpler life style. But this assumption
is probably based on the past course of human cultural development, which

entailed the invention  of cultural
elements, whereas we can now start with many high cultural elements already in

place.</p>


<p>There are
examples that illustrate that our modern innovations are not always either the
most energy efficient or convenient. An example from the writer's personal life

involves shaving his full beard, now for more than 25 years. The instrument is
an ancient safety razor that uses double-edged blades. These blades are

manually sharpened against the wetted interior of a 3.5 inch diameter glass
tumbler. During all the time this razor has been in use, less than a half dozen

blades--really perhaps only 3 or 4-- were employed. While the quality of the
shave varies a bit, the result is generally as good as that provided by the

most expensive instruments. Its use is as convenient as can be imagined, and it
requires practically no care or servicing. It will be left to the reader to

estimate the energy and materials saved by this &quot;retrograde&quot;
instrument. Other examples could be cited in which simple hand tools are as

effective in executing a task as power tools, with substantial savings in
energy and resources, all the while providing healthy exercise that might

otherwise be paid for in a gym!</p>


<p>Although
adoption of the life style elements discussed above might be encouraged through
motivational education and artificial incentives, they would likely be

automatically adopted in an economy of scarcity brought on by environmental
threats and high energy prices. However,

it goes without saying that the transition from our present economy of waste to
one demanded by our long term survival, would be painful for many and might

even result in social unrest  (Price, 1995).  Part of
the problem relates to the severe economic readjustments that would be required

as a result of the diminution of consumption, since it is said that two-thirds
of the  US 

economy is based on consumer purchases. It is necessary and easy to say we must
cut back on our use of energy, but an emphasis on conservation over energy

production doesn't sit well even with the latter's   most pitiful victims. Rather, they feel more

forceful arguments must be made for energy alternatives to the form from which
they suffer. Hopefully, enough time will be available for a graceful transition

to a life style required by the circumstances.   Realistically however, it seems unlikely that

there will be significant remedial reform until conditions become so severe as
to threaten economic life or the lives of many real persons. As in the past,

anyone who spells out the consequences of the existing system is likely
immediately to be labeled an irresponsible &quot;doomsayer&quot; by those who

have a vested interest in either the economic or political status-quo. This is
why planning for the transition can't start too early.</p>


<p>As a
beginning, what is needed is enough of a reality check to recognize the gravity

of our present situation. For politicians this should take the form of having
enough courage to ask for sacrifices on the part of everyone, as was done by

President Roosevelt during World War II, the only recent emergency comparable
to the current threats to the Earth. For scientists it means transcending

denial and the seduction of the deep comfort zone in which inhabitants of the
most technologically advanced nations now exist. Although their own research

may point to planetary catastrophe, these scientists are themselves immersed in
the same lifestyle as everyone else. They too may have summer homes on seashores

or lakes that are easy to rationalize as contributions to their professional
productivity, while a fast car may seem as a small enough reward for all the

nights spent slaving in a laboratory.</p>


<p>What is
important is that we immediately enter into a realistic discussion of the
issues raised above. We need to repudiate, or at least provide alternatives to scientific,

economic and political leadership that entertains and promotes a rosy world
view and props up the existing dominant lifestyle of self-indulgent waste. We

need to expose the pundits of the Belfer
 Center, the Union of Concerned

Scientists, Worldwatch and the energy establishment
in general for their lack of courage and for pandering to the basest instincts

of the public. Central here is the recognition of the true nature of energy,
once released, as largely beyond Human control, except through restricted

rather than expanded use, and the identity of virtually all technological
energy with pollution. Also needed are further studies in the nature of the

1972 Report to the Club of Rome, <i>The
Limits to Growth,</i> by Donella H. Meadows <i>et al </i> (1972). 
</p>


<p>We could
also use a little moral authority from the devout, which is expended so

lavishly on lesser urgencies. According to the popular media Pope Benedict has
recently spoken out against &quot;environmental destruction.&quot; Since we

know that over-consumption and ostentatious life styles contribute to the problem,
the Pope might well set an example by adopting humbler and more frugal habits,

beginning with foregoing his gold cape and miter, followed by encouraging his
subordinates to adopt personal forms of self-denial. He might also drop his

objection to family planning!</p>


<p>A word of
caution is also needed. Among the gloomiest  scenarios for the fate of our planet

are the previously mentioned Population
Bomb </i> (1971)  by Paul R. Ehrlich and Energy

and Human Evolution</i>  (1995)  by David Price. A number of the dire
predictions of Ehrlich's book proved to be so far off the mark that they led to

widespread ridicule by environmental optimists  (e.g.
Simon, 1996). Similarly, Price's 1995 prediction that &quot;A collapse of the

earth's human population cannot be more than a few years away.&quot; was probably
equally rash. Yet, while these errors of timing point to the foolhardiness of

the prediction game, their subjects are as threatening
as ever. The issues raised by these authors were and are timely, and we are indebted

for their vision, expertise and public spiritedness in bringing them to light.
It must be remembered that certainty is as impossible in science as it is in

every-day life. It is this very uncertainty that demands that the identification
and exposure of planetary threats be taken seriously, and that it is better to

err on the side of caution, because there is always the possibility that the
reality of the threats may turn out to be more severe than anything we can

envision. However, views such as those expressed by this reporter should also
be read with caution. Both Humans and Nature in general are adaptable and

resilient, and the knowledge of science, coupled with a new-found humility, may
yet rescue both us and this beautiful planet.</p>
