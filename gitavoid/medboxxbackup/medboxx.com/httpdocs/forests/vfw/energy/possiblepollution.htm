<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 <ul>
<P>	The driving force of
active pollutants of any kind results from their excess free energy
relative to their innocuous degradation products<SUP>1</SUP>. The
great variety of industrial processes and pollutants results in the
statistical equivalence with respect to degree of deleteriousness of
various technological energy sources in their utilization and
dissipation modes, and this deleteriousness depends on the total
culture. Thus, &quot;clean&quot; energy sources such as solar energy
ultimately give rise to the same distribution of pollutants as
&quot;dirty&quot; sources. Similarly, the concepts of &quot;soft&quot;
and &quot;hard&quot; energy paths have no meaning in a thermodynamic
sense. 
</P>
<P>	Because all
thermodynamically possible technological processes must be utterly
spontaneous in sum, there can be no overall control of energy or the
equivalent pollution. In the installation of pollution control
equipment this takes the form of an additional increment of energy
and hence pollution, which is added to that already resulting from
the primary industrial process. Thus, any control exercised over
local pollution generally results in pollution elsewhere.</P>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <ul>
</P>
<P>	This piece might just
as well have been entitled &quot;Is it Possible to Control Energy?&quot;
Certainly the connection between energy and pollution, seemingly
misunderstood or at least obscured, in one way or another, lies
behind the plethora of problems that are actively eroding the
benefits of modern technology and are calling this technology itself

into question. This state of affairs has encouraged the growth of
unscientific myths, which not only have captured the public

consciousness, but continue to be spread by the highest scientific
authorities, and most particularly by those in the ranks of

technological optimists<SUP>2</SUP>. Anticipate then that I regard
the &quot;control&quot; of energy and pollution by technologic means

as one of these myths, which Cambel<SUP>3</SUP> conveniently phrased
as follows:</P>

 

<P>	&quot;The solution to
the conflict between energy and the environment must not be in

curtailing energy supply, but in reducing the irreversible and
dissipative effects when we convert and consume energy.&quot;</P>

 

<P>	Or, in what is in part
a corollary to this viewpoint, no less than a presidential science

advisor<SUP>4 </SUP>stated:</P>
 
</P>
<P>	&quot;We know that

some time in the next century we will achieve a virtually unlimited,
renewable and clean energy supply.&quot;</P>

 

<P>	Even
energy-environment specialists have joined in. However Odum<SUP>5</SUP>

expressed some ambivalence when he wrote:</P>
 
 
<P>	&quot;With new, rich

energy flows man can control and manage enormous quantities of the
world's energy. <I>Increasingly he is affecting the whole biosphere.</I>&quot;

 (italics added) </P>
 

<P>	It is not my aim here
to argue that control of energy and pollution on even a quite large

scale is precluded, although this may well be the case. It is also
well to clarify that what is meant here is control through

technology, which is quite a different thing from the obvious methods
of administrative control. We have, on the basis of limited evidence,

no reason to doubt the instances in which control technologies are
said to have resulted in notable improvements in substantial air and

water masses. For example, the Presidents Council on Environmental
Quality has documented recent decreases in concentration of carbon

monoxide and other toxic air pollutants in a number of American
cities as a result of emission controls. Also, concentrations of such

water pollution indicators as coliform bacteria and oxygen-demanding
materials have shown decreases in some streams after sewage treatment

was upgraded. Other examples could be cited<SUP>6 </SUP>. However,
these technological success stories only highlight the question of

the efficacy of technology in solving problems which it gave rise to
in the first place and which require inputs of additional energy. We

should always bear in mind the simple logic that it takes energy to
control energy. In any case, the appalling scale of certain emerging

pollution problems such as acid rain and toxic organic chemicals
should make us suspicious that local controls conceal larger regional

effects.</P>
<P>	It is clear that if

our local pollution control efforts, be they yet so successful, do
not result in an overall decrease of pollution in qualitative and

quantitative terms, or result in a worsening of global conditions,
they are little more than hoaxes perpetrated on ourselves and

posterity. Secondly, it is obvious that to the present these large
scale effects have not really been studied by those who advocate

technological solutions. In a sense this failure is understandable
given the complexities not only of technology itself but also because

of the need to consider economic and social factors. For example, in
matters of economics of life styles, certain effects such as

increased employment increments resulting from the initiation of
pollution control strategies are usually touted as desirable side

effects, when in reality they contribute to undermining the original
objective (see examples later!). However, technocrats generally

behave as if such problems do not exist or have been solved.</P>
<P>	The complexities

inherent in the assessment of energy intensive technology may prevent
the assembly of adequate data or even our knowing precisely what data

are required. Another approach is open to us, however, since the same
physical laws apply here as have been so successfully applied in

laboratory experiments and in industrial processes, and some of these
laws are broad enough in scope to enable us to draw certain

conclusions and to eliminate certain alternatives based on the
general nature of energy transformations, despite the missing

details. Foremost among these systems is the classical
thermodynamics.</P>

<P>	This science found its
first applications in the explanation of precisely those industrial

processes that still are central to our environmental dilemma and
which appeared with the machines of the early industrial revolution.

We recall that Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford) first surmised the
conversion of mechanical energy to heat in the process of boring a

cannon, and at the same time dealt a fatal blow to the caloric
theory<SUP>7 </SUP>. This insight was followed by the precise

experiments of Joule and others, who also began the erection of the
theoretical framework that culminated in the work of Gibbs. While

this approach led to ever more sophisticated applications in
industrial processes and in pure science, it was, strangely, never

extended to technology as a whole, nor has there been any widespread
interest in obvious applications to environmental problems which have

their source in this technology. Attention should however be paid to
the efforts of Odum<SUP>5 </SUP>, Miller<SUP>8</SUP> and, in the

related field of economics, Georgescu-Roegen<SUP>2</SUP>. With the
exception of such rather isolated examples, an impression is gained

that, while thermodynamics applies to individual machines, it does
not apply to the sum of the effects of all machines or the general

energy flux through society. With the recent threat of energy
shortages there has to be sure developed a considerable interest in

various forms of energy &quot;bookkeeping&quot;, in which
agricultural and industrial processes and the means of energy

production have been studied exhaustively for their efficiencies. A
good example is the work of Kakela<SUP>9 </SUP>, which purports to

show support for the technological optimist's view that a resource
can be indefinitely extended through technological progress. However,

these studies seldom are concerned with tracing energy use beyond the
industrial process itself or with entropic effects. While this

approach has led to some useful results and toward more
quantification, it is not true thermodynamics, the application of

which may actually enable us to dispense with much quantification of
this type.</P>

<P>	The approach here also
differs in some important ways from those of Odum, Miller and

Georgescu-Roegen, since these authors seem to have at least a
residual faith in the solutions of high technology. Although this

impression is most apparent in the work of Odum, Miller looks with
hope to a sort of cybernetic age in which information handling plays

the paramount role. Elsewhere, however, he states that&quot;...there
is no technologic solution to pollution.&quot; Generally

Georgescu-Roegen is very forceful in stressing the overriding power
of entropic limits to technology. Yet all these authors in one way or

another hold out hope that humankind will discover the elixir of a
source of clean, abundant technological energy-generally regarded as

solar in origin. Here, however, the reader will find this hope denied
by more than skepticism, beginning with a concise definition of

pollution as energy, as well as the argument for the ultimate
statistical equivalence in terms of deleteriousness of all forms of

technologic energy, whether they are &quot;clean&quot; or :dirty&quot;
in origin. In this way a clean break is made with previous viewpoints

on this subject.</P>

<h2>RELATION

BETWEEN ENERGY AND POLLUTION</h2>
 <ul>
</P>
<P>	The unsavory relation

between technological energy and pollution has of course been widely
recognized, but almost invariably it has been assumed that

technologists are crafty enough to cure the maladies technology
itself has engendered. This attitude is quite apparent in the

quotations cited earlier in which environmental problems brought on
by glutinous consumption are regarded as avoidable or at least

reducible to manageable proportions. Can this be true? Can the fox
really regurgitate live hens?</P>

<P>	To examine this
question it is helpful to begin by generalizing the concept of a

machine, which we may define as any technologic device or process
intended to achieve some desired result through the expenditure of

energy. This generalized machine, depicted in Figure 1, consists of a
box in which a certain quantity of delivered fuel energy E<SUB>f</SUB><SUP>

</SUP> is converted into &quot;work&quot; W, with an intended result
R, and from which a quantity of wasted energy E<SUB>1 </SUB>+ Q<SUB>1

</SUB>is emitted, where E<SUB>1 </SUB>is energy stored in the
environment, perhaps temporarily, and Q<SUB>1 </SUB>is the dissipated

heat.</P>
<P>	The energy symbol E

represents the familiar thermodynamic state function, which usually
consists of internal chemical energy of constitution, but may also

include such forms as gravitational energy. Q and W are never state
functions but depend on the path of application.</P>

<P>	A point of some
significance here is that not only is there an unavoidable waste

energy E<SUB>1 </SUB>+ Q<SUB>1 </SUB>, depending on machine
efficiency, but also the &quot;useful work&quot; W must inevitably be

dissipated in its entirety as pollution E<SUB>2 </SUB>+ Q<SUB>2 </SUB>,
in what might be called the &quot;Rumford Effect.&quot; Thus the

environmental side effects of energy utilization extend far beyond
energy production and industrial use to consumer use and &quot;wear-out&quot;,

in which the energy of constitution, in indeterminate but usually
deleterious modes, interacts in most intimate ways with organisms,

and in particular with humankind. This happens, for example, when
asbestos contaminates such consumer products as baby powder, or when

tissue-reactive hair dyes are used. Although such cases are
recognized as pollution, they are not usually considered as resulting

from the dissipation of technological energy.</P>
<P>	It is a refinement to

point out that sometimes a quantity of energy is stored in R, as when
work is expended in lifting a mass. However, frequently this is not

the case, and R does not represent a higher energy state than the
preexisting one. In fact, R may represent a lower resultant energy

state for a product than a previous one. In the case of no energy
gain, the energy has been expended on the environment, as in much

transportation, in which it is dissipated as friction or as other
forms, and does not reside in the mass.</P>

<P>	The operation of a
machine is most easily perceived in the common cyclic engine in which

E<SUB>f </SUB> is first transformed into heat Q. In this case the
work is derived from Q, and Q<SUB>1 </SUB>is rejected into the

environment as waste. The thermal efficiency of such a machine is</P>
 

</P>
<P> (W/Q) =

(Q-Q<SUB>1 </SUB>)/Q,</P>
 

</P>
<P>which is strictly

limited by the difference in temperature between the heat source and
sink and cannot exceed the efficiency of the ideal Carnot engine. An

important point here is that in addition to the initial dissipation
of the heat Q<SUB>1 </SUB>the dissipation of W as E<SUB>2 </SUB> + Q<SUB>2

</SUB> is indispensable to the operation of the machine, as when
friction between the wheels and ground is required to move a vehicle.</P>

<P>	It is interesting to
consider a quite different example, the expenditure of a chemical

pesticide to kill some target organism. In this case also there is an
initial input of chemical energy E<SUB>f </SUB>, which enters the

habitat of the target. Some of this energy impinges directly on the
organism and is analogous to mechanical work. However, the greatest

part of the energy misses the target and interacts with non-target
organisms or other substances of the environment. In this process

some energy storage occurs and some heat is released through the
chemical reactions which occur. Thus again E<SUB>1 </SUB>+ Q<SUB>1 </SUB>is

dissipated. However, even that part of the pesticide energy which
reaches the target organism continues to interact with the

environment and non-target organisms as partially degraded (in part
metabolized) but still reactive forms of the original chemical. This

is E<SUB>2 </SUB>+ Q<SUB>2 </SUB>.</P>
<P>	At this point it is

helpful to introduce additional thermodynamic state functions, the
entropy S, and the Gibbs Free Energy G. The entropy function is

important because it incorporates the effect of the Second Law of
thermodynamics. G simply represents a convenient artifice because it

includes frequently occurring combinations of more familiar variables
of the system under consideration. Thus we have the fundamental

relation</P>
 

</P>
<P>G<SUB>sy </SUB>=

E<SUB>sy </SUB>- TS<SUB>sy </SUB>+ PV<SUB>sy </SUB>   
  			                                       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)</P>

 
</P>

<P>in which P is the
pressure, V the volume, T the temperature in degrees Kelvin, and E is

the energy as previously defined. The subscript sy indicates the
system under consideration as distinguished from the surroundings.</P>

<P>	The justification for
introducing G<SUB>sy </SUB> is that E<SUB>sy</SUB>,  the energy of

the system, does not necessarily change  (increase or decrease)  in
any indicative manner in a given process, while G<SUB>sy </SUB>

invariably decreases if the process is physically realizable (
spontaneous).  Thus, the change in free energy &Delta;G<SUB>sy </SUB>&lt;

0,  provides an index of great utility in environmental problems, as
it does in conventional technologic and scientific applications. On

the other hand, &Delta;S<SUB>sy</SUB>,  as well as &Delta;E<SUB>sy </SUB>may
be zero, negative or positive in a given spontaneous process,

depending on circumstances. However, &Delta;S<SUB>sy </SUB>is related
to the total or net entropy change &Delta;S<SUB>T </SUB> and the

entropy change of the surroundings &Delta;S<SUB>su  </SUB>as follows:</P>
 

</P>
<P>&Delta;S<SUB>sy</SUB>

+ &Delta;S<SUB>su </SUB>= &Delta;S<SUB>T </SUB>.                         
                                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)</P>

 

<P>Since, by the Second
Law of thermodynamics, &Delta;S<SUB>T </SUB> must always be positive

for any spontaneous process, it, like &Delta;G<SUB>sy </SUB>,  provides
a useful index of such a process. The choice between &Delta;G<SUB>sy </SUB>

and &Delta;S<SUB>T </SUB>is a matter of convenience in practical
calculations, since values of the former are frequently tabulated, or

a matter of taste in theoretical discussions, with the latter
preferred by some authors such as Georgescu-Roegen<SUP>2 </SUP>, for

example.</P>
<P>	As an illustration of

the critical role of energy in environmental degradation we consider
the notorious pollutant carbon monoxide, which may also react with

atmospheric oxygen as follows:</P>
 

</P>
<table cellpadding=6>
<tr><td>Carbon monoxide    </td><td>    oxygen                 </td><td>    &nbsp;     </td><td>         carbon dioxide</td></tr>
<tr><td>    CO         </td><td>       +1/2 O<SUB>2   </td><td>    </SUB>===&gt;     </td><td>     CO<SUB>2     </SUB></td></tr>
</table>

 
</P>

<P>Under the standard
temperature and pressure  (STP)  conditions  (T= 298<SUP>o </SUP>K,

P<SUB>O2 </SUB> = P<SUB>CO </SUB> = P<SUB>CO2</SUB> = 1 atmosphere), 
which serve as a basis of reference, &Delta;G<SUB>sy </SUB>for the

above reaction is -61,650 calories<SUP>10</SUP>. Whether CO reacts in
this innocuous manner in the open air or in a deleterious manner

within an organism, of course depends on where the reactive molecule
finds itself. The point here is that in a thermodynamic sense the

reaction occurs because the reactants  (CO and O<SUB>2 </SUB>in this
case)  have excess <SUB> </SUB>free energy relative to the product (

CO<SUB>2 </SUB>in this case). </P>
<P>	The foregoing example

illustrates the universal characteristic of chemical pollutants by
which they possess free energy in excess of that possessed by their

degradation products and thus defines the fundamental relation
between energy and pollution. Of course, degradation is usually

step-wise, and in this case although CO<SUB>2 </SUB>may be regarded
as less noxious than CO by some, it should be remembered that the

former also has a potential deleteriousness in that it enhances
Earth's greenhouse effect and may, in time, <SUB> </SUB>bring about

disastrous global warming. <SUB>  </SUB>However, further degradation
is possible, as when CO<SUB>2 </SUB>reacts with crustal rocks to form

such stable carbonates as MgCO<SUB>3 </SUB>and CaCO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>11
</SUP>, which for all practical purposes eliminate this constituent

as any form of pollutant. Unfortunately, the latter reactions are too
slow to be of much help.<SUB>       </SUB>

</P>
<P><SUB>	</SUB>Many other

examples could be cited. Thus, the common stack emissions of fossil
fuel-fired power plants contain sulfur dioxide, which reacts with

atmospheric and stack oxygen and water to yield highly corrosive
sulfuric acid, which not only injures living tissue, but attacks

metals and even silicates of building stone<SUB> </SUB><SUP>12</SUP>.
Recently far-flung deterioration of fishing waters and vegetation

from this source has been recognized in acid rain<SUP>13</SUP>.</P>
<P>	Excess free energy is

not confined to chemical reactants, but is a universal property of
all pollutants.<SUB> </SUB>

</P>
<P>It manifests itself in

such diverse cases as silt pollution of bodies of water, in
destructive erosion of soils, and in toxic effects of certain

microscopic particles. For example, &quot;pure&quot; water falling on
soils of natural areas does not behave as a pollutant because it has

not been excessively energized. Yet, through human activity it may
become a pollutant. If vegetated lands are deprived of their cover

and mechanically disturbed, as in timber cutting or overgrazing,
their soils are eroded and transported by more rapidly flowing and

hence energetic water, whose excess energy is then transferred to the
soil particles. Even clear water energized by flowing over

technologically smoothed surfaces such as pavements may be considered
a pollutant since the excess kinetic energy it thus acquires will

later be spent in eroding stream beds and banks. As distinguished
from technological energy which has its source in fuels, this form of

pollutant energy has its source in natural energy flows which have
become misdirected through far smaller &quot;activating&quot;

technological energy inputs<SUP>14</SUP>. Such deleterious hydrologic
effects are at the heart of worldwide problems of desertification,

flooding and famine.</P>
<P>	The most familiar

example of the toxic particle effect is the hazard of the mineral
asbestos. The toxicity of asbestos probably results from excess free

energy which it acquires during processing when the mechanical
separation and fracture of fibers results in numerous poorly

compensated charges on the fiber surfaces and edges. These charges
would tend to react readily and deleteriously with contacting tissues

much as do ions produced by radiation.</P>
<P>	If, as we have

inferred, all forms of pollution are characterized by excess free
energy, does it then follow that all energy ends up as pollution,

corresponding to energy = pollution? The answer to this question is
to be found in the evolutionary history throughout  which organisms

have become adapted to specific types and spectral ranges of energy.
As an illustration, visible light energy is obviously the opposite of

pollution to green plants, while excess ultraviolet or gamma rays
would constitute obvious pollution. Unfortunately, nearly all

technological energy corresponds to pollution due to this
maladaptation quality factor. At this point it is also well to stress

that this factor is at the heart of the degree of deleteriousness
which different forms of energy of identical quantitative measure

possess. Elsewhere<SUP>14</SUP> the writer has indicated the need to
make general allowance for this differential deleteriousness in a

factor analogous to the &quot;quality factor&quot; already in use in
dealing with radioactive substances.</P>

<P>	An entirely different
way in which energy of pollutants manifests itself is through the

process by which these substances become dispersed in the
environment. If, for example, we consider a hypothetical toxic solid

A that becomes an active pollutant by dissolving in water, we may
write the solution reaction as</P>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>    Solid 
       Solution</P>

<P>A   ===&gt;
   A</P>

<P>To simplify the
illustration we assume that A forms an &quot;ideal&quot; mixture with

water<SUP>11</SUP>. The change in Gibbs Free Energy on solution may
then be written as</P>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>&Delta;G =
&Delta;G<SUP>o </SUP> + RTln X<SUB>A</SUB>                            
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   (3)</P>
<P><BR>

</P>
<P>where R is the

universal gas constant, &Delta;G<SUP>o </SUP>is the Gibbs Free Energy
change under standard reference conditions when X<SUB>A</SUB>= 1, and

lnX<SUB>A</SUB> is the natural logarithm of X<SUB>A</SUB>, the mole
fraction concentration of A in the water solution. It is obvious that

as X<SUB>A </SUB>==&gt; 0, corresponding to high dilution or &quot;pure&quot;
water, &Delta;G assumes highly negative values, or &Delta;G &lt;&lt; 0

for any constant value of &Delta;G<SUP>o</SUP>, so that there is
developed an enormous driving potential to bring the toxic substance

into solution. We note that for any constant value of &Delta;G<SUP>o </SUP>
this potential results solely from the entropy of mixing term -RlnX<SUB>A

</SUB>, which is an important contribution to the negative free
energy change.. This type of entropy change is always positive and

provides a measure of the tendency of molecules A to &quot;get lost&quot;
among the water molecules. It is this effect which is behind much

chemical pollution and which makes it so difficult to prevent and
clean up. It is also a wonderful illustration of the physical

constraints on resource inputs in the economic process, as has been
stressed by Georgescu-Roegen<SUP>2 </SUP>. Because of this effect

resources which are originally dilute, or which have been
irreversibly dispersed through use, become prohibitively expensive to

recover, and no industrial process can be designed to circumvent it.
An attempt in this direction was made by Kakela<SUP>9 </SUP>, who

used as an illustration the energy and labor savings which result
from a shift from high grade to pelletized low grade iron ores.

However, in this case the savings are attributable to the fortuitous
textural and magnetic properties of the latter. His analysis also

ignores the component of energy dissipation which in mining these
ores results in serious pollution, especially by amphibolitic

asbestos<SUP>15</SUP>.</P>

 </ul>
<h2>THERMODYNAMICS
OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT</h2>
 <ul>

<P>	We note first of all
that nature does not distinguish between the primary activities of

processing, manufacturing, etc., which supposedly benefit humanity
and which give rise to environmental problems, and those secondary

activities, such as recycling and pollution control, which are
intended to solve these problems. Both are subject to the same

limiting thermodynamic laws. In this sense there is no difference
between a polluting factory and the pollution control device intended

to abate pollution, no difference between the so-called benign or
&quot;soft&quot; technology that is hailed as a panacea by some

environmentalists<SUP>16 </SUP>and its &quot;hard&quot; counterpart.
The same argument applies to the concepts of &quot;clean&quot; and

&quot;dirty&quot; technological energy as usually distinguished.
Furthermore, I will try to show that the concept of technological

efficiency, which is touted as one of the cures for industrial
pollution, loses its meaning if the environment is factored in.</P>

<P>	We have seen that the
manifold pollutants have the one common characteristic of possessing

excess free energy relative to their degradation products. This
energy is either 1) inherent in the raw materials  (such as fuels), 

2) is conferred by processing or manufacturing or 3) results
inadvertently from a variety of human activities.</P>

<P>	The efficiency of a
machine may be illustrated as in Figure 2, which shows how this may

be increased by diverting a greater proportion of input energy to
&quot;useful work.&quot; However, we have already noted how

uncontrolled dissipated energy E<SUB>2</SUB> + Q<SUB>2 </SUB> results
from degradation of this work. This disposes of the idea that

pollution is solely the result of &quot;waste.&quot; We note first of
all that there is no intrinsic reason why E<SUB>2 </SUB>, Q<SUB>2 </SUB>

etc. should be less deleterious in nature than E<SUB>1</SUB>, Q<SUB>1</SUB>
etc. Also, if we imagine that an increase in efficiency results in a

new distribution E'<SUB>2</SUB>, Q'<SUB>2 </SUB>etc., we have no
reason to hope that in general deleteriousness will decrease per unit

of energy dissipated. Finally, we note that on average different
energy sources will, in the same culture, result in the same general

distribution of pollutant energy forms, and hence degree of
deleteriousness. Thus hydro or solar electric energy will be used to

produce identical toxic chemicals as does that of nuclear
electricity. The great variety of energy conversions in modern

technology assures a certain statistical equivalence of
deleteriousness in each unit of energy utilized, regardless of

source, and the average degree of deleteriousness is a function of
the total culture at a given moment. Consequently, the environment on

average sees only E<SUB>f </SUB> or Q, the total energy input. In
this context the only benefit to the environment of increasing the

efficiency W/Q is that such an increase will require a smaller Q or
E<SUB>f </SUB> to accomplish a given task. In other words, the

environmental impact of a machine depends primarily not on W/Q, but
on Q. From this result it may be concluded that no matter how

efficient industry becomes, continuous expansion can only bring
increasing pollution and environmental deterioration.</P>

<P>	The indeterminateness
of the E's and Q's with respect to deleteriousness results from the

same Second Law constraints that impose quantitative limits on W/Q
and is an expression of the characteristic that all energy

transformations are utterly spontaneous. Consequently there can be no<I>
overall </I>control of energy release or utilization. Energetically

all that is accomplished in the industrial process is the
&quot;arrangement&quot; of energy events such as useful chemical

reactions in a manner analogous to the arrangement of a party or
celebration. However, the energy party always proceeds according to

its own rules  (which an invention discovers)  and usually feeds on
larger and more remote energy systems whose very existence is

sometimes unsuspected. For example, we should question who monitors
all the pollution that results from a pollution control program!</P>

<P>	Although the Second
Law effects form the basis of machine inefficiencies and

environmental impacts, they are also vital to its very operation.
Thus the increase in entropy and the energy loss associated with

friction are not only necessary to such processes as locomotion, but
act to dissipate the energy after it is utilized. For example,

friction between wheels and ground is required to move a vehicle, but
the resultant heat must be dissipated to prevent undue rise in

temperature. Similarly, in the case of a chemical pesticide, the
increase in entropy associated with the spontaneous dissemination and

dissolution of the pesticide, as described by equation (3), is a
requirement for reaching the target organism, although it is also an

index of inefficient use and results in undesirable impacts.</P>
<P>	Now consider the

effect of the application of a pollution control device on an
industry from the standpoint of the First Law requirements on energy

flows. First consider the situation without pollution controls, in
which a quantity of energy E<SUB>1 </SUB>is applied to raw materials

M<SUB>1 </SUB>, yielding a useful product M<SUB>2 </SUB>and pollution
P<SUB>1</SUB>. The Ps and Ms incorporate the same internal energies

of constitution as the Es and are expressed in the same units.
However, implicit in them are other energy forms as well. Thus the Ps

may be regarded as equivalent to E<SUB>1 </SUB>+ Q<SUB>1</SUB>, while
the useful product dissipates to E<SUB>2 </SUB>+ Q<SUB>2 </SUB>as

discussed earlier. The pollutants individually and collectively are
subject to the constraints of equation (1), as expressions of the

Second Law, which also limits control over the degree of
deleteriousness.</P>

<P>	If pollution control
energy E<SUB>c </SUB>is applied to pollution P<SUB>1</SUB>,  the

latter is thereby reduced to P'<SUB>1</SUB>. Note,  however, that by
the First Law, the &quot;controlled&quot; component P<SUB>1 </SUB>-

P'<SUB>1</SUB> has not disappeared, but has merely been transformed
and/or transported elsewhere. Furthermore, the added increment E<SUB>c

</SUB>= P'<SUB>1 </SUB>+ P<SUB>2 </SUB>- P<SUB>1</SUB>, where the
total dissipated energy of pollution control, represented by P<SUB>2</SUB>,

must now be disposed of. For example, the sludges generated by
certain pollution control devices may be transported to disposal

areas where they bring blight to the landscape and poison water
supplies<SUP>17</SUP>, or SO<SUB>2 </SUB>vented in tall smokestacks

may appear hundreds of miles downwind as acid rain. Proposals for the
reclamation of useful chemicals from such sludges and emissions would

of course increase the increment E<SUB>c</SUB>. The important point,
however, is that P<SUB>2 </SUB>+ P'<SUB>1 </SUB>&gt; P<SUB>1</SUB>,

which is the inevitable result from the laws of thermodynamics. Also,
as we have seen, the statistics of the diverse Ps results in a rough

equivalence in their degrees of deleteriousness. Generally, however,
one pollution form is favored over another for cultural or other

reasons, resulting in tradeoffs which may not always be wise. For
example, the immediate benefit of achieving clean sewage plant

effluent is usually deemed more important than assurance of the safe
disposal of resultant sludges, which may eventually poison ground

water. A more suitable effort would entail the low energy solution of
prohibiting toxic materials such as heavy metals, pesticides and

household chemicals from entering the sewage system in the first
place.</P>

<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
  <ul>
<P>	The monstrous

character of nuclear energy is brought home to us by a quotation from
Weinberg<SUP>18 </SUP>to the effect that nuclear technologists have

made a Faustian bargain of sorts with society, the chief problem
being the long term &quot;control&quot; necessary in safeguarding

nuclear wastes. However, the analogy does not go far enough in that
the &quot;bargain&quot; is seen here as an illusion of control which

pervades <I>all </I>of energy intensive technology. 
</P>

<P>	Although it is
difficult to do a sufficiently thorough bookkeeping job to uncover

all the energy input and dissipation modes of even a simple
technology, some highly suggestive indicators exist. From the

literature of &quot;pollution control&quot;, for example, there
emerges a sequence of cases of varying degrees of obviousness of the

breakdown or failure of control. Rather than discuss the most obvious
cases, which, for example, include that of a technology not achieving

previously set standards, we pass immediately to that of greatest
interest, in which completely effective pollution control is

apparently achieved, but, as has been true so far, external
interactions of the control technology have not been taken into

account. The indirect form of pollution envisioned stems here not
only from the complexities of the technology itself, but to a great

degree from its societal underpinnings, from the many connections and
lifestyle ramifications still mostly unappreciated. The statistical

equivalence of pollution and technological energy argued for earlier
provides a convenient bridge to studies such as those of Hannon<SUP>19

</SUP> and Herendeen<SUP>20 </SUP>, which relate the degree of energy
intensiveness to economic factors and life styles. According to these

studies there is an almost linear relation between total consumer (
family)  energy use and income, so that regardless social stratum,

total energy use rises directly with income. We need only substitute
&quot;pollution&quot; for &quot;energy&quot; in this relation. Not

surprisingly it was found by them that the most labor intensive
activity ranked lowest on the economic scale.</P>

<P>	The bearing of all
this on the effects of pollution control technology is as follows: It

is apparent first of all that any technology, no matter how
sophisticated, has numerous links to basic extractive industries,

support industries, etc. that are usually highly pollution prone in
their own rights. Thus a pollution control technology may itself

ultimately depend on rather primitive mining industries as well as
fossil or nuclear fuels that emit a host of toxic pollutants, albeit

in remote locations. More interesting, however, is the supporting
societal infrastructure. For example, it is a common boast of the

environmental optimist that one of the benefits of pollution control
programs is that they &quot;create jobs.&quot; According to an

article by Green<SUP>21 </SUP>, the US Environmental Protection
Agency estimates that the number of jobs directly resulting from

pollution control expenditures is as high as 600,000. Similar figures
are quoted for West Germany. Now we know that many of these jobs are

of a highly skilled nature and pay well, so that they fall high on
the Hannon and Herendeen curve.  Thus pollution control must give

rise to the same two classes-production and consumption- of pollution
sources, and of the same order of intensity, as does ordinary

consumer activity in an affluent society. The pollutants thus
generated are of course an integral part of P<SUB>2</SUB>.</P>

<P>	It must also be
concluded that if the evolution of society as a whole is considered,

there appears to have been no real progress in the efficiency of
energy use or in stemming waste and pollution from this source. There

can of course be no doubt that, taken by themselves, the efficiencies
of modern factories with respect to energy and material use greatly

exceed their earlier counterparts<SUP>22 </SUP>. Yet the progressive
use by industry of more dilute  (lower grade)  material resources

imposes an inefficiency of its own on total resource use that
counters increases in the machine efficiency which makes this use

possible. For example, the mining of low grade ores made possible by
new machines and techniques creates more waste and pollution per ton

of metal recovered than ever before<SUP>2 </SUP>. Consequently, the
total effect of mining activities and those industries which depend

on them is constantly decreasing efficiency. Also, the advent of ever
more technologically elaborate and sometimes more energy efficient

machines in the consumer society has given rise to corresponding
increases in trivialization, which, in a pragmatic sense, is

inefficiency. The smoky but practical passenger trains of the 1930s
were replaced by automobiles traveling over highly impractical routes

 (suburban commuting etc.)  or for entirely trivial reasons.
Similarly, the recycled milk bottles and other containers of this

early period yielded to the &quot;throw away&quot; system of today.</P>
<P>	On the other side of

the coin we have seen that ever increasing entropy associated with
the ever expanding technological energy flux is synonymous with

disorder and loss of control. Is it possible then that there is a
simpler relation between energy use and social problems than anyone

suspected? Is there, despite the elaboration of technology, an
inevitable decrease in social order which results from this massive

societal energy flux that can no longer simply be rejected into the 
&quot;surroundings.&quot; Certainly the disordering effects of

superimposing high energy economies and social mores on traditional
societies such as those of the Middle East are apparent. Even the

fact that corresponding social disorder does not appear in even
higher energy established industrial societies, does not contradict

this thesis, since the latter may have achieved an at least
metastable adaptation of sorts during the comparatively slow

evolution to the high energy flux of their own industrializations. 
</P>

<P>	We may now summarize
our answer to the questions raised in the introduction. First, is it

possible to control pollution? If we mean by this many of the
commonly accepted controls through technology, the answer must be an

emphatic no. According to thermodynamic reasoning, we can order or
&quot;arrange&quot; a part of the local environment only at the

expense of disordering the whole. Thus, local pollution control,
which depends on energy inputs, can only result in greater pollution

of the total  (global)  system. This result does not of course
preclude pollution control through such means as technological

innovations or administrative actions which decrease energy inputs.
Thus we can effectively ban a pollutant such as a pesticide, shut

down an industry, or substitute a more efficient technology. Of
course such actions may have their price in loss of convenience or

jobs or in increases in the price of goods.</P>
<P>	Secondly, is there

really an entity like &quot;clean energy'? According to the foregoing
analysis we must conclude that clean technological energy is a

contradiction in terms. Once an energetic process is initiated, the
process itself determines the energy path of dissipation and the

resultant pollutants, unless additional energy, with its own burden
of pollutants, is brought to bear through control technology. In this

way energy produced by so-called &quot;clean energy sources&quot; is
immediately converted to the societal mix of dirty energy forms. The

same reasoning applies to the concepts of &quot;hard&quot; vs. &quot;soft&quot;
technologies.</P>

<P>	We see then, that as
far as the foregoing analysis is concerned, there is nothing whatever

to encourage the technologic optimist who favors the type of economic
growth that depends on ever increasing energy inputs. Indeed, as

Georgescu-Roegen<SUP>2 </SUP> has pointed out, there is little more
solace in the steady state economy, since this at very least requires

a steady input of energy, which may be very large for large
populations. There is also very little to buoy up the spirits of

environmental optimists, who tend not only to favor a steady state,
but also retain a naive faith in the possibility of pollution

&quot;control&quot; by means of technological devices. Such are the
enigmas and dilemmas we now confront. To them sophisticated analysis

may indeed bring insights, but only self-denial and austerity can
bring solutions.
