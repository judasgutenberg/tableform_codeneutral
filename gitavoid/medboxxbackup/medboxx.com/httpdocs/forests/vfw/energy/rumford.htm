   As one dedicated to the protection of wild nature, I couldn't
agree more. But as a student of that nature, the diabolical pistons,

drive shaft and wheels of Dave's colorful image have long fascinated
me. I've even tried to run them in reverse, looking for logical

arguments to support my instinctive passion for the wild. In fact,
looking back, we find the best of the arguments in support of the

wild already present in the brainchild of the early industrial
revolution, namely the then-budding  science of thermodynamics.</P>

<P>	
    Thermodynamics is concerned with energy metabolism, with the

processes of transformation of one energy form into another, which
makes the industrial monster run and at the same time fixes the

nature of its bite. Our lead into the matter of energy
transformations is the work of Benjamin Thompson  (Count Rumford),  a

loyalist physicist of revolutionary days who noticed that when cannon
were bored frictional heat was produced equivalent in amount to the

input of mechanical energy from the boring machine. This result,
which boggled 18th century minds, illustrates the equivalence of

different energy forms and may be called the &quot;Rumford effect&quot;
 (Mueller, &quot;<a href=energy_enviro.htm>Energy in the Environment and the Second Law of

Thermodynamics</a>&quot;, NASA Doc. X-644-72-130, 1972.).  For me it has
been a helpful concept in understanding the environmental impact of

technology.</P>
<P> 

    Those concerned about the environmental effects of energy use
have long touted the role of increased efficiency in overcoming

failings of the industrial machine, and in many quarters the
impression was left that if efficiency could be increased enough,

pollution would vanish  (Mueller, Lughnasadh).  This assumption also
underlies the confidence in so-called &quot;clean energy&quot;

sources such as solar, hydro, and wind, and explains the disregard of
the use to which this energy is put once it enters distribution

lines. Let's examine the notion of clean energy.</P>

<P> 

   The diagram shows how energy fed into a machine or technological
process is split into &quot;useful&quot; and waste energy. In

anthropocentric terms, the efficiency is the ratio of useful to total
energy input. Unfortunately, this definition has little validity in

the natural world where different values hold sway.</P>
<P> 

   The negative environmental impact of waste energy is obvious, as
in the case of thermal pollution from power plants. But an important

point usually overlooked is that once a particular technology is
chosen, the forms of waste energy and pollution are utterly fixed.

Thus, frictional heat  (thermal pollution)  was one of the
inescapable consequences of boring cannon  (another was undoubtedly

metal borings which form toxic wastes on contact with water).  The
forms of waste energy and pollution can of course be altered by

tinkering, as with &quot;pollution control devices.&quot; But then
one must cope with waste and pollution from these secondary sources.

 (Witness the climatic effects of tall chimneys or the sludge
disposal problems of &quot;scrubbers.&quot;) </P>

<P>
      A further point is that the waste frictional heat from an

industrial process  such as cannon boring is in a sense different
from waste energy from a power plant, inasmuch as it has passed

through a &quot;useful&quot; stage, whereas that from the power plant
has not. With cannon boring, the frictional energy itself played an

indispensable role in the &quot;use.&quot; This is a general aspect
of the Rumford effect-even presumed useful objects such as bedsprings

and teacups finally give up their energy as various forms of
pollution when they wear out and are scrapped. Thus all technologic

energy, whether it is waste from the start or whether it passes
through a useful form, ends up as pollution. This is in marked

contrast to natural energy forms to which organisms have adapted
through the millennia. 

</P>
<P>

      As a result of our lack of
control over pollution emanating from any technology-except by

introducing another technology- the economic marketplace works, at
least in the long term, to ensure a variety of pollution forms of

unpredictable toxicity and degradation  (Mueller, <I>Science, 192</I>,
1976).  

</P>
<P>

      Pollution from degraded as well as waste energy may be regarded
as energy out of control. Alternatively we can speak of increased

entropy or disorder as defined by the second law of thermodynamics.
When technologic processes and machines convert energy inputs such as

fuels and wind energy into useful forms -mechanical, chemical,
electrical, etc.- by steps, there is a loss or waste component at

each step. If one of these steps results in a manufactured product,
some energy resides in the product and will be dissipated as

pollution in the environment as the product wears out and is
scrapped. Since all technologic energy ends up as pollution one way

or another through the generalized Rumford effect, and since the
quality of pollution is usually unpredictable, all energy eventually

passes from control, and the impact of energy use depends not on
efficiency but on total energy use.</P>

<P>
	     But isn't it true that if we use energy more efficiently we'll

need less of it to accomplish the same task and thus total energy use
will be reduced? Yes, but the history of energy use has been one of

continuous expansion so that any small increase in efficiency is
readily overcome. Even if the increase in efficiency kept pace with

technological expansion, the rate of pollution production would
remain essentially the same and the pollution load would continue to

increase. Furthermore, the increase in entropy that accompanies the
expenditure of energy implies a disordering effect of enormous

consequence to the regulation of industry and society.</P>
<P>

       The generalized Rumford effect presents us with a devastating
world picture of technology, of a truly driverless machine. In this

picture we see every technological process and artifact either
bearing a legacy of realized pollution  or containing potential

pollution. The realized pollution is that energy expended in service
or manufacturing as both waste and useful energy. The potential

pollution is represented by the energy bound in manufactured or
otherwise technologically-altered materials. All these energy forms

result in pollution over which we have no overall control except to
diminish or cease their use.</P>

<P>
       The illusory nature of the use and dissipation of energy is

well illustrated by our waste disposal systems. Among public
officials,  sanitary landfills have been regarded as greatly

preferable to open dumps. Although such landfills, in which trash is
covered by earth, may contain only small amounts of highly toxic

materials, they inevitably contain huge masses of energy-rich
materials such as plastic and paper. What was not anticipated and is

still not fully grasped is that the energy available from the latter
can, through chemical reaction and anaerobic decay,  act to

concentrate and mobilize the former. Thus gases such as methane and
heated aqueous fluids can transport heavy metals, PCBs, dioxin and

other poisons into soil, air and water. All over the world, and
particularly in &quot;advanced societies&quot;, there are waste dumps

, all toxic in varying degree, undergoing a ripening process in which
their latent energy components represent time bombs that are even now

beginning to explode. Thermodynamics precludes successful &quot;cleanups&quot;
of these dumps because they represent enormous entropy pumps which

have been working for years.</P>




<P>

        To those who despair that
all this is completely pessimistic, I can only answer that it depends

on one's point of view. For decades, establishment scientists aided
and abetted our rampant technology by <I>selectively</I> applying

certain scientific principles suited to coercing nature. This led to
&quot;progress&quot; but also to a multiplicity of interlocking

environmental and social crises. They ignored the &quot;bad news&quot;
of other scientific principles such as are embodied in ecology and

thermodynamics. To those of us who believe that our only salvation is
a return to nature's dominion, the consequent loss of material

conveniences is a small price to pay. To us, the pessimistic signals
from science are messages of hope. Those who still cling to the

narrow and outmoded  world view of the technological optimist are
about to learn the hard truth of that brick wall.</P>
