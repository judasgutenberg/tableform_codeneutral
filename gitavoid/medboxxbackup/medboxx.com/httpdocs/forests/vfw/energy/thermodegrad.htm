<h1>THERMODYNAMICS  OF 
ENVIRONMENTAL  DEGRADATION</h1>
 

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<ul>
<P>
<P>Environmental degradation today has assumed the
magnitude of planetary processes such as geologic erosion or the
atmospheric circulation. Understanding of the many facets of this
degradation in scientific terms will probably exhaust most known
disciplines. 

<P>

<P>It is the thesis of this paper that the laws of
thermodynamics, which are concerned with energy transformations,
place severe constraints on the affairs of man and his relationship
to his environment. Indeed, thermodynamic principles seem
particularly well suited to treating the interaction of technology
and natural systems and the major product of this interaction,
pollution.<a href=#star>*</a> In this light the recently enunciated laws of ecology 
(Commoner, 1969)  are seen as the biological and sociological
expressions of the thermodynamic laws. We shall see that both ecology
and thermodynamics are also closely paralleled by new viewpoints of
economics  (Olson and Cumberland, 1970),  which are emerging as a
result of environmental concerns.
<P>

<P>This paper is concerned with the general
features of environmental thermodynamics and attempts to set forth
the postulates which are regarded as necessary for a more detailed
and quantitative development.
<P>
</ul>
<h2>POLLUTION  DEFINED</h2>
<ul>
<P>

<P>In a sense all pollution may be regarded as
symptomatic of the general degradation of Earth's natural<a href=#car>^</a> realms-
air, water and land. As these are converted to man's technological
use the environment is degraded in numerous ways. It should be made
clear at the outset however that natural processes such as forest
fires also pollute. There is little difference in kind between these
and technological sources of pollution. What is different about
technology is the magnitude of its impact and the characteristic that
the organic world contains limited genetic resilience to respond to
technological innovations of this magnitude.

<p>
<P>The comparison and summation of the total effects
of pollution are hampered by the diversity and virtual lack of common
characteristics of the many pollutants. It is difficult, for example,
to compare the effects of sewage pollution and sediment pollution, or
of either of these with the effects of pesticides. However, there is
one characteristic which all pollutants appear to have in common and
which serves to define them in thermodynamic terms: their high energy
content relative to the raw materials from which they were derived
and relative to the degradation products which they ultimately yield.
Their high energy content relative to the latter is particularly
apparent since this energy must be dissipated in the spontaneous
process of degradation. It may turn out that the energy content of
pollutants is a reliable index of their environmental impact.
<P>

<P>Through man's not always purposeful intervention
natural materials acquire energy in excess of what they would possess
had this intervention not occurred. In this way practically any
material may become a pollutant. We may illustrate by considering an
example from hydrology. &quot;Pure&quot; water and soil or subsoil in
natural areas do not behave as pollutants. Yet through man's activity
both may become pollutants. If naturally forested land is deprived of
its vegetation and mechanically disturbed, not only is the topsoil
lost, but also the subsoil is eroded and transported down stream. On
such land the energy of falling water is not dissipated through
absorption by the leaf mat and topsoil. Rather the water moves
downhill in sheet wash or in temporary streams. During flow this
water also acquires the potential energy of the disturbed soil
particles. The resulting turbid waters deposit sediments that clog
stream channels and otherwise diminish environmental quality.
Consequently, silt is widely recognized as a major pollutant  (The
Cost of Clean Water, 1969).  However, even energized pure water with
no sediment load may be considered a pollutant since its excess
energy will later lead to erosion of stream beds and banks.
<P>

<P>In another example, a wide variety of chemical
pollutants are characterized by the possession of free energies of
formation in excess of those of the raw materials from which they
were derived. This energy was of course purposefully conferred
through the manufacturing process and is again released as the
material goes to a lower free energy state in spontaneous
degradation. A good example is provided by the native metals which
release heat  (decrease in enthalpy)  as they combine with oxygen 
(Kubaschewski and Evans, 1958).  A quantitative illustration of the
effect is also afforded by the SO<SUB>2</SUB> production of fossil
fuel power plants. The subsequent step-wise degradation of this
component gives rise to numerous detrimental effects in the
environment. A 350 megawatt plant vents approximately 75 tons of SO<SUB>2</SUB>
per day  (Urone and Schroeder, 1969).  In sunlight SO<SUB>2</SUB>
 yields a variety of photochemically induced products.
However, much of it is ultimately converted to H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>
 (sulfuric acid)  according to the overall reaction

<P>However H<SUB>2</SUB>
SO<SUB>4</SUB>
attacks a variety of other substances, including
silicates  (Raymahashay, 1968),  and so results in considerable
economic loss. Some of these degradation processes may appear as
toxic effects in organisms. In the case of pesticides these energy
dissipative processes are purposeful, but in many other environmental
contaminants they are not.
<P>

<P>However, we must not confuse the
thermodynamic stability of a chemical compound with any resistance it
may show to degradation. DDT is persistent in time, not because it is
thermodynamically stable, but because it is kinetically stable. It
simply takes a long time to react with its surroundings.
<P>
</ul>
<h2>THERMODYNAMICS  OF  POLLUTION </h2>
<ul>

<P>

<P>When a heat engine
yields &quot;useful work&quot; through the consumption of a given
quantity of fuel energy, a certain quantity of heat is always
rejected to the external environment. Thus if Q<SUB>1</SUB>
is the heat originally supplied, W the work
produced and Q<SUB>2</SUB> the heat rejected, we have
<P>

<P> 					Q<SUB>1</SUB>
 =  Q<SUB>2</SUB>
 +  W
<P>

<P>The efficiency of the engine is
<P>

<P>						W/Q<SUB>1</SUB>
<P>

<P>It is important to
realize that Q<SUB>2</SUB> is a necessary consequence  of the second
law of thermodynamics, which states that heat cannot be completely
converted into work.
<P>
<hr noshade size=1>
 <div align=right><a name=4>Page 4</a></div>
<p>

<P> The sum of the effects of our
technology is that of a heat engine which still depends largely on
fossil fuels but which may be in the process of conversion to nuclear
fuel, should this prove socially acceptable.
<P>

<P>It is interesting that
although we speak of a quantity of useful work W, and the
corresponding thermal efficiency, neither of these concepts has any
direct meaning as far as the environment is concerned. First of all
it is clear that W depends on the way it is measured and on what we
regard as useful work. The environment, on the other hand, sees only
Q<SUB>1</SUB> ,
all of which must be dissipated or stored. Thus in boring a hole in a
steel block, we expend Q<SUB>1</SUB>, obtain W and reject Q<SUB>2</SUB>.
However W is transformed to other energy forms
such as the heat of friction, which must be dissipated. This heat may
appear as thermal pollution in addition to that produced by Q<SUB>2</SUB>.
We may then ask what effect on the environment
does efficiency have? The answer is that the effect of an increased
W/Q<SUB>1</SUB> is to require a smaller Q<SUB>1</SUB> to accomplish
any given task that we regard as &quot;useful.&quot; The smaller the
Q<SUB>1</SUB>, the
smaller the quantity of pollution and environmental impact for any
given process. Thus the environmental impact of engine efficiency
depends not on W/Q<SUB>1</SUB>, but on Q<SUB>1</SUB>. An obvious
conclusion, which is not exactly new, is that the environment would
benefit from the absence of technology.
<P>

<P>In thermodynamics it is always
necessary to define the system to which reference is made. In our
examples we shall be concerned with systems of varying size, and all
these systems shall be &quot;open&quot; in that some sort of
communication will exist with the surroundings. The smallest type of
system we shall consider is a restricted region of Earth's surface of
the order of a kilometer or less in dimension and with a vertical
dimension of the order of several kilometers, including the subsoil
and overlying atmosphere. We shall consider particularly the energy
flux through such  regions before and after they are modified by
technology. The largest system of interest is the entire surface
region of the planet, including the atmosphere and oceans. This
region, encompassing the entire biosphere, is the region of ultimate
pollution dissipation and the region penultimate energy dissipation.
The biosphere is practically closed with respect to pollutants
themselves, but as these become increasingly degraded,  their energy
is radiated into space.
<P>

<P>It is apparent that the technological
engine is very inefficient as estimated from its components, no
matter which way this efficiency is measured. Even the most advanced 
electric power generating plants have thermal efficiencies of less
than 40 percent and most power plant efficiencies are nearer 30
percent  (Barr,1970).  Our dominant  transportation systems are far
less efficient than this. For example, it has been estimated that the
private automobile  has an efficiency of less than 10 percent,
although only about one passenger is transported  (Freeman, 1970). 
However, we have seen that pollutants, whether they be of a physical
or chemical nature, are bearers of excess energy.
<P>
<hr noshade size=1>
 <div align=right><a name=5>Page 5</a></div>
<p>

<P> If this energy is dissipated by
direct transfer of heat, we refer to it as thermal pollution. If it
is dissipated by exothermic chemical reaction of unstable synthetic
compounds, we call it chemical pollution, and if by energetic
particles and fluids we call it physical pollution. 

<P>

<P>In addition to the heat dissipated in
pollution there are also the effects of changes of entropy. Entropy
is an index of the degree of disorder present in matter. The entropy
always increases with an increase in the disorder or randomness of
atomistic particles. Such an increase in disorder is inherent in
spontaneous processes such as heat flow and chemical dissolution.
Thus the net effect of heat dissipation from a heat engine is an
increase of entropy for the total system of engine and the
surrounding environment. The same is true when atoms, ions or other
particles dissolve into the environment. For example, the dispersion
of mercury or other toxic metals into natural waters, bottom
sediments and organisms is difficult to prevent or counteract because
of the large increase in entropy of mixing involved in the
dispersion.
<P>

<P>Pollutants emanate from natural
environments which have been modified by technology and they carry
off the excess energy of these environments. Modified  environments
therefore exist at higher levels of energy absorption and dissipation
than the natural environments which prevail under the given
geological and climatic conditions. If we confine ourselves to the
case in which no local energy sinks or sources are involved, and in
which a steady state prevails, the general picture may be outlined as
in Figure 1. In this simplified and idealized scheme a given quantity
of energy flows into the system and the same quantity flows out
during the average yearly cycle. Figure 1-a shows the natural &quot;ground
state&quot; in which there is a certain internal conversion of energy
forms within a restricted environmental region of the Earth's surface
which depends on details of the geology, climate and the specific
ecology. For example, solar radiant energy is utilized both in
photosynthesis and in heating the water in the run-off. The region of
interest is regarded as extending upward to a &quot;compensation
level&quot;, which is defined as that level of the atmosphere above
which a given environmental modification has a negligible effect on
the total weather energy input and output. For example, replacing a
forest by a grassy field would decrease the interaction between air
and the surface through diminished roughness. However, this effect
probably would extend only a few thousand feet above the site. On the
other hand, dense smoke emissions from an industrial site could cut
off considerable light to higher elevations. Strictly, such
compensation surfaces should be included for subsoil and lateral
exchange; however, these are probably minor effects in most cases.
<P>

<P>Figure 1-b shows the technological
energy input and the equivalent energy dissipated outward in a
modified region. This figure refers to the simple case of an
&quot;isolated modified region.&quot;

<p>


<P> Isolated regions are distinguished
from non-isolated regions by the characteristic that the former emit
pollutants but absorb virtually none from other regions. An example
of an isolated region is a cleared field maintained as a meadow in a
large forest tract. It is obvious that a region in a city does not
qualify as an isolated region since it receives pollutants from
nearby regions.
<P>

<P>Figure 1-b should be regarded as
being superimposed on Figure 1-a. Then if the compensation level 
(surface)  choice is adequate, the total original energy component
exchanged with the external environment is the same as before
modification, except that the energy spectrum will in general be
altered, and the additional technological energy received must be
dissipated into the surroundings. 

<P>

<P>The modified regions of high energy
dissipation are analogous  to atomic and macroscopic chemical systems
in that these regions spontaneously revert to the ground or low
energy state of the indigenous ecosystem if the technological energy
is withheld. We may illustrate by considering a typical land area of
the northeastern United States. Under natural conditions such an area
will be covered by a climax forest  consisting largely of hardwoods.
If this forest is cleared and planted to grass, a continual input of
energy is required to maintain it as a meadow. The power absorbed by
the meadow and dissipated in various ways is a definite quantity in
excess of that dissipated by the climax forest, the atmosphere above
and the underlying soil under natural conditions. The excess energy
will be dissipated by such pollutants as silt, smoke, sound,
pesticides, fertilizers, etc., which wash into the streams or which
escape into the air.
<P>

<P>It should be pointed out that at
least three secular changes result in deviations from the steady
state situation. These are

</OL>
<P>

<P>It might also occur to some readers
that mass should serve as an alternative to energy as a
characteristic of pollutants, since mass units are frequently
employed in pollution monitoring. However, brief consideration will
show that there is no simple relation between mass and energy content
above the size range of subatomic systems. A good example is
radioactive pollutants, in which only a very small mass may be
involved. It therefore appears that mass is a parameter of less
general applicability than energy in comparing one pollutant with
another.
<P>
<hr noshade size=1>
 <div align=right><a name=8>Page 8</a></div>
<p>

<P>At this point it might
also be asked why high energy content of pollutants should so
frequently have deleterious effects on the organic world. It must
first be understood that there is nothing wrong with energy <I>per
se</I>, since all biological systems utilize energy in some form or
other. However, we are here concerned with energy that is
spontaneously dissipated into the surroundings and therefore
corresponds to a large increase in the entropy or disorder of the
environment. This type of energy leads to particles being in random
locations at unforeseen times and on random breakage or formation of
chemical bonds. Organisms, on the other hand, require energy of
certain definite types in certain spectral ranges. Furthermore, they
have adapted to absorb this energy from familiar sources such as
sunlight. There is little in their genetic heritage that enables them
to cope with the great variety of pollutant energy sources.
<P>
</ul>
<H2>ENERGY   CONCENTRATION  IN MODIFIED  REGIONS</H2>
<ul>
<P>
<P>Although the excess energy flux
through modified regions in a steady state balances the technological
energy input, there may also be conspicuous concentrations of energy
from existing natural sources, and this energy may greatly enhance
the flow of pollutants. This occurs, for example, when natural water
run-off is accelerated by removal of vegetation. The energy of
falling water is then concentrated in time and in particular
localities, with resulting sheet wash and gully erosion. As is the
case with excess technological energy, the energy concentrated in
this way is frequently out of harmony with the existing ecology and
with man's own goals. Indeed, the large drainage modification
projects for hydropower and flood control, are also of this kind. It
is well known that the long term disadvantage of such energy
concentrating projects in many cases outweigh their short term
benefits.
<P>
</ul>
<H2>RECYCLING,  POLLUTION  CONTROL  AND  LIFE  STYLE</H2>
<ul>
<P>
<P>The concept of the recycling of goods
and the utilization of &quot;pollution control devices&quot; have
found great favor among the general public and even among
environmentalists. The attraction of these methods of pollution
abatement stems largely from their apparent promise of being
effective while allowing a continued high goods consumption rate or
even permitting this rate to increase. However, these concepts, which
may be characterized as &quot;high energy concepts of pollution
control&quot;, contain some serious contradictions from a
thermodynamic standpoint. One such contradiction involves recycling.
Perhaps the most prevalent view is that efficiency in recycling
consists in recovering the largest possible proportion of goods used.
However, recycling is an attempt to save resources and to avoid the
disposal of pollutants, and as such is an ordering process akin to
manufacturing itself.
<P>
<hr noshade size=1>
 <div align=right><a name=9>Page 9</a></div>
<p>

<P> Such processes also involve
spontaneous thermodynamic processes of wear and energy dissipation
and thus require an input of energy. Thus, although recycling may
indeed reduce the total consumption of energy and other resources,
this result is by no means assured. In any case, recycling involves
the substitution of one form of pollution for the original form. For
example, the recovery of glass bottles may substitute detergent and
combustion pollution for glass pollution. All these factors must be
given proper weight in determining the efficiency of a recycling
process. An instance of the law of diminishing returns is the
hypothetical 100 percent recovery of some recycled item. It is clear
that such an attempt would involve the prevention of wear and so
would require an infinite input of energy and would create an
infinite amount of pollution. It is not difficult to think of
practical instances in which this principle is operative-for example,
in the recovery of bricks during building demolition.
<P>

<P>Equally important
illustrations are provided by pollution control devices such as are
installed on automobiles or industrial plants. As in the case of
recycling, such devices are intended to allow a given technological
activity to continue undiminished. However, analysis of the type
presented in the previous sections suggests that the hoped-for
&quot;clean&quot; cars and industries may be virtually
indistinguishable from their &quot;dirty&quot; predecessors in
overall effect. In the case of the automobile the proposed pollution
control devices are largely directed at the elimination of high
energy gaseous emissions such as CO, hydrocarbons and nitrogen
oxides. However, there is a very large and as yet undetermined amount
of pollution which results from the manufacture, wear, servicing, and
cleaning of automobiles. The considerable quantity of oil which drips
from cars  in parking lots and on highways finds its way into streams
and storm drains and is a major stream pollutant. Also, the direct
and indirect stream, land and air pollution which results from
highways and from highway material manufacture is in the early stage
of documentation  (Mueller and Lahn, 1970).  The proposed emission
control programs are well known to be associated with an expanding
automotive technology which will lead to an increase of most of the
pollutants not covered by control devices. Part of the expanded
technology will also be associated with the control devices and their
monitoring systems. If this overall expansion to technology is not
accompanied by a compensating increase in efficiency, there will be a
net <I>increase</I> in pollution as a result of the installation of
the control devices.
<P>

<P>In the past the efficiency of a
technological process, whatever the criteria of efficiency, has
almost invariably been confined to the process itself. By this method
it has been possible to build &quot;sophisticated technologies&quot;
by utilization of a far greater base of unsophisticated and
inefficient technology. However, in environmental problems we are
concerned with the total planetary system. Under these circumstances
we are literally faced with either increasing the efficiency of the
technological engine from the inside or curtailing its operations.
<P>
<hr noshade size=1>
 <div align=right><a name=10>Page 10</a></div>
<p>
<P> Thus we have the choice before us of
two different types of technological processes. The first type, the
high energy process, has already been shown to contain
contradictions. It has never been demonstrated, to the writer's
knowledge, that such a process, as exemplified by recycled goods, or
installation of pollution control devices, makes possible an overall
abatement of pollution. The second type of process may be called an
&quot;economy process of pollution abatement.&quot; Such a process
does involve a fundamental reduction of both resource consumption and
pollution. However, it may also result in inconveniences, since it
depends on diminished goods and services. A good example is the
substitution of public mass transportation for the private
automobile. Another example is the elimination of luxury goods, which
are the objects of recycling processes and the substitution of goods
of a more frugal nature. It seems unlikely that the high energy
pollution abatement methods will accomplish their objectives, since
they depend upon an undiminished flow of energy, and this energy must
in some way be dissipated.
<P>
</ul>
<H2>ECONOMICS  AND  THERMODYNAMICS</H2>
<ul>
<P>
<P>It has been pointed out  (Boulding,
1968;  Beers, 1970)  that the dominant economic philosophy of our
times, as distinguished from the science of ecology, has developed an
open system approach that takes no account of the ultimate disposal
of the resources utilized by technology. Ecology, on the other hand,
stresses the need for balance and nearly closed cycles in resource
utilization. It is concluded here that not only general economic
policy but also the high energy concept of pollution abatement is
incompatible with the ecologic view and ignores the best known
thermodynamic laws. We must therefore search for economic policies
which are in closer harmony with the cyclic system of nature and
which seek to minimize the energy flux, which feeds technology.

<P>is apparent. The term
&quot;gross residual&quot;, taken from Cumberland <I>et al</I>  (1970),
 is defined as all by-products of production which are waste
materials. We observe that just as there is dissipated energy
component Q<SUB>2</SUB>, which may be diminished by increased
efficiency, so there is a gross residual of production, which may in
part be reclaimed. Similarly to the case of useful work or energy the
product output is eventually entirely dissipated into the environment
as &quot;wearout.&quot; Just as energy becomes increasingly
unavailable toward the right in the diagram, so also the value of
goods are diminished as they wear out.
<P>

<P>To the present time technological
processes have depended on &quot;cost avoidance&quot;  (Olson and
Cumberland, 1970),  by which goods are underpriced to the extent that
they do not include the cost of their disposal in the environment.
Generally the rejected goods, including the pollutants, have been
disposed of in the public domain. New economic policies should demand
that marketed goods include these costs in their prices. In addition
to paying for direct pollution abatement, such a policy would have
the effect of increasing the value of goods so they would not be
falsely rejected before they are worn out. It is obvious that this
would reduce total resource consumption. It is also obvious that such
policy clashes seriously with our dominant life style.

<h2>SUMMARY  AND  CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<ul>
<P>

<P>The technology of man
may be regarded as a heat engine and as such is subject to
thermodynamic principles which govern energy transformations. In this
context pollution in its myriad forms is seen as the agent by which
the total energy input is dissipated into the environment. Pollution
source regions are classified as<I> isolated </I>and <I>non-isolated</I>
regions of our planet that have been modified by technology. Such
regions are distinguished by higher levels of energy flux than the
natural regions from which they were derived. Technologically
modified regions revert spontaneously to natural regions if the
technological energy is withheld and provided no permanent
modifications have occurred. In this scheme thermal efficiency has
pertinence only inasmuch as it enables the total energy input to be
reduced. In this scheme pollution is seen as the inevitable
consequence of the technological energy flux to which the organic
world is not adapted.

<p>
<P> Pollution abatement programs are
classified as either &quot;high energy&quot; or &quot;economy&quot;
processes. Today high energy processes of abatement, which are
characterized by an undiminished energy flux and expanding
technology, are much in the vogue. Typical of these are the proposed
extensive pollution control technologies, which rely on pollution
control devices. By contrast, the economy processes, which depend on
a diminished energy flux through diminished goods and services and
which incur inconveniences, are unpopular.
<P>

<P>The thermodynamic approach to
environmental problems has its parallel in economics. This parallel
is clearly revealed in economic policies that take into account the
ultimate disposal of goods and services by including the cost of this
disposal in the initial price of goods. It is likely that the
recognized parallelism also reflects the underlying thermodynamic
basis for such policies.
<P>

<P>The thermodynamic analysis of
technology exposes the need for comprehensive resource expenditure
inventories, which encompass every aspect of a given project. Such an
inventory must take into account the gross residual and wear
components as well as the product output. In the case of pollution
abatement projects precise energy expenditure inventories, which
cover every aspect of technological expansion, must be undertaken to
determine whether the control program will actually result in an
overall decrease in pollution. It is also clear that the system of
interest in such inventories is the entire planet. Since
technological energy is dissipated throughout the biosphere, a search
must be made for energy dissipation paths that lead to the least
environmental stress. Unfortunately, technological expansion which is
in response to narrow goals is not likely to yield energy forms which
are harmlessly dissipated. Consequently, it seems advisable to seek
economy forms of pollution abatement in order to minimize the energy
flux.
<P>

<P>The need for economy processes in
both resource utilization and in pollution control is also brought
out by recent resource inventories. For example, Hubbert  (1969)  has
shown that the curves of production rate versus time for the major
classes of fossil fuels have a characteristic bell-shape with
distinct maxima which will occur in the near future. For example, the
production rate peak of natural gas from the United States and
adjacent continental shelves exclusive of  Alaska is estimated to
occur about 1980. This type of analysis is likely to have an even
more pressing relevance in the future, especially since the
production of nuclear energy has so many environmental uncertainties.
