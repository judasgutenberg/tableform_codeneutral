<P>The
Virginians for Wilderness' Forests of the Central Appalachians
Project has been posted on our web site since 1998. Since then we've
received a good number of favorable comments and requests for
information from professional ecologists, environmentalists and the
general public. We've tried to respond to each one of these contacts
if at all possible. Unfortunately the same is not true of a number of
professionals who fail to even answer correspondence requesting
reprints or other information for our project. And this number
includes a very large proportion of the most prominent forest
ecologists in the eastern US that have been contacted. I can't accuse
these professionals of arrogance or petulance directed at our web
site, since there may be mitigating circumstances for even such a

large cohort. However, if I were paranoid enough, I might suspect a
conspiracy!</P>

<P>	Humor aside, it may be that a
number, large or otherwise, of professional forest ecologists, who

now possess the authority of journal editorships, or who wish to
maintain the existing virtual print monopoly of information and idea

dissemination, are not quite ready for the Free Range Science now
possible on the World Wide Web. I define Free Range Science as a form

which operates in the absence of all-powerful editorial and other
boards but still adheres to the highest principles of scientific

inquiry, and in which anonymous &quot;peer review&quot; is replaced
by a far more comprehensive &quot;universal review&quot;, anonymous

or not, provided by the World Wide Web. While this practice of
independence at this stage may not favor career advancement, in a

sense it does return scientific communication to its roots. However,
republication by some authors of their papers on the Web, while still

infrequent, is a positive development.</P>
<P>	As part of our project, as an

outgrowth from our inventories, I have critiqued several of forest
ecology's most revered concepts and found them wanting. The simplest

example is the concept of distinguishing climatic, edaphic (soil) 
and physiographic forest climaxes. Although enshrined in

Lucy Braun's brilliant classic <I>Deciduous Forests of Eastern
North America,</I> and still widely embraced, this concept defies

logic when considered in terms of the universal and inevitably
simultaneous influences of climate, substrate and topography, as well

as a number of other energetic factors that govern fundamental
stability. In sum, there is no <I>a priori</I> reason why any one of

these factors should consistently dominate in a given forest type.
For example, although the old growth primary Mixed Mesophyte Forest

type is conventionally considered to be a climatic climax, it is also
 edaphic and physiographic, since it is always the result of rich,

moist soils and generally occurs on dissected topography. Even within
the type, variations such as &quot;acid- mesic&quot; and &quot;calcareous&quot;

sub-types reflect the substrate, which is usually directly related to
the bedrock.</P>

<P>	Another question concerns the
validity of using statistical techniques, such as the various forms

of ordination and gradient analysis to determine the relationships
between forest plant communities. In many of such studies the

abundances of individuals of given species enter prominently.
However, the writer has attempted to make the argument (stability

analysis), by analogy with chemical systems, that the fundamental
stability of a species in a community, and hence that of the

community itself, is likely to be reflected in the <I>presence</I> or
<I>absence</I> of that species rather than in its abundance.

Consideration will show that this postulate is borne out
in nature, where the abundance of individuals of a given species

depends on community history (preceding drought, frost, herbivore
activity, etc.) rather than on the relatively simple relations to

existing climate, substrate or a restricted number of other
environmental factors. Also, the statistical methods cited frequently

entail the lumping together of unlike communities formed on widely
differing substrates to achieve the simplicity necessary for

calculation. In any case, use of average values of critical data is
the norm. If stability analysis is correct, microhabitats, in which

each species is related to every other member of the community, and
individuals are precisely located in relation to substrate,

topographic position, etc., form the most significant subjects of
investigation. It should also be obvious that this concept lies

behind the definition of forest climax as previously discussed. Even
on a stand scale these stability relations are readily apparent in

many cases. This is shown particularly well in <I>Deciduous Forests
Of Eastern North America</I> in which Lucy Braun provides numerous

and still unexcelled co-relations between type of bedrock, 
topographic position and the character of the flora. However, with

the present day emphasis on statistical methods of the type
previously mentioned, such relationships are largely obscured, except

in the most obvious examples. It is necessary to say, however, that
the foregoing is not a blanket condemnation of these statistical

methods, which may have appropriate and powerful applications other
than those discussed above.</P>

<P>	Again, it's not possible to say
whether the views of the writer regarding much current research

played a role in the apparent breakdown in communication cited above,
which is however, unprecedented in his more than forty year

professional career. But perhaps it merely represents a not entirely
unexpected response to the unfamiliar freedom conferred by the World

Wide Web- or is simply coincidental? </P>
