<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.3 8 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.4 Started to build a keyhole manger in Leonardo's pen.
9 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.5<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>9 eggs today.
Don and I cut<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>wood on the hill and I
worked on Leonardo's<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>manger.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.6 Placed a post along B's boundary line and worked on
Leonardo's manger. Only 3 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.7 Worked on Leonardo's manger and tried<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>to dig another post hole. 9 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.8 We had a light rain last night, the first in many
weeks, but it hardly helped our poor depleted cistern! I picked a number of
excellent paste type tomatoes from the slope garden and which I had under a
plastic sheet. Today I discovered another bit of vandalism to the old Chev.
truck-a second severed line to the right rear brake-this the same wheel with a
slashed tire. Apparently this also dates to Halloween night when a window on
the truck was also broken. I fed corn stalks to the big goats this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.9 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Worked on Leonardo's
manger and tried to dig more post holes, 5 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.10<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Brandy may
be in heat since she has been bleating lots today. I finished Leonardo's
manger.( 3 holes) and mounted the clevis on the sledge. 9 eggsd today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov. 11 Another dry but beautiful sunny and warm day. I
worked on the sledge. I don't know howe many eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.12<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A partly
cloudy day (Sunday). 9 eggs today. Don and I cut logs on the hill for firewood.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.13 ** Uncle August died and I inherited 17 acres of
the old homestead in Wisconsin. Received Stark<span class=MsoCommentReference><span

<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Deliceous and Starklodi apple trees (one
of each). Only 3 eggs today. Leonardo has diarrhea. Last night there was a very
light rain. Bought 100 lbs each of corn, oats and mash.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.14<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Planted the
above-mentioned apple trees in the north slope orchard. The Deliceous had very
good looking roots and was a replacement for 2 others which had died in the
same hole. I had soaked the roots the of these two trees planted today for
about 20 hours. I had to carry lots of water up the hill since the soil is
powder down to a foot or more.. 6 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov. 15 Rain, although light, off and on all day.. Betty
milked Honey this evening and got more than a pint, although she was free of
her kids only since noon. Honey would probably give a gallon a day if it
weren't for the kids. 6 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.16<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rain off and
on today-and heavy this night. I worked somewhat on the sledge but did a lot of
reading and writing. 8 eggs today (one very small).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.17 Rain again today-and cool (~50deg.F). Honey appears
to be in heat again, apparently on schedule. Only 2 eggs today! I worked on the
sledge a little.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.18 This was the day of the altercation with our neighbors,
the---s, who were shooting illegally close to the road-and were stopped by us.
Other neighbors also are sympathetic to them, and we fear vandalism. So Betty
bought a pistol and slept in the barn part of the night. 6 eggs today. Don,Gus
and I lugged wood to the trail.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.19 Don and I cut logs on the hill and Betty and I
finished Leonardo's fence. The weather was very pleasant and sunny, but frosts
occur each night. 6 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.20 Finished Leonardo's gate and cut some wood<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>on the hill. 3 eggs today. Betty is milking
mornings and evenings now. We practiced pistol shooting this afternoon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.21 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I had a bad
cold and didn't do much, but placed a lock on Leonardo's outer gate and cut
some wood on the hill. 6 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.22 Cleaned stove. 4 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.23 ( Thanksgiving) The boys and I hauled down a
pick-up load of wood before the rain began. I also killed a chicken. 4 eggs
today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov. 24<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The baby
goats have been weaned fo about a week. Repaired light on barn, fixed fence,
sawed a lot of firewood and went shopping etc. 7 eggs today. Bought 100 lbs of
oats.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.25 i began to cut brush on the back field. I
transplanted a clone from the wild peach ( yielding small, sweet peaches) into
the north slope orchard. 3 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.26 Hauled down another pick-up load of wood, mostly cherry.
We had our first snow today. 6 eggs today. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.27 It rained all night on top of about an inch of snow,
but the ground is still white this morning. 3 eggs today. I dis a little work
on the sledge, read ore wrote most of the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.28 Mostly I sawed up stove wood, did chores
etc.,including Leonardo's usual bag of honeysuckle and coral berry brush. We
began to feed the horses grain and alfacorn [NOTE**]. 9 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov.29 Heavy rain this afternoon. Only one egg today.
Bought 100 lb each of corn and mash.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nobv.30<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Partially
cloudy day. Brandy appears to be in heat. I began to harvest walnuts today. 9
eggs today. Note; Many trees have no walnuts this year but<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>there's a heavy crop of hickory nuts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Dec.1 Scheduled brush cutting-and gathering some for
Leonardo-continued on back field. Also picked and shucked<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>more walnuts, as well as sawed and split a lot

<p class=MsoBodyText>March 26 Noted by Don: An insect or nymph ( stonefly?)
eats mosquito larvae ( in his jars of collected water ). This may explain the
few of the insects we have. [ Note* In addition of the low mosquito densities
most everywhere on our property, we also boast a very low density of other
troublesome insects such as house flies and cockroaches. We believe their
virtual absence<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>in our dwelling results

row of garlic over chicken-goat manure. 22 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>March 28 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Betty
wormed the horses (medicine:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>) I cut
Virginia pine in the back pasture. Gracie had 2 kids ( Albert + Alberta , after
A. Einstein ). She had a hard time., Betty having<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>to turn Alberta before she could<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>come out-all in the presence of thr
Matheneys, who had wanted to be present. Unfortunately Gracie doesn't accept
her kids well and we might have to bottle-feed them. She also dose not act
normal in other respects and we called the vet, although he hasn't come by
10:15 PM. 24 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>March 29 Sold 2 doz. eggs at 70c a doz. The kids seem OK
except<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>that Alberta can't hold up her
head very well. Gracie only eats a little and is still attempting to expel part
of the placenta. She lies around a lot and is difficult to bring to her feet.
Betty milked her some and let the young suck. &quot;Albert&quot; turned out to
be another female! Also, Dr. Marson came this noon and extracted a large dead
buck from Gracie, who had been sinking fast. The buck had begun<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>to rot. He gave her a Combiotic, calcium etc.
and charged $30. I gave him a doz. eggs. He told us to give Gracie 5cc Combiotic
a day ( minimum ) for 5 days or so. and wash off her vagina with soapy water.
13 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>March 30 Gracie died last night and we are sad. She was a
light-hearted goat, a good mother and always wanted to be in the herd. Planted
a 27' row of Salad Bowl lettuce over chicken-goat manure and covered with
compost. &quot;Chocolate&quot; ( formerly Albert ) is now the sole survivor <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>of Gracie's family here and we are feeding her
last year's colostrum, which we froze. She demands many feedings a day (~5
)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and only eats a little at a time-so each
feeding takes a while too. 28 eggs today. Sold 3 doz. eggs for 70c a doz.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>March 31 A beautiful spring day. Everyone is playing with
Chocolate. Planted 25' row of Sugar Snap peas using &quot;nitrogen&quot; and no
fertilizer. I placed post and twine trellis for them. Don and I cut and piled
in gully ( erosion stoppers ) Virginia pines on back pasture. I also spaded the
slope garden. The temp. has been ~80deg.F today. 25 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>April 1<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Betty and I
had Natchez skid a log all the way from the back pasture and on the way a
neighbor deliberately shot and frightened her so that she got one rear leg
tangled in the trace chain. We had quite a time getting her hooked up again.
Betty almost was killed.in the accident. The incident was part of the general
troubles we are having from opposing the paint and body shop of this neighbor..
19 eggs today. Sold 4 doz. eggs at 70c a doz. Our chickens have been treating
us well as we have sold 30 doz. eggs in the past 3 weeks. We appear to be
clearing about 6 dollars a week on them if what we eat is taken into account.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>April 2 We are feeding the horses only a little grain now
(~2 dishes ).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I prepared 4 rows for
potatoes, placing manure in trenches as usual. I also hauled a half pick-up
load of manure to the creek garden. 23 eggs today. The spinach is coming up
nicely in the slope garden.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>April 3 Quite heavy rain most of the day-that prevent
having the high field plowed. I cut potato sets using my own potatoes-which are
heavily sprouted now. 27 eggs today. 27 eggs today.</p>

and placed them in the hive. Betty, on the advice of Shaner, put the bees in in
the morning ( sunny day ). A jar of sugar solution<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1/1 ) was placed in hive entrance. Planted a
45' row of shallots ( my own cloves ) in the slope garden, using no fertilizer.
I also planted<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>four 40' rows of

</span>Hollow Crown parsnip ( no fertilizer ) in the creek garden. 23 eggs
today. Shaner's bees are dying apparently from lack of food. It is depressing
to see them now in one hive at least coming out of the hive and falling to the
ground in a greatly weakened condition.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>April 11 Sold 2 doz. eggs at 70c a doz. I spaded in the
garden and worked on the harrow. 23 eggs today. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>April 12 Sold 1 doz. eggs for 70c. Our bees are

neighbor shot at us so that the bullet ricocheted<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>off a Mueller's Mtn. rock while Betty and I
were walking the goats. We obtained an arrest warrant with the trial set for
May 8. Betty did a first. She opened the bee hive to take the bee cage out and
place more foundation frames. The bees were very good, nobody got stung and
Betty was good too. We were impressed at the amount of comb made since we
placed them in the hive. Gus caught a drone ( for what reason I don't know ).</p>

deep punctures in his leg. 19 eggs today. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>April 22 Betty and I tried to work Natchez to get her to
pull the harrow in the hill field. We managed to have her pull it up there with
me leading and her on the lines. But on the field ewe went very different,
refusing to hold still long enough for us to hook her up. It's plain thart we
will have to work lots more and approach it more slowly if we are to get her to
a serviceable work horse. I also did a fair amount of spading in the gardens. Noted
a worm like that which got on the parsnip year before last, eating off Salad
Bowl lettuce in the slope garden. Betty caught 10 nice fish, the llargest 8.5

it is also attacking apple trees with considerable enthusiasm.<span

to plant field corn. 24 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 8 Quite warm weather. I did another patch of corn

the creek garden and spinach ( very nice ) in the slope garden. Honey seems to
have a very slight case of mastitis in her right udder and we started shots of
Combiotic this evening. 29 eggs today. Betty put a full-sized super on our bees

on pear trees but to a minor degree. They are now copulating and seem to be
less abundant. 24 eggs today. Light rain this evening and it's very warm and

creature<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>is eating the leaves on the cabbage
in the slope garden at a great rate. We are amazed at the way our bees are
going out on such a rainy day. Betty continues to feed them syrup and this

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 8<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Vet visited
Natchez and gave her a shot ( 10 cc ) of Dexdipen for the alergy and<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>recommended<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>that we hoze her down 2-3 times a day. We did it once this morning. He
also recd. that<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>we give her two shots ( 10
cc each ) a day. He charged $21 for the visit. Hauled in 3 WB of good hay from
the flood plain. I have been picking butternuts on Pileated Peak again after
many years when i used to pick them in Wisconsin. It was 45deg.F this morning.
12 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 9<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Planted a
40' band combination of spinach, Cherry Belle radish, Salad Bowl and Bibb
lettuce in the old slope garden potato patch over goat manure trench. Now we
also have a sick goat Maple on our hands in addition to Natchez. After noting a
morning attack of discomfort ( bloating etc. ) this evening at about 8:00 PM,
Maple had a severe attack with head back initially and fell to the ground in a
convulsion, eyes glassy etc. However, she recovered rapidly and by about 9, and
possibly earlier, was<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>chewing her cud.
We administered one cc of combiotic to muscle and seve4ral tablespoons of
mineral oil by mouth followed by several tablespoons of a mixture of 23
tablespoons each of <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>NaCl and baking soda
+ 4 cc of combiotic in a gallon of water. This was prescribed by Dr. Marvas [
spel.?] as treatment for possible enterotoxemia. However, it may be due to
plant poisoning traced to heavy rains similar to Natchez trouble. We hope for
the best. 12 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 10<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maple was
chewing her cud normally this morning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was 41 deg.F ! I threshed out beans. 9 eggs today. Beautiful early
fall weather. I saw a flock of about 10 ruffed grouse on Pileated Peak-another
new dicovery!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 11 Canned 4 qts. of sour kraut. 13 eggs today.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I prepared a sprouting<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>bed on Pileated Pk., cut roots of small beech
tree for transplanting. I also threshed out more beans. Sold 2 doz. eggs at 70c
a doz. Natchez seems to be 90% or more recovered from swollen hind legs,
fetlock joint to hocks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 12<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Noted for
first time honey bees on early goldenrod, although it has been blooming for a
month or more-perhaps due to relatively dry weather recently.. 13 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 13<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cloudy and

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 15 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A
beautiful clear day. This early morning we wormed the goats, except Leo, using
Thibenzole (Thiabendazole ) sheeo, goat and calf wormer. 2.5 gallons for
Brandy, two each for Honey and Jennifer and 1/2 each for the little goats.
Jennifer spit most of it out because she was<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>chewing her cud. We fed lightly after and now can't use milk for 4 days.
*Note this is the first time we wormed our goats since we had them..</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 16<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Noted bees
on many small white asters ( heath asters ? ) on Mueller's Mtn.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>field near the corn field, also on goldenrod.
Also noted great activity at the hive. It appearsd to be a major honey
flow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>14 eggs today. I still have good
cabbage, but pumpkins and squash are failures for several reasons. I'm starting
to get a lot of good tomatoes and peppers of all kinds now.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 17 I threshed pinto beans. Don got lost on Pileated
Peak. 15 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 18 I threshed out more beans and shocked sweet corn
in the slope garden. 11 eggs today. I also picked up more butternuts.</p>

Ruritan &quot;old times&quot; show to watch draft horses, but it was rained
out. 9 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 23<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I picked
almost a peck of butternuts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It's
clearing, cool and windy-fall-like.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
had a good meal of sweet corn and I froze a pint. 9 eggs today. Our sweet corn

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 24<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I froze 3
pts. of hot peppers. and pulled another feed bag of soy beans. 9 eggs today.
Our goats seem to be producing more milk again since we wormed them, perhaps a
pint more a day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sept. 25<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
harvested a <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>feed bag of<span

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 4<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This morning
I canned 7 quarts of tomatoes./ Our bees were very active late in the afternoon
even though it was cool and cloudy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Shaner's hives didn't show much activity. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Also for us is time after observing the busy
bee activity + going for a walk around the hill. [ don't quite get the drift of
preceding ]Gus and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hoagie observed the
drones were being dragged out. I winnowed pinto beans since it was windy. I
also picked a few more butternuts. 9 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 5<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cool rain

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 7 Cool and windy. Both Honey and Brandy are friendly
to the buck and may be in heat. It's a clear, very windy day. Betty and I had
Candy skid down 5 good logs for firewood. 9 eggs today.</p>

in high heat today, but Honey appears to be out of heat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 9 Worked at the grain bin. Weather is cloudy and
rainy. 6 eggs today. The boy's<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>wardrobe
closet from Sears is working<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>out well:
When we get some $ we parents would like one also.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 10<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Snow, about
9 inches of it at 10 AM and 33deg.F this morning. Because<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>of the leaves on the trees still,
particularly the Chinquapin oaks, there is much<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>damage since the snow is so heavy and wet. Also, I shoveled off the barn
roof to play safe. There will be lots of clean-up to do! In addition, our power
is off. Hoagie had to walk to work. She did get a ride on the last part and she
and Nancy Rinker were the first 2 teachers to show up at 8:45 AM. After a hard
day's work ( helped by Gus and to a lesser extent Don ) the good meal and cake
cooked by Hoagie was just the thing. 8 eggs today. It's 33deg.F at about 9:30
PM and that will probably finish my tomatoes and peppers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 11<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>29deg.F
and about 4&quot; of snow is still on the ground.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have stomach flu, but<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I began to clear some of the many trees down
on the trail on Mueller's Mtn. I also worked at the grain bin. 8 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Oct. 12</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct 13</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 14 I've beren really sick with tyhe flu, but today we
all went up the hill with Candy and skidded down some fuel logs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>8 eggs today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Hoagie even split some wood. The sun was out. The bees are hard to
approach. Hoagie's upset that she can't get the queen excluded [ ? ] off the
hive.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 15<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The boys
did <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>odd jobs, including partial clearing
of the trail. 7 eggs today. Bought 100lbs each of corn and oats.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 16<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Honey has a
swollen right jaw, watery right eye and nostrel, and is shivering.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We are calling the vet.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We took Honey to the vet this evening in the
VW ( Honey and Gus ) who, when he heard she had not been in contact with any
strange goats, diagnosed her trouble as<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;lumpy jaw&quot; or &quot;wooden tongue&quot; (
actinmycosis-actinobascillosis ). He gave her a shot of 1.5 cc erythromycin and
advised a drench of Hi-Amine compound powder ( orago salt base ) physiologic
iodine. ( 1.5<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>tsps a day with water ).
Unfortunately, Honey doesn't<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>look
encouraging with a large swollen eye and jaw, although she does eat green
leaves etc. and a little grain. She may not last the night, which would be a
great loss for us. 12 eggs today. I also found a nest of 11 eggs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I continued to work at the grain bin and
clearing the hill road of down trees.[ There is a lesson here for goat and
other animals for keeping,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>provided to
third world inhabitants, since vet services are likely not available. ]</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 17 It was the most beautiful<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>warm day ( 70s). I worked at the grain bin.,
picked ( from the corn disaster! ) some cobs for next year's seed and some wild
pears. Honey seems gradually<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>to have
improved since last night and now eats quite well, although her right face is
still greatly<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>swollen. 8 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 18 Honey seems gradually to have improved throughout
the day after a very swollen headed morning. She did a lot of independent
grazing and browsing late this afternoon. However, we did not note independent
cud chewing yet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her swelling<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>might have gone down a little and she
ate<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>quite a bit of grain this evening.
The kids continue to nurse when possible and we continue to dose her with
medicine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>7 eggs today and I worked at
the grain bin. Also, Hoagie and Gus finally winterized the bees.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 19 I had a touch of the flu again and didn't do much.
Honey grazed a lot but doesn't chew her cud much. [ sore jaw! ] Her right head
is still badly swollen. 7 eggs today. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 20<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
morning Brandy appeared ill!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We began
giving her the same treatment as as Honey. who appears to be improving. Brandy
seemed only slightly under the weather during the day and was managing to
graze, chew her cud etc. Her morning illness took the form of shivering and
failure to eat. This evening she ate quite well. Don and I cut up firewood logs
for the horse to skid<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and cleared<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a down tree from the trail. 6 eggs today. The
weather is very warm tonight and we have been enjoying Indian summer weather.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 21<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Betty and I
took Candy to the hill ( Mueller's Mtn. ) and skidded four logs back weighing a
total of about 1000 lbs ( in 4 loads ). 10 eggs today. The weather is very mild
and clear with temps in the 70s. The goats, particularly Honey, continue to do
well, except that Brandy has a limp.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 22 Very warm weather. I worked hard all day finishing
clearing the trail, cleaned stove, threshed soy beans, split logs etc. This
evening we had a bad episode with Honey while drenching her-she<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>banged her sore head on the wall and went
into shock. But after getting her to her feet she began to eat as if little had
occurred!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, her eye even before
the blow, looked bad-as if she could lose it or at least sight since it
appeared to have a lesion on the eye ball and is still badly infected. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>However, she has shown steady improvement. We
stopped treating Brandy , having given her no shot or drench this morning. All
the goats spent a lot of time on the hill today. 11 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 23<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I worked on
the grain bin. All goats seem well except HJoney who may not make it because of
eye. 9 eggs today. The weather was rainy, but cleared and cooled in late
afternoon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bought 100 lbs of mash.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 27<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had a
heavy frost last night. We began to<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>spray Honey's sore eye with pink eye spray. Don and I cut and luggrd
wood to the trail. 6 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oct. 28<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don and I
hauled down a load of wood from the hill using the truck. Candy hurt her leg,
probably ?,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and we bathed her and gave
her 12 ccof combiotic. Her leg was quite swollen ( left rear ). We had planned
to use her fir skidding but could not. I also prospected for wood and cut some
trails on Pileated Peak. 8 eggs today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The weather was mostly cloudy, not too cool and it rained lightly.</p>

</span>Bought 100 lbs of oats.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov. 2 Since yesterday we only gave Honey a shot every
other day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I mostly worked on the grain
bin since we had heavy rain all day. 4 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nov. 3<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Clear and

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Weather is clear and cool. 6 eggs today. We
gave<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Candy a shot of combiotic as her
wounds looked worse, although she is not lame.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She may be developing superficial<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>proud flesh.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We stoped Honey's

the grain bin and placed 3 bags of corn ( from the hill as R cobs ) to

a chill the last several windy, cold days. It appears we placed them outside
too soon-a lesson to us. The soil is very wet so that plowing is further

out great!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>April 21 I began spading the creek garden where I didn't
spade last year and found coral berry and honeysuckle. While getting pine
boughs on PP for the goats I noticed a raven fly over chased by two crows and
confirmed its call, since the size difference was so apparent. The call
however, is not a hoarse croak as described in the books, but a rather
high-pitched melodic note that carries far and wide. Mr. Varner plowed the hill
field and I gave him $22.00, although he wanted only $20.00. ~30 eggs today.</p>

tomatoes are also doing well. Cabbage in the creek garden is doing well. So far
there has been no cabbage worm damage since the butterflies appeared late this

the clay. i also again sampled the water flowing out of the marsh, where it is

slight cold in the nose. 7 eggs today.</p>

this morning, but a very light east wind allowed our house incl. basement to
stay fairly warm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our goats are still
grazing particularly on the flood plain and we have fed them hay only about
twice. I switched Leo's ration to pine boughs today, having given up on coral
berry and honeysuckle.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Dec. 22<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>our water
intake to the stream broke and our pump stopped working so that we had the

<p class=MsoBodyText>Dec. 28<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Last night
Hoagie fed the kids from a bottle by the stove. This morning they had a good
suck from Maple. Hoagie stuck her arm up Maple's vagina to look for placenta
and then gave her a slight douche , after which she perked up a little. Later
she found apparently ) 2 discarded placentas in the stall where Maple had been
with the other goats. Maple still eats very little-only a few nibbles of
berries and grain. Everything is slick with frozen drizzle. 6 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Dec. 29<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A misty,
ice-covered day. The two kids of Maple died last night and<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maple is still not feeling well. She gives
only a few spoons full of milk so far. The goats are grazing on the flood plain
this afternoon as I write this. I have switched to gathering pine for Leo, but
Betty ( who is on a 16 day vacation ) gathers brush, berries etc. for the does.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Dec. 30<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A somewhat
cloudy and misty day. But the goats got taken on a walk and grazed on the flood

later to warm her up some since she didn't suck. 9 eggs today. We had a light
snow this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan. 1 The boys, Hoagie and I skidded down 10 logs from PP

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan. 8 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I found
Sunday, Jennifer's runt, dead this morning, perhaps smothered during the night

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan. 9<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sold one
doz. eggs for 80c. Note this is the first price rise sale. 10 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan. 10<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Last night
separated both sets of kids from their mothers for the first time, chiefly to
prevent any being smothered. However, we also got some good milk this morning
because of it. Raisin behaved rather strangely, not wanting her kids to suck
for a while, perhaps because her bag hurt from being too full. We disbudded
Raisin's kids today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan. 11 Cold ,dry weather continued. We cleaned the house
etc. Betty took the goats for a walk, including the kids. 11 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan 17 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Hoagie
thought Brandy was looking fat and possibly pregnant for the past week. Gave
away 1.5 qts. of goat milk. [Looked for ]The possible babies<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>move without success. Today<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bob, Hoagie and Gus observed the kids moving,
so Brandy is pregnant. But when did she get pregnant ?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was one time placed with the buck and all
she was observed doing was running frantically from him. She never did show a
strong heat, only rather &quot;bucky&quot; behavior. On Dec. 2 she showed
strange playful behavior. Is this when she was bred ?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her pregnancy looks much more advanced than
that-time will tell ??? In a dog walk Wilbur chased off another dog that was
much larger. It was on other land.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan. 18<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don and I
cut up more of the large down red oak we worked on yesterday also. We tattooed
December P2 and Carob P3.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maple is not
doing well. I ( Betty ) took the goats for a long walk and got her to eat some
brush. Carla came and rode Natchez, while I rode Candy. Don found a dead male
pheasant, which had a broken neck, probably from smashing into a tree. It was
stiff and in the process of beginning to rot. Gus payed Don $2.00 for the
worthless carcass. Gus skinned it very well considering ( I hate to brag. ).
yesterday don found a starling dead in the hayloft, and it probably died of the
same cause as it had a broken beak. It's intestines were lying out<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>to the side. Saw a Great Blue heron. It has
been staying for the winter and past winters. Very warm today. Bees cleaned out
hives. Saw a raven doing a stunt very high in the air, nearly flipping over as
the stunt, calling &quot;Rhooochk, Rhooochk.&quot; Maple is in poor shape. Lumpy
jaw seems to be encroaching.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan. 19<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bees were
out again and it was quite mild. I cleaned the stove and pipes today. 13 eggs
today. Bought 100lbs each of corn, mash and alfalfa pellets.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan. 20<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The stream
rose a little, although there has been no precipitation, presumably due to warm
weather [ Not likely! more probably due to diminished water given off by
evapotranspiration in the absence of greenery ]. I split up the big red oak
into 28 pieces. I also carried a bucket of chicken manure to the apple trees on
PP. 14 eggs today. Hoagie made mozzarella cheese. type H. Bird news: It appears
that I saw 2 woodcock flying down by the swamp</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan. 21 Light rain and light snow last night. I skidded
one log from PP. Sold one doz. eggs for 80c. 15 eggs today. Bird news:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I, Betty, saw a killdeer at close range today
by the great willow tree near the creek garden. They are beautiful birds and
have falcon-like wings but long bills A pair of killdeer hang out in this area.
The swamp has been melting for the last two days and the water level is
increasing. Ceno.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Neugh., odd little
yellow<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hen-chick ( who is not a chick
anymore, but a large-combed hen, had a sort of humped-up look, and I think she
may be egg-bound, though she eats well. All the new hens have thin combs as
never before ( all those from Neughstrom ), and they are rarely large, although
the roosters have thick combs. I saw Ceanopteryx [spel?] get raped by Archaeo
for the first time yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan. 22 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I skidded 4
logs down from PP, now having accumulated 5, a good pick-up load of firewood.

bees flew again today. Maple is in bad shape. I have been forcing Hi-artine [?]
powder [?] salt base, physiologic Iodine via drench with a coke bottler and
water. She has quit drinking and almost all eating except she does consume
minerals.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan. 25 Hoagie made mozzarella cheese, type H2 with one
gallon milk, and it came out fine for the second time. Hoagie took the goats for
a walk. Maple followed along but hardly etc. Hoagie forced some water down her
throat and later repeated the drench. Maple is still urinating, passing goat
berries, but they are very dry. Also, I noted that she was spitting up rumen[?]
this morning ( PICN ), so now the mineral box is loaded with minerals.[ I,( Bob
) don't know if my translation of this passage is correct. ]</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jan. 26 Hoagie made terrific cheese. 4 eggs today. Bought
100 lbs each of corn, oats and mash.</p>

got out quite a few days.</p>

afflicted by the most monotonous weather in my memory, always dry, unusually
cold with an east wind ( light ), sun or cloud with very weak storm fronts,
giving hardly a drop or flake. What moisture there is in the top soil is held
there by the frost. How we could use a good heavy snow! 23 eggs today</p>
