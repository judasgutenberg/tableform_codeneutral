hard cheese. I noted that, although the heavy rains of the past week seemed to
exceed that needed by the garden plants, most seem to have put on much new
growth, the beans, for example, put on whole tier of light green leaves 6&quot;
or more in height, and the corn grew several feet in some cases. Cabbage, unfortunately,
tended to crack somewhat. The apples on PP appear to be about half grown in
terms of volume.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>July 9 Made third batch of hard cheese. Maggie is setting
overnight in her nest by the corner of the barn. I dug a posthole on the MM

again as I write this. at 9:00 PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May 27 Besides going to town shopping, I did some weeding in
the gardens. It's raining again this evening as it did last night. 18 eggs
today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May 28<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I finally had
to hoe in the gardens, although the soil is too wet. I hoed corn and beans in
the slope garden and beans in the creek garden. 20 eggs today. It rained again
during the night and a little during the day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May 29<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Gus and I
fixed the fence by the bees. I hoed the potatoes and beans in the slope garden
and potatoes and corn in the hill field. Although there are lots of potato
beetles in the slope garden, there are few as yet in the hill field. Also,
while<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>there are abundant flea bettles in
the slope garden, there are almost none in the creek garden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May 30 Fairly heavy rain and thunderstorms much of last
evening and night and continuing this morning. Gus, Hoagie and I placed wire
along the garden down to the flood plain ready for stretching.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>weeded and place brush for peas in the slope garden. I picked a qt, of
wild strawberries on the PP slope. It's very warm and humid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May 31<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>planted 7
hills of Longgreen<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and 3 hills of
National Pickling cucumbers<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>over manure
in the creek garden and weeded in the hill field. This evening I also hoed (
mostly corn ) in the hill field. 18 eggs today + ~5 eaten by the chickens, who
have become very bad.</p>

hills of Small Sugar pumpkin, all over liberal manure in the creek garden. I
picked another qt. of wild strawberries and about a pt. of tame. 28 eggs today,

in the hill field. The boys and I hauled 5 WB loads of hay with rain
threatening. I did a quite a bit of weeding in the hill field. We had at least
30 eggs today, of which 27 were collected. It's rainiong as I write

on, but the goats got up the hill. I fed Leo hay. ~20 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 5<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I did a lot of
weeding in the hill field soy beans and some in the corn as well as the beans
in the creek garden and carrots in the slope garden. Rabbits are very bad on
the soy beans. we had at least 24 eggs, but a number were eaten by a bad
egg-eating chicken who has survived only because she's an old acquaintance !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 6 I hoed the corn and cabbage in the slope garden,
cleared the rhubarb and horseradish of weeds and hoed 3 rows of soy beans in
the hill field. I also scraped the NE side of the house again and sawed and
split wood. All vegetation is very lush and the weather very pleasant with cool
nights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 7<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I cut hay in
the back yard and hoed soy beans. Planted 17 Cayenne pepper plants. The boys
began to hoe corn. Collected 15 eggs, but the chickens ate quite a few others.</p>

grass in the yard. We hauled in one WB of hay. I hoed another row of soy

a qt. of cauliflower.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Light rain this
evening halted Gus and I from hoeing on the hill, but Don did some earlier.
Some corn is now over knee high and some soy beans are doing well despite the rabbits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 10<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had heavy
rain last night and scattered showers during the day. 17 eggs today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 12<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hoed 2 rows
of soy beans, although<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the soil was a
bit wet. ( Note<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>it can be hoed on the
hill only after a fairly hard rain. ) However it then began to rain and we have
been having had showers all day. I froze a pt. of podded peas. Bought 100 lbs
each of corn, oats and mash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 13 Rain, heavy at times, all night and morning,
clearing partially this afternoon. Many mushrooms are appearing. Betty and I

<p class=MsoNormal>June 14<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Pearl,
Hoagie's little black hen, had chicks sometime during<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the night. This morning she was seen with a
brown-black and a grey-black chick. Wilbur isn't feeling too well in this hot,
humid, flea-infested climate of June. The boys and I hoed corn and soy beans
and I cut hay in the slope garden and flood plain. I also patched the roof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 15<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Planted a 20'
row of Tampala [?] ( Burpee ) in the slope garden. over liberal manure. We

<p class=MsoNormal>June 19 [ Material under this date consists of details by
Gus of animals etc. and is not presented. ]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 20 I hoed 2 rows of soy beans and pulled a lot of corn
for thinning purposes. Note, I've been storing these thinnings as &quot;hay&quot;
in addition to giving them to Leo. The field<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>corn is now more than knee high on average and some is chest high. The
soy beans cover about 1/4 of the ground and some as much as a third, despite
heavy rabbit damage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 21 ( Summer's first day ) I cut a large patch of hay on
the flood plain consisting of a variety of wild plants, but including some red
and white clover. The boys hoed corn and I planted about 10 more VF tomato
plants in the creek garden. 16 eggs today.</p>

patch of hay on the flood plain. Sold 10 doz. eggs at 80c a doz. I began<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>to mulch tomatoes in the slope garden and the
boys hoed corn.</p>

fixed fence, stretching wire along the garden fence.. Don and I<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>repaired the main flood plain gate and we
hauled in 3 WB of hay from the floodplain. 23 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>25<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Gus and I fixed fence by the barn and we,
incl. Hoagie, rolled a roll of wire up the hill. I weeded the slope garden and
watered tomatoes in the same garden. I placed Dipel on the<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>slope garden cabbage and cauliflower using
last year's Dipel. ~16 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 26<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I did some
hoeing in the creek garden, but mostly we all did house cleaning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Bryants visited with a shish ka bob of
goat.</p>

of peas and hoed and weeded in the creek garden. Sprayed the cabbage and cauliflower
with Dipel, thereafter noting extensive<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>cabbage worm evidence. I also picked bean beetle evidence in the slope
garden and weeded the carrots and finished weeding and thinning the sweet corn,
the earliest of which is beginning to tassel<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>now. 17 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 28 Gus and I patched fence on B's boundary<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>using new woven wire. 18 eggs today. I picked

garden dead from the Dipel application. Bought 100 lbs each of corn, oats and
mash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 28 Light rain this morning and a heavier shower in the
