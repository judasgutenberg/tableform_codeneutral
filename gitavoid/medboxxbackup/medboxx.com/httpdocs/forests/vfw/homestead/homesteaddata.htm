<h1>Homestead<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></h1>

<p class=Byline>by R.F.Mueller</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>In a sense Homestead is an archetype of the &quot;back
to the land&quot; movement that rests on the basics but drags some urban
amenities along, making use of supplementary oil heat, refrigeration and
electricity in general. However, with few exceptions, mechanical power expended
is largely human and animal, with machines playing only a supplementary role.
Typically, common spading takes the place of mechanical tillers and hand
crosscut saws that of chain saws. It relates the basics of supplying shelter,
water and food and in coping with adversity. It illustrates the importance of
timing in working with nature. Thus raising vegetables<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>can be followed from initial soil preparation
and seeding to harvest and crop disposal and storage. Tenets employed are
predominantly organic, avoiding industrial chemicals in coping with pests and
problems generally. I hope errors and disasters are included as faithfully as
triumphs. From the start our efforts were favored not a little by rich
limestone-based soils, a gentle climate and our lack of indebtedness on our
land and possessions. Our dwelling and most of the land of this tract is
located on a southeast slope, which enables an early start to our growing
season. Additionally our yard is characterized by a magnificent stand of mature
Chinquapin Oaks (<i> Quercus muhlenbergii </i>), which, with a large Norway
Maple ( <i>Acer platanoides </i>), provide us with summer cooling and countless
other amenities. Also, not a little of the natural assets of the place is owed
to the presence of the strong, year-round-flowing Folly Mills Stream.
Although<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the natural beauty of the place
owes a lot to the hilly character of the land, this also severely limits the
arable land available. It also helped a lot that both Betty and I came from
rural backgrounds, as well as having advanced degrees, in my case in geology. Additionally,
Betty had considerable practical knowledge of animals. To be found here in
particular, is a rich detail of goat breeding and handling for milk and meat
production, bee keeping and horse care and handling. So mostly we knew what to
expect from most enterprises launched. Part of the impetus for passing along
these experiences is the likelihood that the simple, low energy life style and
skills they embody will assume a far greater importance in the future. Perhaps
an extreme version of this life style is hinted at in the useful, if limited,
foraging represented by fishing and the dandelion and cress salads mentioned. Additionally
the accurate timing should give our observations considerable phenological value.

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><u>Homestead, which consists of about 29 acres of hilly
land and a small swamp, is located in Augusta County,Virginia, in the heart of
the Shenandoah Valley. at<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>latitude 38 15
North. and near 1500 ft. ( 457 meters ) in elevation. Bedrock is Paleozoic in
age, and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>predominantly<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>magnesium-rich limestone in composition, Our
house, which has a rude earth floored basement, has 700 sq, feet of living
space and indoor plumbing. There also is an oil furnce in the basement. Suffice
to say the building is drafty, and leaks were common until we put on a new
metal roof. Note also that a &quot;species&quot; of livestock feed I call
&quot;alfacorn&quot; is according to my dear wife Betty ( who shared all these
experiences ), not really a valid one. and represents some type of feed not
identified. Also, it will be noted that spelling leaves something to be
desired.<o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Prelude immediately before April 19, 1975 entry: <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Purchased this farm in Spring 1975 from Ernest R. Rowe,
with closing on March 19.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>April 19,1975 <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Came to farm and took over from Mr. Rowe. Also
planted two grape vines, a Concord and a Caco [ ? ]<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Later planted a garden consisting of onions, parsnips,
radishes, lettuce, carrots, beans, cucumbers, watermelons, tomatoes, collards.
Betty and I picked a quite a few blackberries in July and she made jam. The
children and all of us did a good deal of fishing on all of our visits,
catching what appeared to be large chubs and one sucker.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug 8-11 On this trip highlights were Betty baking
blackberry cobbler, finding several peach trees and an excellent garden
location above the flood plain just below the hill [ called &quot;slope
garden&quot; by us ]. We also located a heavily laden Crab apple tree. We
estimate the peaches will be ripe in about 3 weeks to a month and perhaps 2
weeks for the crabapple. I harvested one large cucumber and the watermelon has
several tiny ones on. Also the carrots, parsnips an tomatoes are doing well. I
pulled the last of the onions. We also visited Mr. Heizer, one of our bordering
neighbors who told us about the new garden location. Last night we heard
Screech Owls- the first I had heard in many years.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 24 ( Sun.) We arrived here yesterday afternoon
from Lanham. Since then we have been enjoying the place again. Today I gathered
cattail bulbs, roots etc. and about a half a peck of crabapples which Betty
intends to use for sauces. pies etc. I also purchased a four tined hoe for
gathering the cattails but found my hands seemed to work best. So far the
&quot;cattail flour&quot; experiment seems to be a failure. The crabapples seem
to be the native American variety, and there seems to be about several bushels
on the tree. This morning Betty caught six small chus for breakfast. and
tonight we intend to eat the cattails. I also found my garden doing quite well
and harvested 3 large cucumbers. It is raining as I write this and water is
running in the cistern.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug 27 We have been enjoying the place. Yesterday we
had a second meal of cattails. Betty and I are real enthusiasts. I gathered
them for the first time barefoot. We manage to like even what Gus calls
&quot;dim[?]tail&quot; the starchy enlargement at the base of the stem. I am
also drying crabapples and we're all gobbling peaches, which are just beginning
to ripen. This morning we had four nice fish for breakfast. ( yesterday we had
a dozen or so ), one being a 9.25 inch sucker, golden in color. I am making a
&quot;compost' pile or rather &quot;windrow&quot; along the newly discovered
hill base garden spot. I tossed dark ( organic rich ) thick sods from the edge
of the floodplain to the garden edge. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>{ This is followed by a diagram of the flood plain,
slope garden and hill [ &quot;Mueller's Mountain&quot; ] from the stream to the
hill top. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Presumably these clods contain nutrients, including N
in the plant material. Hopefully these will be stored for use next spring in
the garden. This resembles practices of the Chinese. As i write this Betty is
going to a meeting with Mi Clarkson, a horse breeder. The children are enjoying
their tree home and rope. Yesterday I bought a wheelbarrow for $50.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 29 Scored one! Betty caught ten small fish.
Weather continues nice. I am drying more crabapples. Yesterday Betty and I
prepared holes on the Mtn. for 2 apple andf one pair tree. Last night we had a
great meal of sweet corn ( from Heizers ), hamburger, fresh biscuits and
crabapple cobbler. I'm also repairing chinks in the basement door.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug 31I caught a severe head cold last night and a m
lying around sick and feverish today. Yesterday evening we feasted on cattails
again. Now this evening I spent some time getting acquainted<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>with the plumbing and this afternoon took a
walk up the hill ( despite my cold ) and discovered a wild pear tree on top.
This tree's loaded with small pears the size of crabapples ( ~2&quot; ).
yesterday I also cut some more poles and noted that a 17 yr. old mockernut grew
2' 4&quot; this year although may be unusual because of all the rain. The
weather continues hot and dry.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Sept 1Tomorrow early we return to Lanham after a great
10 days. It rained quite heavily last night but it is fine cool weather<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>now.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Betty is fishing again as I write this. We have been picking peaches
from a tree and apples from the hill behind Shipes.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Sept. 28 ( Sun. ) We came here evening of the 26 th and
return this evening. The weather has been beautiful after heavy rains. We have
been picking apples, walnuts and a few wild pears. Betty caught some nice fish,
one 9&quot; or- {?} and last night we had cattails. We also had an outdoor fire
last night and this evening. I also harvested some excellent cucumbers and
tomatoes. I also assembled my prefab sawbuck. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>[ which amazed Betty ! ]<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Oct. 11We arrived yesterday evening after putting our
Lanham house up for sale. The morning dawned beautifully after heavy rain last
evening. Betty caught a number of fish, the largest being 2 10&quot; suckers
that retained spawn. The day was beautiful and we went to Staunton to shop for
material to caulk the house. I collected walnuts and apples. This evening we
again built a fire. We also collected the watermelon , which was good but not
completely ripe. The tomatoes had been frozen some time ago as were the
cucumbers, but the carrots and parsnips were in good shape. I went home early
but Betty and the boys stayed the week. This trip Betty caught a 12 and
1/4&quot; sucker, also an 11 incher.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Oct. 25-28 Although fishing has been poor. we have been
making finds such as nut trees, in particular hickory nuts. Today( 28 ) we
found a mockernut loaded with particularly large nuts. Yesterday Betty made
cookies with hickory and walnuts. We had a lovely fire last night and I did a
lot of talking. I also continue to collect and process walnuts. We enjoyed a
meal of the first parsnips. Saw a flock of Bluebirds on the Mountain.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Nov. 7-10 The weather is very unusual.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today ( Nov. 8 ) it was bright and sunny,
with temp. in the 70s. I finally fixed the back porch storm door, installing
the plexiglass with my own &quot;stick&quot; holders. I also planted a 10 ft.
double row of Jerusalem artichokes, picked more walnuts an hickory nuts as well
as a store of bittersweet. Gus and I are here alone ( with Wilbur [our Labrador
Retriever ] , while Betty remains with Don in Lanham. Last night she called and
said we had our first &quot;contract&quot; offer on the house. I also saw my
first squirrel live here- a red.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Nov, 26-30 ( 27th and Thanksgiving day ) and today we
all planted the first trees, which Shipes had heeled in the garden for us.
These trees, obtained from Stark Bros., consisted of two Montmorency cherries,
one Dutches Pear, one Golden Delicious apple. We planted the cherries near the
house and the rest on the north slope of Mueller's Mtn. Yesterday also, Bobby
Shipe shot a deer.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Dec. 12-14 ( Dec. 14 ) Don, Gus and I are spending a
short weekend here. On the way down we had to replace a generator brush in the
VW, Fortunately, we found the &quot;Metric&quot; VW garage at Luray. Yesterday
I also bought a 1959 Chev<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>1/2 ton truck
from Mr. Taylor, a neighbor down the branch. We also cut a small Virginia pine
for a Christmas tree and put up some flashing lights in the window.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Dec. 24-Jan. 4 Good Christmas here today (26 Dec,)
Betty caught 11 fish including a 13and 3/4 inch sucker ! Last night we had
sleet and power went off for a few hours. Sunday 28 I will return to Lanham.
Spaded<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>( Jan. 2 ) 30' x 12' garden plot
at base of hill. Still good fishing.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<h2>Jan.16 1976 Here for weekend; mostly frozen solid.</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Jan. 22-25 Quite cold and frozen. Noted ( on 23 ) that
hearwood of black walnut is far more resistant to insect attack and decay (
particularly the latter ) than the sapwood so that old logs with the sapwood
almost entirely gone are still usable and in fact very sound and attractive
with their beautiful grain. I have been making simple &quot;artifacts&quot; from
this walnut, fish cleaning boards, stools etc. Today also the afternoon was
bright and sunny with T= 43 deg, F and more in the sun. We are as usual
enjoying ourselves and nature here.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Feb. 8 The boys and I spent weekend here, mostly to
check up on the place. Weather moderately cold but sunny ( 14 deg. Feb.7 ).
Mostly tried to build a bench, gathered more walnut.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Feb. 15-17 Left Lanham Friday 13 morning and have been
busy here ever since. I spaded more garden so that I now have a 12'x 60' patch
on the slope above the flood plain. Yesterday Betty baked a chocolate cake for
Gus' birthday ( which is today, <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>16th ) and we gave him my old hand axe for a present. I
had had had it for about 35 years although I recently made a new handle and
case. Today I cut brush around the wild crabapple tree. I have also been making
objects such as White oak mauls, walnut stools etc. The weather is so warm the
boys are splashing in the stream as I write this. Gus is in his bathing suit. I
also collected some excellent parsnip yesterday. Tomorrow morning we return to
Lanham.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Feb. 26-30 It is 60 deg. as I write this on the 27th (
much warmer in the sun ) ( It was 32 deg. this morning ) and the peach buds are
starting to open. I have been spading the side hill garden again and now
have<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a 12'x70' patch. I also place 2
wheelbarrow loads of manure ( well rotted ) ( cow ?) and full of red worms around
the peach tree. I have been cooking outside ( i am here alone ) on the new
30&quot; x 30&quot; x 1/4 &quot; steel plate I bought from Augusta Steel. This
appears to work very well, not smoking the pans and allowing a variety of
heats. The weather is quite dry and I haven't even tried to go fishing so far.
I have also been cutting poles and have as yet noticed no sap rising in the
oaks.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Feb. 28 Today I finished preparing 3-70' rows, with 2
WB of WR manure / row for potatoes. (T) I also planted a 40' row of<span

This is another warm dry day, bad for fruiting buds. Also Bobby Shipe<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and Gary [Lape ] caught a large number of
very large suckers (~15&quot; and some 18&quot; ! ) as well as some small trout
at Bobby's fishing hole [ just across the road ]<o:p></o:p></b></p>

sassafras tea and eating dandelion salads. Betty has been working on leather
covers for the old couch cushions, The boys have been enjoying the stream as
usual, having gone swimming on Friday. Wilbur is<span

spade. I also spaded a 10' x 7' asparagus bed in what may be virgin soil. It is
on the slope near the Jerusalem artichoke bed, very dark deep friable and full
of worms. I also put up a grape arbor for the two vines planted last spring.

pickings, there are quite well taken care of. It has not rained for the past
few days, but it is still so wet that I cannot place fence posts in the flood
plain to protect the slope garden, As a consequence Natchez is overgrazing the
small barn yard pasture [ later called &quot;goat pasture&quot; ] where she has
been since we got her. Betty and the boys chop thistles each day. This evening

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>July 25 Its a bright sunny day and cool after several

wild strawberries ? The latter were abundant there. By contrast, the tomatoes
in the creek garden, where there were no strawberries, show no sign of wilt
yet. Today Betty made 7 more jars of blackberry jam, the berries being at their
peak. I also made another 2 crocks of sour kraut. Yesterday I dug another
basket of potatoes ( Kennebecks ), and these were the best yet as to yield,

require watering again today. These green striped pumpkins seem to set fruit
late. far later than the Lady Godivas. The creek garden is doing well. Although
infected with wilt, the tomatoes of the slope garden are not dieing as sat as
at first. Does the power of wilt decline in dry weather? Betty has been trying
to trim Natchez's hooves in the stall, but has found that she tries to pull

for the most part. It has also been cool, with nights in the 50s . The early
cabbage continues good and does not rot rapidly as in Lanham at this time of
year. The kidney beans and other beans look good and are not affected by
chlorosis as were the early beans I planted, since I had not placed any ashes
in close proximity. We plan to eat our fourth meal of GB sweet corn this
evening. I am continuing to fence on the mountain, and Betty and I have nearly
finished the old fence between the Bellangers and us.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 5 Made another batch ( 2 qts. ) sour Kraut and
Betty soaked in water pickles for Kosher dills. She also strained the
blackberry wine and added sugar.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 6 Yesterday i harvested ( after previous cutting )
a half pickup box of rye from the mtn. I thresh4ed it with a baseball bat and
winnowed it in the wind and obtained about 10 lb of rye [ grain]. Today Betty
made kosher dills ( 9 qts. ), including 2 qts. of green tomatoes. The rabbits
have again decimated my beans, especially the nice wax bean plants planted 6-1
in the slope garden. The weather continues very dry and hot, The Japanese
beetles are very bad on the sweet potato vines now.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 9 Two days ago we butchered 2 more Cornish
roosters and yesterday evening we ate 9 crayfish caught by the Shipe children
in the stream. They were very good boiled a few minutes. The weather continues
dry except for a few light rains. I am trying to snare rabbits, but they manage
to escape so far by chewing the wire through, [ really woodchucks ?] Planted
35' row of Dwarf Green Curled Kale ( same as failed in spring ) in creek garden
where peas had been.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 11 Yesterday Don, Gus and I watered the pumpkins
and squash, late cabbage and peppers in the slope garden. Also, the rabbit [ or
woodchuck ], which continues to decimate my bush beans, chewed through the
picture wire snares 3 times now. Yesterday I blocked off his main hole through
the fence. The Japnese beetles are tapering off and scarcely affecting the corn
now. The late cabbage is forming small heads now and the Country Gentleman corn
is forming cobs. Dug a basket of potatoes from the creek garden. Some of these
were eaten, probably by muskrats. Yield seems good.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 12 Dug another basket of potatoes in creek garden.
A considerable number of these were partially eaten. We also watered the
popcorn, as the weather continues very hot and dry.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 13 Watered the pumpkins, squash, melons, asparagus
and Am. artichokes in the slope garden. *Caught a large snapping turtle today
at the edge of the cattail marsh in a flowage area. We are at this moment
stewing it in our largest pot. I also harvested<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 15 the cucurbits are still doing very well and
especially I have numerous pumpkins. All are growing rapidly. Especially
prolific have been the Straight Neck Yellow Summer s quash, of which i have one
hill. I have given great quantities to our neighbor and today fed them raw to
our chickens, who appear to be fond of them. We froze 2 qts. of turtle stew,
which we enjoyed greatly. Wilbur would not eat turtle meat at first, but now
does. Unfortunately the Japanese beetles are still severe in the creek garden,
where they are again beginning to attack the corn silk of my excellent Country
Gentleman as well as sweet potato leaves. I am continuing to fence in the hill
orchard. Betty strained the blackberry wine for the second time and is making
grape wine out of grape juice today!<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 18 Yesterday we canned 8 more qts. of sour kraut.
Today we watered pumpkins, squash, [?] and cowpeas in the slope garden. We are
finally eating a few tomatoes, but these are of bad quality, showing end rot, perhaps
due to a combination of dry weather and wilt weakening the plants. However, the
tomato plants in the creek garden appear excellent, although these plants have
yielded no ripe fruit as yet. I also cut 5 locust posts of 11' length for a
chicken fence.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 20 Betty made 2.5 gallons of mead today, after we
went wild and drank a lot during the Republican convention. We also butchered 2
more roosters yesterday and they were about 5 lbs a piece dressed. As usual, we
ate one and froze one. I placed<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>2 WB of
fresh horse manure, picked up from the field only potato patch of the slope
garden, making 3 WB in all placed there since I harvested the potatoes.
Everything in the creek garden is growing well despite the drought, which
continues. The late carrots especially seem to be growing fast. The Japanese
beetles are still very severe on the sweet potatoes and corn. The popcorn is
quite stunted in the slope garden however, from the drought I assume, but it
has begun to set ears. Bought another 100 lb bag of chick grower.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aud. 23 Watered the popcorn, hot peppers and sweet
potatoes in the slope garden again! Raccoons bothered corn in the creek garden

asusual, although not finished working yet.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 27 Light rain today, the first in a long time.
Blister beetles have been quite severe for weeks on beets. Yesterday I watered
cantaloupes, cucumbers, asparagus in the slope garden. The cantaloupe there are
ripening fast, although quite immature. They are very tasty however. I have
been working on a chicken fence to avoid our watching them. This involves
making another gate for which I split a large white oak log left over from
logging and well seasoned. This has proved a good source of lumber for gates
with mostly splitting involved.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 29 ( Sun. ) Yesterday I hauled 5 loads of
Natchex's manure from the flood plain to the slope garden potato patch and
today dug it in. The kidney beans seem to be doing well after I picked their
bean beetles. So are the sweet potatoes of the slope garden after watering.
They had turned brown from the drought, but respond to watering among the best
of any plants. Rabbit has now taken to eating even pumpkin leaves. We are
drinking mead nearly every day and it has become our favorite. Betty also made
an analogous drink with sugar intended to be soft, but we are letting some
harden. We got a few gallons of water [ in the cistern] from the shower the
other day, but the drought continues unabated. We ate the first Country
Gentleman last night.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 30 The temp. stood at 40deg.F this morning and
today it is very brilliant ( intense blue sky ) and cool, almost cold.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug.31 It was 40deg.F this morning. The other day I
watered the American artichokes and the cantaloupes. This supper we had
butternut squash, the same we had for &quot;pumpkin&quot; pie a while ago. It
is so dry the cowpeas re stunted as they form on the vine. Also, end rot is
very prevalent on tomatoes in the slope garden. I continue to walk Wilbur by
the corn and we have been enjoying it.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Sept.2 It rained last night, quite slowly, but into the
morning and relieved the drought somewhat. It now appears that the stunted
character of my early beans may have been due to the &quot;peanut stunt
virus&quot;, which is apparently quite severe in Virginia this year. Bought
another 100 lb bag of chicken feed.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Sept.6 (Labor Day ) Last night it was 44deg.F at least.

foraging in the rain led by Forager! However, the creek is not too high,,

below the bridge ) <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>This evening ( 9:00 ) it is raining very hard with
thunderstorms. It seems from inspection today that plants<span

still some Japanese beetles. Noted chickens in uproar and went outside to see
an accipiter fly over. It however looked small for a Coopers Hawk.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Oct.2 More rain today. Raccoons got into popcorn
seriously. However I salvaged some, although this was perhaps not quite as hard
and dry as it should<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>be. Since it was
6-15 when planted and has a maturity of 90 days, it should be ready. This
popcorn is also quite severely<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>attacked
by corn earworm. Note8 this corn would not pop when I tried it, but was very
good fried in corn oil. Note* this popcorn was planted too late to dry
properly.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Oct. 3<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Picked
the last of the Country Gentleman today and fed it to the chickens. It is a
long way from hard, showing that such corn must be planted before 6-5 to get
dry corn. Also, it was quite infested with earworm and the raccoons had begun
to get it. Bought 100 lb bag of laying mash. I'm feeding the chickens dogwood
fruits, which are very abundant on the mountain. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Oct.4 Weather is ~70deg,F and cloudy. Turnip, Chinese
radishes, peppers, sweet potatoes, salsify, cabbage and parsnips are all doing
well. I now have excellent mature pumpkins and winter squash, although the

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Oct.7 I have been digging holes ( 7 on top mtn. , 2

<h2>Oct.8 It has been raining again and the walnuts are beginning to drop.</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Oct.9 The stream went over its banks ( 6 inches below
the bridge ), cresting about 9:00 this morning. This is the highest we ever saw
the stream and Betty took a picture. Last night I caught 5 fish, which we had
for breakfast. We also moved Natchez off the flood plain to the barnyard
pasture. Yesterday I saw 2 large snapping turtles, one in the stream and one in
the swamp, which I could have caught.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Oct10 I dug sweet potatoes today. The yield from the

3&quot; long and were pulled out with great force. Yet we see no evidence in
any chicken! Peculiar thins happen in rural America.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

chimney, while inside the stove pipes began to glow in spots. These spots moved
as as burning progressed. At this point I shut all drafts. The hottest spots
seemed to be near the chimney and below the bend just above the stove. much
snapping of expanding metal was also heard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Obviously deposits of carbon were burning inside. Inspection of the
chimney from the roof showed this to be constricted to almost half its area
with thick bubbly leaf-like carbon deposits.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We now resolved to clean the entire system. I cleaned the chimney with a
hoe and a long stick from the roof and removed the material from inside. We
also took off and cleaned all the stove pipes, all of which had substantial
deposits of the same material. We finished our work about 3:30- an unusual
Christmas! As I write the stove is in action again.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

the Country Gentleman corn is more vulnerable to drought than the Golden

ever had, with no bean beetles yet. I also note that the Japaese beetles
cluster so greatly on one or two sweet potatoe leaves or corn cobs tat it is
their undoing! I flick Japanese beetles into a shallow container of water and
the dig a slight depression in the garden soil and burry them. This seems the
easiest technique <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>to me. I also noted
that the Japanese beetles seem very scarce on the hill, particularly on

developed a greatly swollen leg and ankle with a light, evenly-distributed rash

Betty's help, rode Folly today-he being the first to ever do so. Some guts Gus!
Note, the potatoes planted in the last 3 rows are mostly small marble-sized and
wilted, sprouted ones from last year's crop rather than the certified seed
potatoes in the 4 rows planted yesterdays. I also began to spread manure and

belatedly covered them. i plante a 30' band of the same Bloomsdale Longstanding
spinach thaty wited in the slope garden <span

I used lots of horse manure compost above and below the seeds, but covering
only about a half inch. I planted a 30' row of Wando peas in the creek garden

<p class=MsoBodyText>April 29<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Gracie was
bleating and away from the other does, so Betty thought she was about to kid-
after also noticing<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>some discharge and
being hollow<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>by the tail and hip. Gus
got leaves for the new kidding pen. Gracie had her triplets within minutes. She
was in hard labor for only about 30 minutes. Two were born with normal
presentation but the last was upside down and had to be turned and out she
popped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>2 are does and one a buck.
Bought 100 lbs of bran. Planted a 45' band of Royal Chantenay carrots in the
slope garden without fertilizer and under compost. Also, I manured and leveled
in the high field this morning. T. J.F. Shaner brought 12 hives of his bees
this evening after dark. Each hive contains 3 lb of bees. Although it froze
last night, this morning is mild and and cloudy-as if it might rain. The frogs
are singing in the swamp.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>21 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>April 30<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cloudy and
fairly warm today. The bees are quite active. We have been keeping Gracie and
kids in the kidding pen, but today had them out. She appears to have plenty of
milk so far except her small teats make milking difficult. But so far we've
been<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>keeping the kids with her. I planted
12 broccoli plants in the creek garden after placing some goat-chicken manure
mixture in a trench. 11 eggs today. I covered the strawberries tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 1<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It froze<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>slightly late this morning ( after 5 DST ). I
finished spreading and leveling the corn field! Hopefully will begin planting
corn tomorrow. Planted !~30' double row of Crosby's Egyptian beets in the creek
garden using no fertilizer but under manure compost. The little buck of Gracie's
died this evening after much effort to save him by Betty. 19 eggs + a nest of 9
today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 2<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>28deg.F this
morning, but my string beans under canvass<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>didn't freeze. I planted 1/4 of the hill corn field with Longfellow
Flint corn, the same as last year. Gracie is giving lots of milk in addition to
feeding 2 kids. Tonight Betty milked a quart out of one side! Although her
teats appear to be getting larger, one is still too small for milking. 20 eggs
today + 2 from a nest. The parsley is now coming up in the creek garden.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 3<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sold 8 doz.
eggs at 70c a doz. I planted 18 cabbage plants, mostly Jersey Wakefield. They
had good roots with soil and could be planted directly in sunlight. A half
shovel of combined Chicken manure compost and goat manure was used for each
plant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 4<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It rained
quite hard ( warm front type ) most of the day. 16 eggs today. Sold 1.5<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>doz. eggs at 70c a doz. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 5<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Partly cloudy
pleasant day with T~70deg.F-good growing weather finally. I fixed the ice
storm-damaged fence. 19 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 6<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A very bad
worm of size range 1/4 to 3/4 inch, dark olive green ( it may be corn ear worm
) is eating my cabbage plant leaves in the slope garden. This worm appears not
on the plant but on or just under the soil surface, under clods mostly. This
may also be what destroyed<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>some of my
newly-sprouted pea plants. Gus and I planted another patch of field corn. 13
eggs today. Betty quit her job as director of Effie Ann Johnson Day Nursery ,
so now no one in this family is employed of of the farm.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 7 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Planted the
rest of the Longfellow Flint corn- also 1/2 of a patch of<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a 20' x 200' alfalfa ( un known type ). Note
that Gracie's teats are now large enough for milking. 25 eggs today. Bought 100
lbs each of corn and oats.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 8<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It 's been
raining fairly steadily from a warm front. 19 eggs today. The spinach in the
creek garden 4-24 seems to be doing much better than that planted earlier in
the slope garden.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 9<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A warm
(70s),very windy day with a few showers. We dibudded Gracie's kids 9 with
luck!) but are apprehensive since we only held the hot iron on for about 5
seconds. The alfalfa planted 5-7<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>is
already sprouting with roots 1/8 inch long on some. I prepared the rest of the
alfalfa patch. 16 eggs today. The potatoes in both patches are coming up. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 10<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Planted the
rest of the alfalfa patch. No inoculation for nitrogen was done. The seeds were
mixed with soil and spread by hand. Planted a 50' patch (6 rows) of sweet corn,
half Tucker's Favorite hybrid + Golden Cross Bantam in a patch liberally
fertilized with a combination of WR goat and Chicken manure in the slope
garden. 22 eggs today. Gracie showed emission of bloody slime from her vagina,
evidently the remains of birth. The whippoorwill<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>was heard for the first time this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 11 Frost, just barely, in the garden. The thermometer
read 34deg,F near the house. It's good we covered the strawberries, which are
full of blossoms. Finished panting the corn field with Trucker's<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Favorite. 11 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 12 Cleaned stove proper and chimney. The baby goats
have been chewing cuds for the past several days. I leveled and manured for sunflowers
in the hill field. 28 eggs today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It's
raining lightly this evening. I planted a short row of peas in the slope
garden.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 13 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Rain, with
heavy thundershowers at times but warm most of the day. Cabbages<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>planted 4-23, and which were attacked by unknown
creatures and looked really bad, seem improved after this morning's rain. 15
eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 14 Cloudy and windy most of the day. It only warmed up
to about 60deg.F but the bees are very active, particularly in the Chinquapin
oaks, which are now in bloom. All vegetation seems to be growing very rapidly.
21 eggs today. The first alfalfa planted shows primary leaves now.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 15 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Rain and
cloudy weather most of the day. Honey and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Brandy are in a race to kid, with Honey slightly ahead. Gus is sleeping
(watch ?) in the barn over Honey who is in the kidding pen. Gracie's kids are
very husky and growing fast on their continuous milk diet since we have left
them together all the time so far. The only disadvantage is that we only get a
cup or so of her milk a day. 17 eggs today. Honey gave birth within a half hour
to 3 kids, 2 bucks and a doe. ( Chev., Von and Jennifer ) All again are doing
well. But we had to separate her from them during the night because she tried
to pull on the navel cord, presumably to clean the kid.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 16<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Brandy gave
birth to a huge buck (~8 lb ), &quot;Leonardo&quot;. He seems to be very
vigorous and quite nice in a Nubian way. The birth was nearly normal except
that one leg was ahead of the other. The weather continues cloudy and rainy.
Used ( with misgivings!) a 4% malathion powder on 8-10 of the chickens with
severe lice (?) problems ( eaten feathers, exposed raw skin and bare heads ).19
eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 17<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cut the
first lawn hay this morning. It was a mostly cloudy but pleasant day and this evening
turned warmer. I leveled in the high field for beans and peanuts. The field
corn is beginning to come up in earnest now. All the kids are doing fine. 16
eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 18<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Planted in
the hill field 2-100' rows of pinto beans ( second from the edge from Johnny's
Selected Seeds ), 2-100' rows of kidney beans, 1-100' row of Navy beans,
1.66-100' row of Spanish peanuts and 2.33-100' rows of Virginia peanuts ( from
store ). No fertilizer was applied. Planted 2 short rows of<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sundak sunflowers in the slope garden using
no fertilizer, intending to use them for bean support. 22 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 19<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Planted<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>about 300' of Traverse soybeans in the high
field using no fertilizer. Note Nitrogen inoculant was used on the soy beans as
on all beans planted yesterday. However, I don't know exactly what beans are
covered in this inoculant. I also finished manuring and leveling on the hill
field for sunflowers. I hauled in 4.5 WB loads of hay. We disbudded 3 buck
goats Chev., Von and Leonardo.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 20 Planted a 50' x 60' patch of Sundak sunflowers in
the hill field. The two varirties of asparagus beetles are now present in adult
form. I developed a technique of rapidly catching them between my fingers and
crushing them. 17 eggs today. I've been making lots of corn cakes from cornmeal
I grind from sweet corn dried last year and hung in the smokehouse.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 21 The weather is quite warm (80s) during the day. i
applied ashes to the slope garden cabbage which is<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>bothered quite severely by flea beetles-incidentally
mostly near the radishes, an effect opposite to that often quoted by organic
gardeners.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, the horns seem to be
growing on our dibudded bucks! We may have to repeat it! 20 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 22 Bought a pk. of ~100 sweet potato plants + 15 Ca.
Wonder peppers. Sold 8 doz. eggs at 70c a doz. Planted 36 sweet potato plants
in a 45' row of the slope garden, using no fertilizer ( very rich soil however
). 24 eggs today. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Bought 100 lb each of
oats and laying mash.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 23 Cloudy and slightly rainy, improving the garden
visibly as is usual after rain. 18 eggs today. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 24<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Planted a
short and larger row (~45') of Burpee's Stringless bush beans between potatoes,
using innoculant, in the slope garden. Pinto, Navy and soy beans in the hill
field are beginning to come up. Brandy's milk has finally lost its colostrum
taste. The weather is quite warm now (~80s). 23 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 25 It's a beautiful sunny and warm day. I cut some
bluegrass hay near the bees in the slope orchard and got stung once. Betty and
I also took all the dead leaves out of the barn after hearing of a goat kid
that died eating them at a friend's. Planted 1/2 lb of Fordhook lima beans in
the slope garden using inoculant but no fertilizer. 15 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 26<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A hot, clear
day. I finished planting the sweet potatoes and did some spading. 19 eggs
today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 27<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another very
warm but partly cloudy day. A hive of bees swarmed in the early afternoon and
are still hanging on a limb about 20' above the hive. I had notified Shaner,
but he hadn't come at nightfall. I planted 15 Cal Wonder sweet pepper plants in
the creek garden using no fertilizer. We also disbudded Jenny, Honey's doe
today. 15 eggs today. Hauled in 2 WB loads of hay.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 28 J.F.Shaner came early this (Sunday) morning and his
son knocked the bee swarm into a cardboard box after climbing out on a limb.
Mr. Shner then picked the queen out of the grass. We now have an extra hive,
all with supers. We all learned a lot watching this work with bees. Planted all
the Burpee;s VF tomato plants with stakes in the slope garden ( Was fertilized
earlier for corn ).. Also planted an edge row of mung beans<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>along the corn. in the hill field. Betty
caught a good meal of fish for breakfast this evening at sundown. 14 eggs
today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 29 I cut the grass next to the bee hives this morning
weith no apparent disturbance of the bees, but this afternoon I was stung twice
when Betty and I stood at a greater distance! Also, Betty noted some bees in
Gracie's fur. Planted 10 Cayenne pepper plants in the slope garden, a number of
very small Stonehead Hybrid cabbage plants in the creek garden. I also watered
the spinach in the creek garden. 16 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 30 I hoed potatoes and corn in the high field. We
picked our first strawberries 9 tame and wild ) and had spinach for supper.
It's interesting that the captured swarm is already in need of another super,
the one super having filled since the swarm was captured Sunday morning
according to Shaner. 13 eggs today. The weather is warm and muggy with a few
drops of rain this afternoon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>May 31 The field corn is now 6 inches high and I have been
hoing it. Planted 8 hills of Ambrosia<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Hybrid cantaloupe + 4 hills of Sugar Baby watermelon in the slope garden
over holes in which about 3 shovels o WR goat manure was p[laced. The bees at
present are very active<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>on the blue
flowers of the weed ground ivy ( <i>Glechoma hederacea </i>) present in both
gardens. I also noted that this year there are no f lea beetles present in the
creek garden, due perhaps to the freezing this year. 14 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 1<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Planted a
30' row of kidney beans in the creek garden using innoculant. I finished hoeing
the field corn and noted that on the southern exposure it didn't come up well.
I cut hay on the flood plain. .Planted ~!25' row of Burpee's Stringless beans in
the slope garden using inoculant. Betty noticed clouds of dirt looking very
much like smoke <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>coming from 2 of the bee
hives this morning. She has been working with Folly, who had the bit on for the
first time. Watered spinach, peas etc. in the slope garden. 12 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 2<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Brandy has
what appear to be the same skin eruptions she had last December. We bathed her
with warm salt water and kept her out of the dirty old stall. Fortunately it is
still mild. Planted 3 hills of Gurney's Marketer cucumber and2 hills of
Wisconsin SMR Pickler in the creek den after placing 2 shovels of chicken-goat
compost under each hill. The weather continues quite warm (80s ) and dry.
Hauled in equivalent to 2 WB of bluegrass hay. Disbudded 7 goats for Becky
Ganson. Planted a number of Roma VF tomatoes in the slope garden. 10 eggs
today. Note, we increased the chicken's rations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 3 Rain beginning in early afternoon-very good for
hill field crops, but not for the hay cut the other day. Becky Ganson and son
were here to tattoo and castrate<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>our
kids. The numbers and names are as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>MRE-2 in Right Ear of all</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Left Ear: M1<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Feather</p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Leonardo</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Chev and Von were castrated using the band.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The rain stopped this evening after a good soaking. Only 8
eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 4<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had 7
nice fish Betty caught<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>last evening for
breakfast. It's a beautiful clear day. Planted<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Sunray and VF small tomato plants in the creek garden. Betty and I
covered the strawberries and sweet potatoes since frost seems to threaten. 7
eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 5<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It didn't
freeze last night. Planted some chervil and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>t-? Hauled in 3.5 WB of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>bedding-hay. I spaded the creek garden for a corn patch. 13 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 6 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Hauled 6 WB
loads of hay in. After placing liberal chicken-goat manure compost I planted
3-25' rows of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Golden Cross Bantam and
3-25' rows of Trucker's Favorite in the creek garden. Brandy developed mastitis
in the left half of her bag this afternoon as indicated by fever and milk
curdling at milking time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She appeared
listless. We're treating her after much good advice from Charles Varner Jr. by
combination injection, bathing with hot water and frequent milkings. She and
her kid were separated from the herd in the kidding pen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 7 Brandy appeared somewhat better<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>last night during the night as we got up to
milk and bath her and continued to improve. This morning, with her eating some,
she shows no sign ( since the first few milkings) of curdling milk. We give her
~3ccof combiotic twice a day in the muscle. Inspection of the hill field shows
the potatoes dark green and fair to good in size. The alfalfa is about
2-3&quot; high and shows numerous nodules on the roots, although no inoculant
was used. The wheat, however, shows blotchy yellow lower leaves. The soy beans
and corn look good. We separated Gracie from her kids and got about a quart + a
little more of milk. Brandy continues to<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>be with her kid though separated from the other goats. 7 eggs today.
Planted one hill of Prolific Straightneck squash, 2 hills of Butternut squash
and one hill of Small Sugar pumpkin in the creek garden after placing one
shovel of chicken-goat compost in each hill.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 8 Light rain. Planted 2-30' rows of Red Kidney beans

are having the Waldners as guests and tomorrow grandma. Hope it doesn't freeze
tonight!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 10<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hauled in 4
WB of hay with help of guests. 11 eggs today. Ate a lot ofspinach and
strawberries with our guests.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 11 The Arnold family, Grandma and the Waldner family
left this morning. Brandy got her last cambiotic shot yesterday morning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>11 eggs today. I watered small plants in the
creek garden and potatoes, cabbage, carrots etc. in the slope garden. Betty
picked about 5 qts. of strawberries, three of which we froze for jam. The peas
are in full bloom with a few small peas. Also<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>the potatoes are blooming.. I killed a few potato beetles in the slope
garden. The peanuts are coming up slowly-for the past few weeks. But very few
large peanuts have come up yet. The alfalfa looks good, being about 3 inches
high now in places. I cut another patch of hay on the flood plain. [Betty
writes:] Our guests left this morning. By putting the boys in the hay loft we
had 10 people; the Waldners and Grandma plus Ter? and Janet ( Arnolds ) and
Lawrence, Bob W.2nd cousins twice removed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 12 Planted 5 hills of small Sugar pumpkin after
placing one shovel of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>chicken-goat
compost. The store-bought peanuts planted in the hill field didn't germinate (
except for a few ). I planted soy beans where the peanuts were. The wheat is
beginning to head out. Corn, beans (soy = others ), potatoes and alfalfas all
look good and need only rain on the hill field. Planted a 20' row of inoculated
Imp. Golden wax beans in the slope garden. Rain, a heavy shower-for only 15
min. this evening. 10 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 13 Rain, heavy for about 1/2 hr. last night. 14 eggs
today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 14 Hauled in 5.5 Wb loads of hay ( rained on once )
to mow. 18 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 15<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Transplanted leeks to trench, leaving half where they were. The trench
had earlier had a WB of manure placed in it. 12 eggs today. The night before
last it was 38deg.F and last night 40deg.F.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 16 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Replanted
some cantaloupe hills in the slope garden with Honey Rock cataloupe. I also
watered the strawberries, which are still bearing well. Transplanted VF tomato
plants to the creek garden using not fertilizer as usual.. 19 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 17 Hauled in 3.5 loads of hay from the flood plain to
mow. Started using Brandy's milk again/ The weather is hot and sultry. 12 eggs
today. We're getting a few small eggs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 18 Another very hot sultry day, but dry. Most crops
in the hill field look quite good, but rain is badly needed. I watered
extensively in the slope garden, especially cabbage. We separated Brandy and
kid for the first time + Gracie and kids for more milk tomorrow. 26 eggs today.
Apparently the extra feed increased laying.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 19 Rain, heavy thunderstorms in late afternoon. sold
6 doz. eggs at 70c a doz.. 17 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 20 Froze 4 qts. edible podded peas. Also still
picking strawberries and have frozen 6 qts. so far for jam etc. Very hot and
humid, partly cloudy ggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 21 Rain, intermittent light thundershowers most of
the day. All crops are growing so fast some are falling over. ( potatoes
especially ). Pinto and kidney beans, potatoes and wheat are blooming in the
hill field. We kept Honey's kids from her last night (except for Jenny ) and in
all got over a gallon of milk from her this morning. Brandy's and Gracie's kids
are being separated every night now. All kids seem to be doing well, including
the weathers whose testicles have now shrunk very small. However, Leonardo is mounting
the does, giving us some concern. 22 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 22 Cut hay on flood plain and pulled weeds in hill
field where crops are doing fine 26 eggs today. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 23 Boys and I began hoeing the field corn. i weeded
alfalfa, beans, potatoes etc. up there. Froze 5 qts. of edible podded peas and
a qt. of strawberries. We dined on delux hamburger, the best spinach I ever
grew and ice cream made with our milk, eggs and strawberries.+ sassafras tea.
16 eggs today. Betty rode Folly today forthe first time with Dad leading her.
Betty has sat upon her so she is coming along fine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 24<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I went to a
Taxpayer's rally in Deerfield. Betty and the boys hauled in ? loads of hay
today.. 24 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 25 Planted 2 rows of pinto beans in the creek garden
using innoculant. 18 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 26 Very warm, humid weather. The boys continue to hoe
corn and the soy beans are beginning to bloom. Also black caps are ripening.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 27 Rain with heavy thunderstorms last evening and
into the night. Another swarm of bees spotted by me on the ground in front of
the hive. Young Shaner came, found the queen, held her in hand until the swarm
gathered, then shook them into a hive, which he left on the spot. Betty and I
watched from close by and she took pictures. Everything looks good in the hill
field, but especially the beans, which are beginning to form pods in the case
of pinto, kidney and navy. The weather is very hot and humid. ipicked
(repeatedly) the cabbage worms in the slope garden. 16 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 28 It was a warm clear day and I cut hay on the flood
plain. Froze 3qts. of podded peas and picked a quart of blackcaps. Gus is also
picking this year. 19 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 29 Froze 3 pints of Wando peas and hoed soy beanson
the hill. 21 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>June 30 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Continued
quite warm but somewhat dryer. Hauled in 4 WB of hay from the flood plain and 2
WB of bedding hay. 19 eggs today. The pinto beans on the hill have a few
3&quot; pods! All hill beans, corn and alfalfa look excellent, potatoes fair,
wheat? The peanuts that germinated are doing OK since I hoed them. The
sunflowers that came up look very good but are few in number.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 1 Warm, pleasant weather. I rode Candy and Betty
Natchez around the hill twice, the most I had ever ridden. I hoed the mung
beans on the hill and also weeded the potatoes there. The corn is now about
4.5<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>feet tall in most places. 21 eggs
today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 2 Rain, beginning last night and continuing
intermittently through the day and into the night. Betty and I picked
blackcaps. The strawberries are quite finished now. 20 eggs today. There is an
incredible infestation of cabbage worms in the slope garden, but much less in
the creek garden. I squash many several times a day, but they have riddled many
leaves on the fine large plants now forming heads.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 3<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rain, off
and on all day. I picked about<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>2 qts. of
blackcaps and froze one of these. 20 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 4<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cloudy and
humid. I noticed patches of orange dodder in the alfalfa-peraps due to all the
moisture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Froze 3 pints of Wando peas.
17 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 5<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A clear,
cool day. I cut hay on the flood plain and picked cabbage worms as usual. I
also picked<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>2 qts. of blackcaps and
froze one of these. 20 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 6<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another
nice, rather cool and sunny day. I hoed the numerous weeds in the creek garden.
We went to the Shipe special use permit hearing and at least dot it ( the body
shop ) restricted tmo a one-man operation. We had about 15 eggs today. Bought
100 lb each of whole corn and laying mash.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 7<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another dry,
clear day. We hauled in 5 WB of hay from the flood plain. Froze 2 qts of
berries. Betty is treating Natchez for a bad facial wound she has had for some
time. 21 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 8<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hot, muggy
and partly cloudy day. Planted a 30' row of Burpee's<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stringless bush beans in the creek garden
using inoculant. We had a thunder shower. We also have lots of dewberries this
year and I froze a qt. today. We also gought 100 lb of oats.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 9 All of us except Don went up the hill and picked
almost 2 gallons of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>dewberries. We froze
7 pints of these. I cut the strawberry leaves with the scythe and pulled a lot
of old plants. 14 eggs today. We had French toast and berries using our own
eggs, berries and milk, a real feast! Young Shaner came and placed some supers,
particularly on one active hive where the bees had clustered at the entrance.
He found all hives in good shape.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 10 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Rain as
thunderstorms again this evening. I finished thinning the berries and placed a
WB of rich chicken-goat compost on their bed. Don and I repaired the line
fence. 20 eggs today. I froze another 3 pts. of ( mostly ) dewberries.and
blackcaps. Japanese beetles are now appearing in the creek and slope gardens.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 11 A clear, cool day. I cut hay on the flood plain.16
eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 12<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sold 8 doz
eggs at 70c a doz. 17 eggs today. I repaired the barn roof, which has been
leaking. Betty and I went berry picking, mostly dewberries, but some blackcaps
and a very few blueberries. We froze 2 qts and Betty baked a pie.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 13 Hauled in 5.5 WB full of good hay from the flood
plain. This hay contained a quite a bit of red and white clovers. Planted a 32'
row of half Marketer cucumber and 1/2<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Green Curled endive in the slop garden where podded peas had been after
placing a WB of rich chicken-goat compost in a trench.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rain this evening and 16eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 14 Rain as a thundershower this morning. Don and I
worked at a log jam in the stream. I picked berries, mostly dewberries, some
blackcaps and blueberries. I froze 2 qts. I dug the first potatoes and feasted
on them this evening. 16 eggs today. Sold 3 doz. eggs at 70c a doz.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 15 Betty<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>has
been treating Natchez<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>for a bad face
wound. We're also confining Leonardo and Brandy to the flood plain for part of
the day to get them used to separation from the other goats. Don and I did some
fencing and Don cut his first firewood with a bucksaw. I cut hay for mulch for
the melons. 21 eggs today. However this included some from a large nest of<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>uncollected eggs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 16<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It rained
very hard last night, was cloudy most of the day and is raining again. I weeded
in the slope garden as pulling weeds after a rain is easy. I aslso harvested a
bunch of half-grown carrots. The corn in the slope garden and on the hill is
silking out now. The soy beans look spectacular and all the dry beans look very
good. The sunflowers are also doing nicely. 17 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 17 Planted a short band of Danvers Half Long carrots
where the radishes had benn in the slope garden. It's a bright, warm day.
Planted a 35' row of Burpee Stringless beans next to the carrots in the slope garden
and where the peas were. I noted that bean beetles are bothering<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the kidney beans some in the creek garden,
although not at all on the hill. Don rode Candy around Mueller's Mtn. for the
first time. Natchez and Betty went too. He did quite well and walked and
trotted. 17 eggs today. The raccoons showed signs of activity in the hill field
and we set up the tent for our irst night on raccoon watch.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 18<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Betty found
that she has a teaching position at the school for the Blind and starts on
August 28th. Gus and Bob are sleeping on the hill to scare raccoons off, Bob is
giving a talk in Rockingham County so Gus took Wilbur. Don and Betty weent
riding on Candy and Natchez. Betty rode Folly this morning. 18 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 19 Brandy has mastitis again, appearing ill, not
letting milk down and stripping evidence. This morning Betty applied hot packs
at milking and we are starting Combiotic shots. Picked dewberries and froze a
quart. Made a ~8 lb batch of sour kraut. Brandy is eating and perhaps a little
better after the shot this morning. 17 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 20 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Hauled in 4
WB loads of good<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>( mostly red clover )
hay from the flood plain. I made another 8 lb batch of sour kraut. 14 eggs
today. Bought 100 lb of oats.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 21 Brandy appears to have a slight relapse this
morning, but she is eating, especially brush. I picked beetle larvae on the
kidney beans in the creek garden where they are moderately bad on large
vigorous bushes, I also noted some on the lima beans in the slope garden. About
10;00 AM a huge swarm of bees<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>arrived at
one of our largest oaks, about 40' up originally. Shaner attempted for more
than an hour with our help to get them in a hive but left without finding the
queen. They then reformed into a clump lower in the same oak. Now we're having
thunderstorms. Shaner came again and luckily found the queen and hived them
with a little help from us. He plans on supering our other hives, which are
full on his check. The weather is very warm (~90s ). 14 eggs today, including a
found nest of four. Betty and I walked around the hill twice this morning after
spotting the bees.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 22 Very hot weather, but we had a meal of green beans
and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>pork cooked on the plate. I cut and
mulched the melons with swamp hay. I'm also building a buck fence for Leonardo.
Brandy seems some better and has been eating well. The dry beans are turning
yellow on the hill and bearing what appears to be a quite good crop. Also, the
sweet corn at least looks good. The sunflowers are heading out and the soy
beans are very dark green, lush and have a good number of still small beans.
The oldest plants are mid-thigh in height. However, the alfalfa appears yellow
and stunted and the peanuts are not doing well with yellow leaves also. These
two legumes were not inoculated and this may explain their failure. 14 eggs
today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 23 The weather is very warm and it is becoming dry,
especially on the hill field. I have been watering in both gardens, but only a
little in the creek garden. 9 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 24 Light rain from thundershowers this evening. Had a
feast opf new potatoes, cabbage and cucumber salad and &quot;fancy
hamburgers&quot; with hot sauce[?] and lemonade. i worked at digging fence post
holes, placing posts for Leonardo's pen and hooking up the new post for the
barn light wires. I also picked bean beetles on the kidney beans in the creek
garden. 11 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 25 Light rain off and on. Gus and I dug<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>somewhat over a bushel<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>( half the patch ) of potatoes on the hill. I
continued to pick bean beetle larvae ( crushing them ) on the kidney beans in
the creek garden. I also picked blister beetles, ( crushing them with my foot )
that had decimated the beet tops in the creek garden. 11 eggs today. Note that
bees are lively on coral berry bushes, apparently getting nectar<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and on the field corn getting pollen this
morning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We stopped giving Brandy shots
as she seemed well now.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Betty made 13 and
a fraction pints of dewberry and blackberry jam.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 26 Betty and I picked dewberries and blackberries and
froze 3 pints. We froze 5 quarts of green beans. Only 6 eggs today. Is it the
heat? Shaner was unsuccessful in an attempt to<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>move a bee hive after dark since he failed to block the entrance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 27 Sold 3 doz. eggs at 70c a doz. 10 eggs today. Some
raccoon damage is occurring in the hill field despite Gus and I sleeping up
there in the tent-even wth Wilbur with us!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 28<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After light
rain last night another clear, dry day (~70s). We processed and canned 7 qts.
of sour kraut. 8 eggs today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Gus and I
also dug the second half of the potato patch on the hill.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jly 29 Another nice day. Don and I<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>hauled<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>down about a bushel and a half of potatoes from the hill field so that
we got approximately 3 bushels there. Only 4 eggs today. We increased the feed
of the chickens again. Bean beetles are bad on the kidney beans in the creek
garden. I am watering quite extensively in the slope garden.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 30 Noted a large hairy caterpillar has almost
completely<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>defoliated one of the 3 yr.
Yellow Delicious<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>apple trees in the north
slope orchard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are rain
showers<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>for the first time in weeks- and
badly needed. 5 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>July 31<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Used
malathion dust on the J.J.Warrens again for external parasites.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Betty and I picked and froze 2 qts. of
berries ( mostly black ) and I froze 4 qts. of green beans. 8 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Aug. 1 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Rain from
heavy thunderstorms last night-for the second night in a row, and I was in the
tent. But the raccoons had already gotten into the hill sweet corn before dark!
However they didn't get in more while I was there-I think. Shaner ( and friends
) came and moved the bees to our bee yard from the flood plain where they had
been a week or more. Now we anticipate trouble with them returning. Already
this morning some have returned. Some trouble from bees this morning but their
numbers at the former hive position diminished in the afternoon, particularly
after heavy rain. Shaner ( senior ) came to look at the situation this evening.
5 eggs today. Bought<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>100 lbs each of
corn and oats.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Aug. 2 Betty pickled 8.5 qts. of pickles. I made a gallon
batch of sour kraut. I also harvested about a peck of yellow onions. We had a
feast of our first sweet corn Trucker's Favorite from the hill field, and it
was excellent. 6 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Aug. 3 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Froze 4 qts.
of Trucker's Favorite sweet corn from the hill field. Pulled up and brought to
barn to dry 2 feed bags of pinto beans from the hill field. These<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>were quite dry already. Made another gallon
of sour kraut. I began to dig potatoes in the slope garden where many are
damaged by a fat, dark grub-although many fat white grubs are present also.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Augl. 4 Rain, quite heavy at times today. Since I didn't
sleep out raccoons really got into the hill sweet corn.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hauled up<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>about a bu. of potatoes from the slope garden. I spread chicken manure
from the coop litter on the goat pasture. 7 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Aug. 5<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Froze 4 qts.
of sweet corn from the slope garden after raccoons got in for first time. The
Trucker's Favorite is the best looking I<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>ever grew.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Made another gallon of
sour kraut to eat raw.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rain showers from
beautiful cumulus clouds on and off all afternoon, alternating with brilliant
sky, but humid. 7 eggs today. We dined this evening ( Gus and I, Don and Betty
having gone to Massachusetts on the 3rd ) on raccoon damaged sweet corn from
the high field.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Aug. 6 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Rain
continued as usual in a heavy downpour<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>this evening, after a generally cloudy day. The raccoons din't bother
any of the corn last night, although only the hill field was guarded. However,
this evening it rained too hard to go and I expect trouble. 9 eggs today.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We're also having plenty of trouble with our
nearest neighbor, who we opposed in a special use permit for a painting and
body shop. This evening he made all sorts of dire threats re that we had better
move because we<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>could expect nothing but
trouble from now on and that &quot;we are not wanted&quot; in the community.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Aug. 7 Another warm humid, cloudy day with rain
threatening this morning. I pulled up the rest of the pinto beans and all the
navy beans on the hill field.- about a<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>bag and a half.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These had a touch
of rot and mold where they contacted the ground. I also pulled 2 bags of kidney
beans from the hill field.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I dug the last
of the potatoes in the slope garden-they look good. 8 eggs today I placed Virginia
pine posts along the B's<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>line fence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Aug. 8 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A warm, very
humid day, but no rain for a change. Betty and Don returned from
Massachusetts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I finished bringing in
the potato harvest, about 5 bushels in all. I also brought down raccoon
damaged<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>corn from the hill for the
goats. 7 eggs today.</p>

pinto beans. Don and I dug 3 more post holes on Bellanger's line fence.. 11

5 more lbs of pinto beans. from the hill, making a total of about 16 lbs. We
had a short heavy<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>thunderstorm this
afternoon. 12 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Aug. 12 It rained a little last night while I slept in the
tent. Betty and I canned 8 qts. of sour kraut this morning, using the wood
stove as usual since it was fairly cool. I harvested the garlic, which I had
laying in the garden and the shallots , which I also had laying in the garden.
14 eggs today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Aug. 13 <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Patched
