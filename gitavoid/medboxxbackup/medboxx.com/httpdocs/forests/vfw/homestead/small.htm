<h1>Homestead<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></h1>

<p class=Byline>by R.F.Mueller</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>In a sense Homestead is an archetype of the &quot;back
to the land&quot; movement that rests on the basics but drags some urban
amenities along, making use of supplementary oil heat, refrigeration and
electricity in general. However, with few exceptions, mechanical power expended
is largely human and animal, with machines playing only a supplementary role.
Typically, common spading takes the place of mechanical tillers and hand
crosscut saws that of chain saws. It relates the basics of supplying shelter,
water and food and in coping with adversity. It illustrates the importance of
timing in working with nature. Thus raising vegetables<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>can be followed from initial soil preparation
and seeding to harvest and crop disposal and storage. Tenets employed are
predominantly organic, avoiding industrial chemicals in coping with pests and
problems generally. I hope errors and disasters are included as faithfully as
triumphs. From the start our efforts were favored not a little by rich
limestone-based soils, a gentle climate and our lack of indebtedness on our
land and possessions. Our dwelling and most of the land of this tract is
located on a southeast slope, which enables an early start to our growing
season. Additionally our yard is characterized by a magnificent stand of mature
Chinquapin Oaks (<i> Quercus muhlenbergii </i>), which, with a large Norway
Maple ( <i>Acer platanoides </i>), provide us with summer cooling and countless
other amenities. Also, not a little of the natural assets of the place is owed
to the presence of the strong, year-round-flowing Folly Mills Stream.
Although<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the natural beauty of the place
owes a lot to the hilly character of the land, this also severely limits the
arable land available. It also helped a lot that both Betty and I came from
rural backgrounds, as well as having advanced degrees, in my case in geology. Additionally,
Betty had considerable practical knowledge of animals. To be found here in
particular, is a rich detail of goat breeding and handling for milk and meat
production, bee keeping and horse care and handling. So mostly we knew what to
expect from most enterprises launched. Part of the impetus for passing along
these experiences is the likelihood that the simple, low energy life style and
skills they embody will assume a far greater importance in the future. Perhaps
an extreme version of this life style is hinted at in the useful, if limited,
foraging represented by fishing and the dandelion and cress salads mentioned. Additionally
the accurate timing should give our observations considerable phenological value.

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><u>Homestead, which consists of about 29 acres of hilly
land and a small swamp, is located in Augusta County,Virginia, in the heart of
the Shenandoah Valley. at<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>latitude 38 15
North. and near 1500 ft. ( 457 meters ) in elevation. Bedrock is Paleozoic in
age, and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>predominantly<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>magnesium-rich limestone in composition, Our
house, which has a rude earth floored basement, has 700 sq, feet of living
space and indoor plumbing. There also is an oil furnce in the basement. Suffice
to say the building is drafty, and leaks were common until we put on a new
metal roof. Note also that a &quot;species&quot; of livestock feed I call
&quot;alfacorn&quot; is according to my dear wife Betty ( who shared all these
experiences ), not really a valid one. and represents some type of feed not
identified. Also, it will be noted that spelling leaves something to be
desired.<o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Prelude immediately before April 19, 1975 entry: <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Purchased this farm in Spring 1975 from Ernest R. Rowe,
with closing on March 19.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>April 19,1975 <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Came to farm and took over from Mr. Rowe. Also
planted two grape vines, a Concord and a Caco [ ? ]<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Later planted a garden consisting of onions, parsnips,
radishes, lettuce, carrots, beans, cucumbers, watermelons, tomatoes, collards.
Betty and I picked a quite a few blackberries in July and she made jam. The
children and all of us did a good deal of fishing on all of our visits,
catching what appeared to be large chubs and one sucker.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug 8-11 On this trip highlights were Betty baking
blackberry cobbler, finding several peach trees and an excellent garden
location above the flood plain just below the hill [ called &quot;slope
garden&quot; by us ]. We also located a heavily laden Crab apple tree. We
estimate the peaches will be ripe in about 3 weeks to a month and perhaps 2
weeks for the crabapple. I harvested one large cucumber and the watermelon has
several tiny ones on. Also the carrots, parsnips an tomatoes are doing well. I
pulled the last of the onions. We also visited Mr. Heizer, one of our bordering
neighbors who told us about the new garden location. Last night we heard
Screech Owls- the first I had heard in many years.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 24 ( Sun.) We arrived here yesterday afternoon
from Lanham. Since then we have been enjoying the place again. Today I gathered
cattail bulbs, roots etc. and about a half a peck of crabapples which Betty
intends to use for sauces. pies etc. I also purchased a four tined hoe for
gathering the cattails but found my hands seemed to work best. So far the
&quot;cattail flour&quot; experiment seems to be a failure. The crabapples seem
to be the native American variety, and there seems to be about several bushels
on the tree. This morning Betty caught six small chus for breakfast. and
tonight we intend to eat the cattails. I also found my garden doing quite well
and harvested 3 large cucumbers. It is raining as I write this and water is
running in the cistern.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug 27 We have been enjoying the place. Yesterday we
had a second meal of cattails. Betty and I are real enthusiasts. I gathered
them for the first time barefoot. We manage to like even what Gus calls
&quot;dim[?]tail&quot; the starchy enlargement at the base of the stem. I am
also drying crabapples and we're all gobbling peaches, which are just beginning
to ripen. This morning we had four nice fish for breakfast. ( yesterday we had
a dozen or so ), one being a 9.25 inch sucker, golden in color. I am making a
&quot;compost' pile or rather &quot;windrow&quot; along the newly discovered
hill base garden spot. I tossed dark ( organic rich ) thick sods from the edge
of the floodplain to the garden edge. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>{ This is followed by a diagram of the flood plain,
slope garden and hill [ &quot;Mueller's Mountain&quot; ] from the stream to the
hill top. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Presumably these clods contain nutrients, including N
in the plant material. Hopefully these will be stored for use next spring in
the garden. This resembles practices of the Chinese. As i write this Betty is
going to a meeting with Mi Clarkson, a horse breeder. The children are enjoying
their tree home and rope. Yesterday I bought a wheelbarrow for $50.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug. 29 Scored one! Betty caught ten small fish.
Weather continues nice. I am drying more crabapples. Yesterday Betty and I
prepared holes on the Mtn. for 2 apple andf one pair tree. Last night we had a
great meal of sweet corn ( from Heizers ), hamburger, fresh biscuits and
crabapple cobbler. I'm also repairing chinks in the basement door.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Aug 31I caught a severe head cold last night and a m
lying around sick and feverish today. Yesterday evening we feasted on cattails
again. Now this evening I spent some time getting acquainted<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>with the plumbing and this afternoon took a
walk up the hill ( despite my cold ) and discovered a wild pear tree on top.
This tree's loaded with small pears the size of crabapples ( ~2&quot; ).
yesterday I also cut some more poles and noted that a 17 yr. old mockernut grew
2' 4&quot; this year although may be unusual because of all the rain. The
weather continues hot and dry.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Sept 1Tomorrow early we return to Lanham after a great
10 days. It rained quite heavily last night but it is fine cool weather<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>now.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Betty is fishing again as I write this. We have been picking peaches
from a tree and apples from the hill behind Shipes.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Sept. 28 ( Sun. ) We came here evening of the 26 th and
return this evening. The weather has been beautiful after heavy rains. We have
been picking apples, walnuts and a few wild pears. Betty caught some nice fish,
one 9&quot; or- {?} and last night we had cattails. We also had an outdoor fire
last night and this evening. I also harvested some excellent cucumbers and
tomatoes. I also assembled my prefab sawbuck. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>[ which amazed Betty ! ]<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Oct. 11We arrived yesterday evening after putting our
Lanham house up for sale. The morning dawned beautifully after heavy rain last
evening. Betty caught a number of fish, the largest being 2 10&quot; suckers
that retained spawn. The day was beautiful and we went to Staunton to shop for
material to caulk the house. I collected walnuts and apples. This evening we
again built a fire. We also collected the watermelon , which was good but not
completely ripe. The tomatoes had been frozen some time ago as were the
cucumbers, but the carrots and parsnips were in good shape. I went home early
but Betty and the boys stayed the week. This trip Betty caught a 12 and
1/4&quot; sucker, also an 11 incher.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Oct. 25-28 Although fishing has been poor. we have been
making finds such as nut trees, in particular hickory nuts. Today( 28 ) we
found a mockernut loaded with particularly large nuts. Yesterday Betty made
cookies with hickory and walnuts. We had a lovely fire last night and I did a
lot of talking. I also continue to collect and process walnuts. We enjoyed a
meal of the first parsnips. Saw a flock of Bluebirds on the Mountain.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Nov. 7-10 The weather is very unusual.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today ( Nov. 8 ) it was bright and sunny,
with temp. in the 70s. I finally fixed the back porch storm door, installing
the plexiglass with my own &quot;stick&quot; holders. I also planted a 10 ft.
double row of Jerusalem artichokes, picked more walnuts an hickory nuts as well
as a store of bittersweet. Gus and I are here alone ( with Wilbur [our Labrador
Retriever ] , while Betty remains with Don in Lanham. Last night she called and
said we had our first &quot;contract&quot; offer on the house. I also saw my
first squirrel live here- a red.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Nov, 26-30 ( 27th and Thanksgiving day ) and today we
all planted the first trees, which Shipes had heeled in the garden for us.
These trees, obtained from Stark Bros., consisted of two Montmorency cherries,
one Dutches Pear, one Golden Delicious apple. We planted the cherries near the
house and the rest on the north slope of Mueller's Mtn. Yesterday also, Bobby
Shipe shot a deer.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Dec. 12-14 ( Dec. 14 ) Don, Gus and I are spending a
short weekend here. On the way down we had to replace a generator brush in the
VW, Fortunately, we found the &quot;Metric&quot; VW garage at Luray. Yesterday
I also bought a 1959 Chev<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>1/2 ton truck
from Mr. Taylor, a neighbor down the branch. We also cut a small Virginia pine
for a Christmas tree and put up some flashing lights in the window.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Dec. 24-Jan. 4 Good Christmas here today (26 Dec,)
Betty caught 11 fish including a 13and 3/4 inch sucker ! Last night we had
sleet and power went off for a few hours. Sunday 28 I will return to Lanham.
Spaded<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>( Jan. 2 ) 30' x 12' garden plot
at base of hill. Still good fishing.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<h2>Jan.16 1976 Here for weekend; mostly frozen solid.</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Jan. 22-25 Quite cold and frozen. Noted ( on 23 ) that
hearwood of black walnut is far more resistant to insect attack and decay (
particularly the latter ) than the sapwood so that old logs with the sapwood
almost entirely gone are still usable and in fact very sound and attractive
with their beautiful grain. I have been making simple &quot;artifacts&quot; from
this walnut, fish cleaning boards, stools etc. Today also the afternoon was
bright and sunny with T= 43 deg, F and more in the sun. We are as usual
enjoying ourselves and nature here.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Feb. 8 The boys and I spent weekend here, mostly to
check up on the place. Weather moderately cold but sunny ( 14 deg. Feb.7 ).
Mostly tried to build a bench, gathered more walnut.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Feb. 15-17 Left Lanham Friday 13 morning and have been
busy here ever since. I spaded more garden so that I now have a 12'x 60' patch
on the slope above the flood plain. Yesterday Betty baked a chocolate cake for
Gus' birthday ( which is today, <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>16th ) and we gave him my old hand axe for a present. I
had had had it for about 35 years although I recently made a new handle and
case. Today I cut brush around the wild crabapple tree. I have also been making
objects such as White oak mauls, walnut stools etc. The weather is so warm the
boys are splashing in the stream as I write this. Gus is in his bathing suit. I
also collected some excellent parsnip yesterday. Tomorrow morning we return to
Lanham.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Feb. 26-30 It is 60 deg. as I write this on the 27th (
much warmer in the sun ) ( It was 32 deg. this morning ) and the peach buds are
starting to open. I have been spading the side hill garden again and now
have<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a 12'x70' patch. I also place 2
wheelbarrow loads of manure ( well rotted ) ( cow ?) and full of red worms around
the peach tree. I have been cooking outside ( i am here alone ) on the new
30&quot; x 30&quot; x 1/4 &quot; steel plate I bought from Augusta Steel. This
appears to work very well, not smoking the pans and allowing a variety of
heats. The weather is quite dry and I haven't even tried to go fishing so far.
I have also been cutting poles and have as yet noticed no sap rising in the
oaks.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Feb. 28 Today I finished preparing 3-70' rows, with 2
WB of WR manure / row for potatoes. (T) I also planted a 40' row of<span

This is another warm dry day, bad for fruiting buds. Also Bobby Shipe<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and Gary [Lape ] caught a large number of
very large suckers (~15&quot; and some 18&quot; ! ) as well as some small trout
at Bobby's fishing hole [ just across the road ]<o:p></o:p></b></p>

sassafras tea and eating dandelion salads. Betty has been working on leather
covers for the old couch cushions, The boys have been enjoying the stream as
usual, having gone swimming on Friday. Wilbur is<span

spade. I also spaded a 10' x 7' asparagus bed in what may be virgin soil. It is
on the slope near the Jerusalem artichoke bed, very dark deep friable and full
of worms. I also put up a grape arbor for the two vines planted last spring.
