Virginians for Wilderness salute the life and work of Ernie who did more to further the cause of wilderness in the eastern U.S. than any other person.  His spirit will always be with us in the mountains as we strive to continue his work.

<h3>A Wilderness for Ernie</h3>
In 1986 Virginians for Wilderness proposed a 65000 acre Shenandoah Wilderness for the George Washington National Forest. Although this wilderness was never designated, it received considerable publicity in the media and was supported by the Wilderness Society. We now suggest that this proposed wilderness be renamed the Ernie Dickerman Wilderness.
<p>
This would be the largest national forest wilderness east of the Mississippi. It would also have many features of outstanding ecological significance, such as old-growth forest and many rare and disjunct species ( Wild Earth 1, (3), 1991 ). It would provide remote habitat and solitude that is rare in the East. The location is near Ernie's home place where he died and one of the few places where such a large wilderness could be created. During late years Ernie worked hard to preserve large parts of it.
<p>
Ernie was a charter member of the Wilderness Society, and several of the Society's founders, namely Bob Marshall and Aldo Leopold, have had large western wilderness areas named after them. Ernie deserves no less to commemorate his achievements. We ask everyone to support the Ernie Dickerman Wilderness.<p>

<h3>URGENT NOTICE (May 6th, 2010)</h3>
Please  urge authorities to use agricultural  products  (dry  hay, straw, corn stalks etc. as well  as brush to hold in  place)   at edges of sensitive areas such as the Mississippi  Delta.  Deposition could be  from the air or otherwise. This material is abundant, cheap and readily available. This  would rapidly take up and nueutralize the toxic components, might be left in place or removed at convenience.
