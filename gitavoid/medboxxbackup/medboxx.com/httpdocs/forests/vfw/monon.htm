 The Monongahela
 National Forest lies in the strategic heart of the Appalachians.
 Including parts of the Valley and Ridge Province and the Allegheny
 Mountains and Plateau, it is the most promising bastion for
 wilderness recovery and big wilderness in the entire Central
 Appalachian region. Its 900,000 acres of federal lands could be
 doubled through acquisition of wildlands within and adjacent to the
 proclamation boundary. It has excellent connections to the million -
 acre George Washington National Forest to the east and along the
 mountain ridges to Maryland and Pennsylvania State Forests. It is
 the regional center and support for the ultimate recovery of
 biodiversity in a vast complex of rugged mountains and hills to the
 west and southwest.
 <p>
 
 
 The Monongahela has
 inspired several recent proposals for expanded wilderness, in
 particular Robert Stough's (1990) &quot;Wilderness Manifesto&quot;
 and Ed Lytwak's (1991) &quot; The Monongahela Forest, An Alternative
 Vision.&quot; It is generally agreed among those who share this
 vision that we should finish, not with isolated wilderness tracts in
 otherwise hostile terrain, but with integrated preserves in which
 wilderness cores are linked by broad migration corridors and
 enveloped by buffer zones where only low impact human activities
 occur(1). Advocated particularly by Noss (1983, 1987), the
 wilderness/corridor system was adapted to the Appalachians by the
 writer (Mueller,1985) and by Sayen (1987). Recently it has been
 elaborated for the George Washington National Forest (Mueller, 1991
) and has been incorporated as an alternative in the pending plan
 for the GWNF.
 <p>
 
 Currently there
 five areas, comprising 78,131 acres, of designated Wilderness in the
 Monongahela: Cranberry (35,864 acres), Dolly Sods (10,215), Laurel
 Fork North (6055), Laurel Fork South (5997) and Otter Creek
 (20,000). Several of these areas, in particular the Cranberry and
 Otter Creek, would lend themselves to immediate substantial
 expansion, each perhaps doubling in area. This would be especially
 easy for the Cranberry Wilderness since the adjacent Cranberry Back
 Country already has its roads closed to private vehicles. In answer
 to a recent inquiry, the Forest Service stated (letter, 6 - 3 - 91) that there is currently no roadless area review and evaluation
 (RARE) study of the Monongahela, and that no formal proposals for
 additional wilderness have been made by citizens.
 <p>
 
 The Monongahela
 varies considerably in terrain and climate, with elevations ranging
 from less than 1000 feet above sea level near Petersburg, West
 Virginia to 4862 feet on Spruce Knob. Precipitation increases more
 than 30 inches per year from east to west so that the linear, folded
 mountains of the Valley and Ridge lie in the rain shadow of the high
 Alleghenies. Mean temperatures in the region may vary 10 deg F, with
 the lowest temperatures in the high valleys where air drains down
 from the peaks. These variations in climate have created habitat
 islands in which northern disjuncts or other species formed small
 isolated populations. Such populations are vulnerable to genetic
 deterioration and stochastic effects such as localized disturbances.
 <p>
 
 The parent forest
 type of the Monongahela is mixed mesophytic and was derived from
 similar forests that have occupied the Appalachians and other forest
 centers such as Europe and East Asia since Tertiary times (Braun,
 1950) . It shows its most characteristic development at elevations
 below 2500 feet and in the southern Monongahela. It is diverse with
 a number of species each of magnolias, oaks, hickories, walnuts,
 elms, birches, ashes, basswoods, maples, locusts and pines. here
 also are Tuliptree, Black Gum, Eastern Hemlock, Black Cherry,
 American Beech and the type indicator Yellow Buckeye. American
 Chestnut, now stunted by disease, once was a major component. In a
 mature forest these canopy trees tower over an equally complex
 understory of small trees and shrubs and an exceedingly rich ground
 cover of flowering plants, ferns, fungi, etc. On ascent to higher
 elevations southern species gradually drop out, northern species
 such as Yellow Birch and Mountain Maple appear, and Sugar Maple,
 Beech and Eastern Hemlock assume dominance. This is the Hemlock -
 White Pine - northern Hardwood Forest of Lucy brown. it has a
 distinctly northern quality in both woody and herbaceous floras and
 may appear identical to forests of the Adirondack foothills or New
 England. However, it frequently contains traces of typically
 Southern and Central Appalachian species such as Fraser and Cucumber
 Magnolias and black Locust. In some places Great Rhododendron (
 <i>Rhododendron maximum</i>) forms heavy understory thickets, a
 feature uncharacteristic of northern forests.
 <p>
 Above 3500 feet,
 the northern mixed forest yields gradually to a Red Spruce montane
 forest of boreal appearance. In this forest, circumpolar flowering
 plants such as <i>Oxalis montana</i> and <i>Coptis groenlandica</i> or
 lycopods and mosses dominate the ground cover, while shrubs are rare
 because of the dense shade. Formerly forest of this kind covered
 almost 500,000 acres in West Virginia. It is now recovering from the
 period of destructive logging and fires. Yet this forest is, in
 biological terms, island habitat.
 <p>
 
 
 Toward the east and
 coinciding roughly with the western edge of the Valley and Ridge
 Province, where conditions are dryer than in the Alleghenies, there
 is a broad ecotone between the mixed mesophyte forest and more xeric
 oak - chestnut type forests of the George Washington National
 Forest.
 <p>
 Within the large
 tracts of these major forest types is a considerable number of
 restricted habitats such as glades (open wetlands or other openings), heath barrens, grass balds, shale barrens, caves and exposed
 cliffs and peaks. The wetland glades are complex and include
 sphagnum bogs with peat beds, fens, marshes and shrub and forest
 swamps. Because of generally high elevations they are home to a
 wealth of northern species (2), some common, such as cranberries,
 blueberries, viburnums and hollies, and some rare disjuncts like Bog
 Rosemary (<i>Andromeda glaucophylla</i>), Buckbean (<i>Menyanthes
 trifoliata</i>) and Scheuchzeria (<i>Scheuchzeria palustris</i>).
 Many glades resulted in part from Beaver action and have extensive
 Speckled Alder (<i>Alnus rugosa</i>) thickets as well as open
 water or the derivative meadows and successional flora.
 
 <p>
 <p>
 The high plateaus
 of the northern Monongahela and vicinity (Dolly Sods, Roaring
 Plains etc.) are known for their extensive rocky heath barrens
 which resulted in part from post - logging fires (Clarkson, 1966).
 Here in open terrain, wind - shaped &quot;banner&quot; Red Spruce
 rise among a northern flora that includes Trembling Aspen, Mountain
 Ash and Mountain Holly (<i>Nemopanthus mucronata</i>) and a
 variety of characteristic Appalachian heaths such as Mountain
 Laurel, Minnie - bush (<i>Menziesia pilosa</i>), Great
 Rhododendron, azaleas, huckleberries etc. The northern components of
 the Monongahela may comprise as much as ten percent of all native
 vascular plants of the Forest and a sustatial number of these are at
 or near their southernmost stations and vulnerable to island
 effects. Associated northern fauna includes Northern Flying
 Squirrel, Varying Hare, Fisher and the southernmost breeding grounds
 for passerines such as the Hermit Thrush, Swainson's Thrush, Purple
 finch, several warblers, and others. The Canaan Valley (outlined by
 a dashed line on the map), a premier glade complex at 3200 ft.
 elevation, contains 40 percent of West Virginia's wetlands. These
 glades host the southernmost breeding pairs of Common Snipe as well
 as a disjunct Black Duck population. The Northern Goshawk, a bird of
 remote northern forests, and the Black - billed Magpie (<i>Pica
 pica</i>), a western bird, have nested there.
 
 <p>
 Shale barren
 floras, concentrated east of the Allegheny Front in the Valley and
 Ridge Province, are similar to those of the George Washington N. F.
 in species and adaptation to local hot, dry conditions. Even more
 restricted are the floras of certain isolated cliffs and peaks such
 as Panther Knob, which boasts the only occurrence in West Virginia
 of Michaux's Saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga micauxii</i>) as well as the
 coastal disjunct False Heather (<i>Hudsonia tomentosa</i>) .
 Silvery Nailwort (<i>Paronychia argyrocoma</i>) is found only on
 Tuscarora quartzite, of which the most famous exposure is Seneca
 Rocks in the North Fork Mountains.
 <p>
 Native diversity
 and ecological integrity of the Monongahela have undergone
 considerable diminution since the arrival of Europeans, and this
 trend continues. We can only wonder what rare endemics might have
 been lost through logging, fires and agricultural practices that
 destroyed the very soil of much of the region. It seems possible
 that some currently rare trees such as Eastern Larch (now confined
 to the Cranesville Swamp north of the map area), Balsam Fir and Red
 Pine were more common in the original conifer forest which once
 dominated the higher elevations. Since the National Forest was
 established, extensive road building, clearcutting and other
 developments have diminished, extirpated or possibly extinguished a
 number of species. An example is the Canada Yew (<i>Taxus
 canadensis</i>), a northern evergreen shrub which was once common
 at high elevations but has been virtually extirpated by deer
 browsing. This is the pattern throughout the Canada Yew's range and
 has been documented in detail by Alverson, Waller and Solheim (1988
) in Wisconsin. In all probability, as in Wisconsin, a number of
 herbaceous plants are at risk of the same fate(3). The timber and
 &quot;game management&quot; policies have led to this situation
 through the creation of edge effects and abundant early successional
 vegetation. In the absence of large predators, edge - dwelling
 species such as raccoons, opossums and foxes prey upon vulnerable
 and rare forest interior species.
 <p>
 Seemingly following
 the early example of Earth First! visionaries, Alverson et al
 proposed the creation of late successional habitat consisting of
 50,00 to 100,000 acre preserves. This would have the effect of
 diminishing deer food and general edge effects. However they failed
 to stress the need for large predators. The creation of a number of
 wilderness preserves in this size range is, as we shall see,
 possible on the Monongahela. However this step should be regarded
 merely as a prelude to the complete rewilding of these forests with
 Cougars, Gray Wolves and other extirpated species.
<p>

</ul>
<h2>Proposed
Wilderness Corridor System</h2>
<ul>
<p>

 The proposed
 system consists of 19 new Wilderness Areas and expansions of those
 already designated. These new and expanded Wildernesses are defined
 by hatched solid borders on the map. Linking corridors are shown by
 speckled solid borders and the enveloping buffer zones by hatched
 dotted borders. Existing Wilderness Areas are defined by thin dotted
 lines where their boundaries differ from proposed Wilderness Areas.
 Some areas referred to in the text are indicated on the map by
 numbers.
 <p>
 The system is
 concentrated on National Forest tracts, but in certain critical
 areas is extended to private lands with the assumption that these
 will be purchased or protected in some other way. The criteria used
 in drawing boundaries of the three categories are based on existing
 land ownership, land use and ecological imperatives. Thus, while
 developed and inhabited areas are for the most part excluded, the
 extension of important natural features or ecosystems onto private
 wildlands necessitates that the latter be included. A notable
 example is the Dolly Sods Wilderness extension along Cabin Mountain
 1, encompassing the northern Canaan Valley and associated corridors
 and buffers, a design with an intent to protect from and purge ski
 condominium development which threatens the entire watershed. The
 proposed Wilderness Areas would necessitate closure of a number of
 Forest System roads, examples being FR 19 on the edge of the
 existing Dolly Sods Wilderness, FR 112 southwest of Spruce Knob and
 FR 86 along the Williams River.
 <p>
 Corridors would be
 managed in much the same way as Wilderness, allowing the forest to
 revert to old growth under natural disturbance regimes as much as
 possible. As many corridor roads as possible would be closed. The
 standards of roads kept open would be scaled back, with reduced
 width, speed limit and break in forest canopy. Within the buffer
 zones land disturbing activities would be discouraged and existing
 developments phased out where possible.
 <p>
 The northern
 Monongahela and vicinity includes an extraordinary conjunction of
 habitats and biologic communities to be protected under the proposed
 system. The system would build on the Dolly Sods and otter Creek
 Wildernesses. It would extend Dolly Sods along the heath barren
 plateau of Cabin Mountain and northwestward to include the extensive
 wetlands of the northern Canaan Valley, where a riverine complex
 forms an ecotone with a recovering hardwood - conifer forest.
 Westward from the Canaan Valley a corridor extends along the
 Blackwater River, a beautiful stream darkened by natural organic
 pigments(4). This corridor connects to the Canaan Mountain block 2.
 and from there to the Otter Creek Wilderness which has been expanded
 to include the critical riparian zones along Glady Fork and an area
 west of the present boundary.
 <p>
 Southward a broad
 corridor lies along Laurel Fork and extends to a greatly expanded
 Laurel Fork north (LF N.) and South (LF. S.) Wilderness Units.
 To the east short corridor links the proposed Roaring plains 3 and
 Spruce Mountain Units.
 <p>
 East of the
 Allegheny Front in the spectacular North Fork range of the Valley
 and Ridge Province a 30 mile Wilderness/Corridor unit extends from
 near Pertersburg southwestward to the Virginia line where it joins
 the proposed Laurel Fork Wilderness of the George Washington
 National Forest 4. From there a seven mile wide corridor extends
 northward to the proposed 35.000 acre block of the expanded Laurel
 Fork South Wilderness centered on Blister Swamp 5. The latter is the
 site of a disjunct northern plant community including Balsam Fir
 (5}, which should be top priority for addition to the Forest. From
 this area a corridor extends to the vicinity of Cheat Bridge 6, a
 botanical region made famous by the Long - stalked Holly (<i>Ilex
 collina</i>) and Asa Gray's botanical sweep. In this vicinity, at
 Blister Run, is one of the planet's southernmost stands of Balsam
 Fir, which is here reproducing well because deer have abundant
 alternative browse. This corridor is designed to access two large
 blocks of proposed Wilderness southwest of Route 250 divided by a
 railway along Shaver's Fork &amp;. Encompassing the recently
 acquired 40.000 acre Mower tract addition to the Monongahela, these
 blocks straddle peaks over 4500 feet in elevation.
 <p>
 From Cheat Mountain
 a corridor turns sharply west connecting it to the proposed Gauly
 Mountain Wilderness block 8, which is separated only by a power line
 right - of - way from the largest possible Wilderness in the Forest,
 the 100,000 - acre plus Cranberry Wilderness expansion.
 <p>
 The Cranberry block
 and surroundings include a variety of forest ecosystems ranging from
 lush mixed mesophyte at lower elevations to pure spruce above 4000
 feet. They are known for their abundant glades, as exemplified by
 the famous Cranberry Botanical Area which lies just outside the
 existing Cranberry Wilderness. Lying at 3400 feet elevation, it is
 home to many of the rare and disjunct flora and fauna previously
 mentioned. However, in common with other areas, it no longer
 contains Canada Yew. As a result of deer browsing, little or no Yew
 survives in the Yew Mountains or along Yew Creek!
 <p>
 The Cranberry lies
 in the highest part of the dissected Allegheny Plateau, which has an
 extension southwestward of route 39 in the Cherry River drainage 10.
 In access of 50,000 acres, this block consists entirely of private
 land within the proclamation boundary and is threatened by proposed
 coal - fired power plants, mines and transmission lines. It is
 imperative that it be protected, preferably by addition to the
 Forest.
 <p>
 From the Cherry
 River block a broad corridor 11 has been extended open - endedly
 toward the New River Gorge. With their buffer zones, these areas
 have a potential of more than 200,000 acres of wildlands divided by
 only one major highway.<p>
 
 Southeast of the
 Cranberry - Cherry River complex and the Greenbrier River a salient
 12 of the Monongahela extends 30 miles along the Virginia State line
 in the transition zone between mixed mesophyte and oak - chestnut
 forest to the east. Most of this forest which, as along Anthony
 Creek, contains rich mixed mesophyte stands, has been incorporated
 into nine newly proposed Wilderness Areas.
 One of these areas,
 north of Route 39, includes part of the George Washington national
 Forest 13, and thus forges a wilderness link toward the east.
 
 </ul>
<h2>
Summary and Course
of Action</h2>
<ul>
<p>

 The Monongahela
 National Forest and the highlands of which it forms a part have
 impressive ecological credentials. In many Eastern forests tends to
 the cryptic, concealed to the untrained eye in the apparent
 uniformity of lush deciduous foliage. But in this region diversity
 is resplendent in contrasting deciduous forest, conifer, glade and
 other facies that attract an equally diverse fauna. But all this is
 under threat or actual assault by the perpetrators of an endless
 variety of despoilation schemes. Heading the list is road -
 building, with the worst being the infamous &quot;Corridor H&quot;
 proposal to split the northern part of the Forest with an interstate
 highway. Road - building is closely followed in destructiveness by
 power plant and transmission line schemes, one of which would defile
 the here - proposed Cherry River Wilderness south of Route 39 as
 well as the Cranberry Wilderness. Other threats come from ongoing
 ski condominium development, particularly on Cabin Mountain and in
 Canaan Valley. Finally, forming an ever present backdrop of steady
 degradation are the misdirected U.S. Forest Service and State
 management practices. These multiple debasements not only impact the
 highlands but are in many ways transmitted to remote habitats, from
 the tropics to the Arctic, through their effects on migrating
 species. Only ecological restoration and restructuring based on
 large wilderness can mitigate this deterioration.<p>
 
 A
 Wilderness/Corridor System as fully developed as this would of
 necessity be integrated with the regional human culture in a
 bioregional model (Lytwak, 1991) . Perhaps the best known example
 of such integration in practice, albeit in its initial stage, is
 Guanacaste National Park in Costa Rica. As conceived by the
 biologist Daniel Jansen (Allen, 1988), the primary mission at
 Guanacaste is the restoration of a tract of tropical dry forest but
 serving the secondary function of a &quot;living classroom&quot;
 with the intimate involvement of local human inhabitants in day to
 day operations. Thus an ecological dimension is given to schooling
 and employment. Although human cultures in West Virginia and Costa
 Rica are not directly comparable, they are - like modern cultures
 everywhere - severed from their ecological roots and generally
 ignorant of the impact of the machine culture on nature.
 Consequently the Monongahela Preserve may with equal justification
 serve as a living classroom. Such a system, consisting of large
 blocks of unfragmented habitat tending toward maturity and
 approximating natural disturbance regimes, presents unusual
 opportunities for scientific baselines against which to measure
 anthropogenic degradation.<p>
 
 Although the
 ultimate justification for a Wilderness/Corridor System must be
 ecological and ethical, economic concerns also need to be addressed
 if the system is to succeed. As in the Guanacoste example,
 employment opportunities would be created for local inhabitants.
 Some of this employment would be ecological restoration; while more
 would result from accommodating and guiding tourists, students,
 scientists and other research personnel. New businesses and
 employment would be created by privatization and moving concentrated
 recreation facilities, such as developed campsites, from public to
 private lands. Zoning regulations would maintain standards
 comparable to the public facilities vacated or supplanted.

<h2>
What Wilderness
proponents Are Doing</h2>
<ul>
<p>

 Proponents of
 wilderness are writing letters to: the Supervisor, Monongahela
 National Forest (200 Sycamore St., Elkins, West Virginia 26241) ;
 Governor [ Robert Wise ] (State Capitol of West Virginia,
 Charleston, West Virginia 25305) ; Representatives (U.S. House of
 Representatives, Washington, D.C. 20515) and Senators (U.S. Senate
 Building, Washington D.C. 20510) . They are asking that the
 Monongahela National Forest be planned as a Wilderness/Corridor
 System to restore and protect its biodiversity and evolutionary
 potential and to allow for the migration of species as required by
 global warming. In addition, they are telling the Governor to scrap
 any Corridor H highway and to ban mineral development in the region.
