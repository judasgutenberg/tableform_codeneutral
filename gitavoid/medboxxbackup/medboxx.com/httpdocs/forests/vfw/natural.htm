Re: Rare "mountain pond" on Mill MouDtain
<p>
Dear Dr. Mueller:
<p>
Thank you for drawing my attention to the mountain pond on Mill
Mountaln in the Warm Springs Ranger District. We have reviewed
our flles on this area, and have some information that may be of
lnterest to you.
<p>
As correctly indicated in your letter of 6 March, a field survey
of the Pond Ridge "mountain pond" was conducted by the Department
of Conservation and Recreation - Division of Natural Heritage
botanist in l9SS. He found the site to be small and lacking in
rare plants, but a good example of a rare community in "almost
pristine" condition. The site is currently monitored by this
Division as the Pond Ridge conservation site. The natural
heritage resource at this site is recognized as oligotrophic
seasonally flooded herbaceous vegetation.
<p>
Unfortunately, I have no information to explain why our
botanist's recommendations that the site be designated as a
Special Interest Area (SIA) cr a Research Natural Area (RNA) have
not ccme to fruition. It may be that the site's small size and
lack of rare plants kept it from being viewed as a top priority
for protection. In any event, we are taking the appropriate
steps with the U. S . Forest Service to designate the Pond Ridge
site for SIA or RNA status.
<p>
As for your fears regarding the pond's imminent destructicn, let
me reassure you that they are unfounded. I have contacted the
Fcrest Service and verified that the Pcnd Ridge site lies well
within the boundary of Management Area g in the George Washington
National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan. Management
Area 9 includes the Remcte Highlands which are mansged to
<p>
provide older vegetation, unfragmented forested habitat for
forest-interior species, and light (primarily non-motorized)
recreation for those seeking solitude on the Forest. Remote
Highlands are also considered unsuitable for timber production.
<p>
In addition, the Natural Heritage environmental review team
receives scoping notices for all timber harvests and other
ground-disturbing activities on the George Washington National
Forest. Regardless of the management prescribed for Pond Ridge,
we will submit appropriate recommendations for the protection of
this rare community in response to any action proposed in its
vicinity.
<p>
As previously mentioned, I appreciate your efforts to alert us to
potential threats facing Virginia's natural heriatage resources.
However, I must take exception with your use of vulgar language
and unwarranted insults to the dedicated professionals that make
up the Division of Natural Heritage. These tactics not only
serve to alienate fellow conservation biologists, they rob you of
credibility as a spokesperson for biodiversity preservation.
Although it is difficult to see beyond the expletives and
creative punctuation in your letters, I can tell that their
source is an individual with a passion for preservation that is
admirable. If more of the passion and less of the anger showed
through in your correspondence to individuals who may share your
agenda, you may enjoy greater success in realizing your goals.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
