Somebody email me a copy. Thanks.<br><dd>I've been working remotely with a team of people from that Austin-based company that my company recently acquired.  The project I'm working on is clearly some sort of bone thrown to the other company, an effort to get them up to speed with our management system.  But of course, since they have no access to our local network and no one skilled in either ASP or Microsoft SQL, I'm the one who has to do all the development, front to back.  To make matters worse, the team leader is a rather pushy woman who is, let us just say, lacking in a sense of humour.  She wants everything done her way, and everything she tells me reeks of condescension.  Today she called me on the phone (Email?  What's email?) about a table that was being rendered improperly on a Mac running Internet Explorer (who uses IE on a Mac?).  Evidently I'd swapped the placement of &lt;td&gt;/&lt;/td&gt; tags in one of my table-drawing scripts.  I clearly got the impression that she felt the need to tell me that this was unacceptable, as though I was going to try to weasel out of fixing it, leaving her to have to settle with a 4000-pixel wide table.<p></blockquote></font><p><center><font size=-1 color=666666 face=arial><a href="../feedback.php?subject=a+bone+thrown+to+Austin">send me mail</a><br><a href=991128.htm>previous</a> |<! href=991130.htm>next</a></center></font></body></html>
