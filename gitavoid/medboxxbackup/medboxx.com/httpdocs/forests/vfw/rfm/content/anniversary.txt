ANNIVERSARY 1984
|||
Can you believe it?  Twenty  years ago!
Like Ludwig in the country, a pastoral,
I wish that it would never end
but know it must some day.
To make it last, let’s walk in the woods again,
a pleasure we’ve neglected some of late.

We started in the city and you didn’t know how much I liked the trees
but learned I loved the female trunk okay.
O I want you to know me as an enthusiastic hugger
of all life as well as rocks and humble clay.

Can you forgive me for exploiting you for so many years?
If you can I’d like to do it for twenty more or so!

As I write this, we've already exceeded the twenty extra years!
