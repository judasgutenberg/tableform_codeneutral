CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN|

On that December day of '45 she became part of my life, 
Of that vision unbelievably recoiling to 
The same wide streets, the wire-fenced fields, 
The trees spooling past the 400's northward drive, 
The rhythmic clack of steel in oil 
Shucking off the foreign days and nights. 
My uniform was the opening 
To her elegant brunet's fur-coated style, 
The introduction to her smile, 
There in the gently swaying blue-green plush,
With faintest smoke-of-diesel smell, and beyond 
The outward dash of increasingly familiar miles 
Toward the station stop 
Where, helplessly, I saw her step into my past.

This incident was an example of my faintheartedness around desirable women, faintheartedness and insecurity that resulted from self-perception as an uneducated rube. I had of course gained some bravado from my experience in Europe, but it was inadequate in the old familiar American social setting that rushed back on me in this instance.
