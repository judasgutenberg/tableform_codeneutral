HILLS
|||
On a hill I feel the unity of the world and the redundancy of roads.
There I can see the distant hills, blue, just visible,
From which I could see other hills, plains, lakes, and on and on,
Reaching to where I was born.
I can see crows, swifts and hawks
Stitching together while I watch
All the bright places of my life, and at night,
While stars swarm above, the wind
Is still here while I sleep.

I've always felt a unity in my experiences in Wisconsin and Virginia, because both were and are dominated by Nature. The natural areas of Virginia are similar enough to those of Wisconsin to share many native species, both plant and animal, and which I first encountered as a child. Consequently there exists an emotional as well as a scientific bond in my mind, and is one motivation for starting and pursuing the "Virginians for Wilderness" group and the "Forests of the Central Appalachians Project."
