I DIDN'T KNOW YOU THEN
|||

I didn't know you then; 
I didn't know you when 
Time was rushing fast
Along the snaky miles, 
The winding 50's roads 
That left behind my past. 
In my Chevy rocket ship
I fled along those roads 
Past stubble fields, the 
Lighted chore-time barns, 
The yellow dead grass knolls, 
Toward a brightening sky, 
The University space time 50's world 
Where the past would leave no residue. 
I didn't know it then, that 
I was hurtling toward our rendezvous.

I didn't know you then: 
I didn't know you when 
My nights were burning late 
The endless taper of my hope 
Behind the grudging hallway doors 
In rooms so celibate. 
Could I have fixed your voice 
In the tempting ventriloquistic laughter 
Of the girls behind the walls, 
Beyond my festering desk and blotter, 
They who haunted me forever after? 
Among the faceless classroom crowds, 
The parade of fellow roomers, 
Would I have caught your eye? 
Or would I have sensed you then 
Among the nameless passers-by?

While at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, it was usual for me to drive home on weekends, with Karl W, a fellow student from Menasha, as a passenger in my 41 Chevrolet. Frequently, however, I returned to Madison alone. Recreated here is a mood derived from recollections of such return trips. Also recreated is the mood of my life as a student roomer entrapped by stimulating but demanding studies, which left little time for female company- all seen here as a prelude to the years-later advent of my wife Betty.
