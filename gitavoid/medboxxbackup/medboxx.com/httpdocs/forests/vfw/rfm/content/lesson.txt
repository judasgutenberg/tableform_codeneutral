THE LESSON
|||
In that lumber yard she taught me life’s oldest tricks.
No, not board feet or measuring sticks
but something so startling and awesome
it primed sense buds lying too deep
for years of trying to satiate.

 Children, even in the 1920s and 30s, were far from innocent, and we also swiped yardsticks from this lumber yard, which, split lengthwise, were ideal for kite making. And, although I attended a school taught by nuns, "eight pagers", that included the exploits of Popeye and Olive Oil and Toots and Casper, circulated freely among us. Additionally, we had a lexicon of private parts-most of which is probably no longer in use.
