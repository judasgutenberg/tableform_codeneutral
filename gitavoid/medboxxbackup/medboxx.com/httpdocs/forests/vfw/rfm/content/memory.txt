MEMORY
|||

Down the years I see your little pushface 
though you must be scraggly-toothed now, wrinkled, old. 
The naked sun, the towering fields, the trellis leading down, 
the fuss made by mothers over visiting tikes 
I still remember. 
I was to take you out to play, and 
hiding all the hate I did. 
And behind the green wall I made you cry. 
O I really got you good, and I was glad 
when I was only four and you were maybe three.

Surely this is one of my earliest memories of independent action.
