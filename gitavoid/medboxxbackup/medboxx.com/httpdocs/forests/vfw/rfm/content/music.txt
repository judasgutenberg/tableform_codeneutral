MUSIC AT THE JACKSON|
(enjoyed frequently with my Love!)|
|
Inside the bluegrass is authentic 
As the flight of banjos to the stars, 
The low ambrosial strumming 
Of the electric-juiced guitars, 
The sound of mandolins that weave 
A belt of jewels across the room. 
But is this the sad metallic ringing 
That broke the twilight of the coves, 
Or that can call up again the shadows 
Of-the winding river groves,
Brought to the Stonewall Jackson from afar?

2.
Outside the Datsuns and Toyotas 
Snap in the balmy evening air.
Yet not a single wheel is dented 
By the broken axle roads 
That snake downhill like rivers 
With their gravel in repose. 
And the long haired youthful players 
Who drove them here today 
Left apartments in the city 
Where they never learned to pray.

3.
Think then of a lonely hollow 
And the hills in evening's fire, 
When a sweat-soaked lanky player 
Puts his cornfield's rows to rest, 
And lets his fancy light the shake-roofed cabin 
In the quiet mountain gloom, 
As his melody climbs upward 
To meet the rising moon.

4.
And remember that at present 
All we can ever know
Is that we're at the Hotel Jackson 
For a night, a drink, a show.

The Stonewall Jackson Hotel was part of a niche in the "good life" of our new Virginia home, although it conflicted flagrantly with the ideal of self-sufficiency professed by homesteaders like us. In addition to weekly evening entertainment, I on occasion joined Betty-who taught at the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind- there for sumptuous noon meals that only increased my guilt!
