Sitting there on those granite boulders 
Radiating your mid-American chic as well as you can,
The water falling behind you has long since 
Repeatedly cycled and impinged on this your yellowed print. 
It was easy for me to think of your life 
Since we parted as one long drag. 
But that doesn't explain why you struck a chord 
That first night I asked you to dance at the Rainbow, 
The wrench of stumbling phone calls, 
Idealizing fantasies, and later 
The surreptitious glances on each 
Drive past the place where we used to park. 
Perhaps you once had a vision of us among 
Those bright varnished benches with light 
Streaming through the slightly garish stained glass, 
There among the cologne-washed incense smells. 
If so Nelda, I know now I should have been flattered.

The picture of the subject of my affection posed before a waterfall gave an impetus to this poem that might otherwise have been lacking.
