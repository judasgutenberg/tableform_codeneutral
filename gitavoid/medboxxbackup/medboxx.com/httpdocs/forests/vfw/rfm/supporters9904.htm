<P><dd>November of last year, after our last report, saw completion of the field work in the Pedlar River Watershed and Ramsey's Draft in Virginia. Since then most of our effort has been devoted to reducing our field notes to literary form and placing the results on our website. Recently "Cranberry Glades and Vicinity", a major effort in this classic area of West Virginia was installed there. A greatly expanded and revised inventory of the biologically diverse Blowing Springs Area of Virginia is in the works for our website also.</P>
<P><dd>In February of this year we were notified by Scott Spencer of the US Dept. of Agriculture's Inspector General's Office that our work had born fruit in the form of audits of the Clinch and Deerfield Districts of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests that culminated in the IG Evaluation Report # 08801-10-AT. This report, a direct outgrowth of the Forests of the Central Appalachians Project, included severe reprimands for violations of the Endangered Species Act and other laws and resulted in stopping a number of timber sales and other destructive activities in those districts. Unfortunately however, these actions involved only a fraction of our complaints, and we were told that the IG lacked resources to act on more of these.</P>
<P><dd>An additional project initiated by us this year is a proposal for an Ernie Dickerman Wilderness to honor this most effective wilderness advocate in the eastern US who died recently. This would be the largest national forest wilderness in the East at 65,000 acres. Part of our Project effort this year will be devoted to documenting the ecologic assets of the proposal area. We look forward to an active field season!</P>
<P><dd>If you have any questions about any of our work, don't hesitate to ask us.</P>
