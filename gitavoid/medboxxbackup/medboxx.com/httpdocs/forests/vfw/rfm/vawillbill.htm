<h2>The Wilderness Bill for the Jefferson National Forest</h2>

	Virginians for Wilderness strongly support the new wilderness bill: "The Virginia Ridge and Valley Wilderness and National Scenic Areas Act (S. 2342 and HR 4202)", which has been introduced by Virginia Sen. Warner and Rep. Rick Boucher. It would protect an additional 29,000 acres of the Jefferson National Forest as Wilderness and 12,000 acres as National Scenic Area. Four new wilderness areas would be created and five existing wilderness areas expanded  The sponsors should be thanked, and a request should be made to Virginia Sen, George Allen to co-sponsor this bill as well. Phone numbers are as follows:
