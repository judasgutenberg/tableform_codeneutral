Mr. Sherwood:<p>
Re: your Whitetop Opportunity Area Analysis scoping notice of Jan. 15, 1993:<p>
	I don't know whether to laugh or cry about this.  Was this written "under the
influence"?  Certainly it's one of the most incompetent and silly documents
I've seen in a while.  It's also profoundly anti-ecological and uncaring of
public input you already have.<p>
	The complex subdivision you propose for this OA amounts to "fragmentation by
management."  Just what do you mean by stating "In MA 1,3 and 5 lands are
considered unsuitable for timber production" and in the <i>same</i> paragraph:
"In MA 5 lands, timber management will utilize uneven-aged management
principles in order to maintain a healthy stand of Northern Hardwood."?  Is
this Forest service logic?<p>
	Please provide evidence that stands greater than 60 years old "show signs of
stagnation and mortality" beyond that normal for this age forest.<p>
	You also take the cake by your already executed -- without consultation--
effort to compensate logging destruction of rare salamander habitat by
<i>more</i> logging to provide down wood habitat.  Given the impact of any
logging on salamanders this is not simple idiocy but criminal idiocy!  I
suggest that you wet your finger and read Raymond and Hardy (<i>Journal of
Herpetology 25</i> (4) 1991) and Petranka <i>et a</i>l if you can get their
preprint. Can you really be so ignorant as to cite "decay" as the major threat
to salamanders, and logging as their salvation?  Such twisting of the facts is
a hallmark of the propaganda machines of repressive dictatorships.  Salamanders
depend on decay...rotting wood holds the moisture salamanders depend upon, and
rotting wood feeds the microbes at the base of the food pyramid that
salamanders are nourished by.  And decay and moisture depend on dense shade.
Where is the shade in a "clearcut/shelterwood cut/group selection
cut/artificial bald/linear opening/wildlife sunning zone/spotted knapweed
reserve/grouse habitat improvement site/cottontail salvation cut"?  Any lack of
down wood for salamanders reflects a lack of old growth.  Logging only destroys
old growth, and salamanders with it.<p>
	I don't like the sneaky way you're attempting to avoid discussing here your
ill-fated attempt to reconstruct the Whitetop road.  What does it mean to
incorporate it into the Whitetop OA "by reference"?  And why haven't you
addressed the issues raised in my appeal and in previous comments on that
destructive proposal by many respondents?  We demand that this road be closed
and that the law be strictly enforced to prevent the on-going ORV destruction
of this fragile mountain top.  <b>I would like my appeal of Whitetop Road to be
considered as part of my comment on this Whitetop OA .  Issues raised in my
appeal of Whitetop Road must still be addressed.</b><p>
<b></b>	What do you mean by stating that openings "offer a substantial grazing
resource and an &aelig;sthetically valuable contrast to the coniferous and
hardwood forests"?  Whose &aelig;sthetics?  And how about fragmentation,
destructive edge effects and incursion of alien species?  Certainly the
respondents to your proposal to reconstruct the road don't share your outdated
concept of &aelig;sthetics.  They, virtually to a person, want a <i>natural
mountain</i>.  It's time to eliminate all grazing on mountain tops in the NRA.
That's what the responding public wants.<p>
	I also protest your clutzy, doctrinaire and anti-ecological adherence to the
featured species concept, a concept merely designed to allow you to "manage."
The percentage of hard mast, old growth, grass forb, browse etc. listed as
ideal for various "game" animals are stupidly artificial and don't correspond
to any real requirements.  For example why isn't any old growth listed for Gray
Squirrel?  Let's face it, featured species are only an excuse for you to cut
trees, build roads, poison arthropods, etc. as your action on the salamanders
demonstrates.<p>
	With respect to old growth, the percentages you propose are far too small.
This entire fragile mountain top should be designated as developing old growth.
It's a special place as undoubtedly was recognized by the native Americans who
probably utilized it for spiritual reasons.<p>
	Finally, your lip service to the concept of a "healthy, vigorous forest" is a
joke.  You don't have a clue what a healthy forest is.  To you a forest is
nothing but extractables --timber, huntable wildlife, ramps, maple sap, &amp;
on &amp; on.  You ignore all the rest, the delicate web of life, the forest as
nature intended.  You want to straight jacket nature with your expensive,
energy intensive and wasteful "management" based on outdated &aelig;sthetics
and plain greed.  But we're on to you.  Americans demand more than lip service
to ecology.  They demand the real thing.  Back to the drawing boards on this
Mr. Sherwood.  The word is out.  This won't do.<p>
