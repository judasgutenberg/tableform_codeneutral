<p><h1>Warm Springs Mountain</h1>
<b>June, 2002</b>

<blockquote>


 
<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<p>	Warm Springs Mountain is typical of those ridges
capped by Silurian sandstone or quartzite.  The range extends
southwest 28 miles (45 km) from Burnsville to Covington, Virginia and
averages about three miles (5 km) in width.  It attains elevations of
4000 ft (1200 meters) in several places, with a maximum of 4225 ft
(1288 meters) on Bald Knob east of Carloover.  Structurally it is
part of an anticline which also extends northeast to form Jack
Mountain.  A major feature of this anticline is a breach in which the
capping of resistant sandstone has been eroded away from the
northwest limb for part of its length.  This breach, which extends
from a little north of the village of Warm Springs to about 6 miles
(10 km) north of Covington, exposes a variety of Ordovician rocks
that give rise to soils and plant communities quite different from
those on sandstone  (Mueller and Mueller, 1997).  Examples are the
Martinsburg Formation which consists largely of calcareous shales and
the Moccasin and Beekmantown which are predominantly limestone and
dolomite.  The latter form the floor of the Warm Springs Valley just
west of the Range  (Rader and Evans, 1993 ; Bick, 1962).  In  an
earlier paper it was proposed that Warm Springs Mountain be
designated a corridor in a Wilderness - corridor system for the
George Washington National Forest  (Mueller, 1991),  However,
recently The Nature Conservancy  (2002, White, 2002)  acquired 9000
acres  (3600 ha)  on the Mountain, so that classification as
wilderness  now seems more appropriate.</p>
<p>	While the limestones and dolomites of the Warm
Springs Valley support the best agricultural lands and richest mesic
forest types, the slopes of Warm Springs Mountain also show evidence
of differing rock types in land use and ownership patterns.  For
example the presence of underlying Ordovician rock, chiefly
Martinsburg Formation, is shown by a greater degree of land clearing,
gentle slopes and private ownership on the northwest side of the
range as compared with the more rugged and heavily forested SE side,
which is underlain primarily by Silurian rocks. On both the NE and SW
ends of the Range, where the anticline is closed, xeric, ericaceous
forests occupy rugged terrain.  The conformity of land ownership to
geologic structure is also shown by the location of national forest
land, which generally is restricted to the least productive and
steepest terrain.</p>

<h2>Warm Spring Mountain at Muddy Run</h2>
<ul>
<p><b>Source Walk: 8-13-95, Weather very warm</b></p>
<p>	Muddy Run, a branch of the Jackson River, lies at
the bottom of the NW slope of Warm Springs Mtn. in the closed part of
the anticline.  Rocks are chiefly Silurian Clinton Formation and
Clinch Sandstone (Bick, 1962).  The slope forest here, except for the
immediate vicinity of the stream, is dry and ericaceous and the
stream-side forest is dominantly acid-soil vegetation.</p>
<p>	A spot inventory was conducted in the
vicinity of a 2520 ft. (768 meter) benchmark along Va. Route 614. 
The forest here is young, perhaps little more than 50 years in age
with a canopy dominated by Scarlet, Black, Northern Red, White and
Chestnut Oaks  (<i>Quercus  coccinea, Q.  velutina, Q. rubra,  Q. 
alba </i>and  <i>Q. prinus</i>).   Also present are Red Maple  (<i>Acer
 rubrum</i>),  Black Birch   (<i>Betula</i>  <i>lenta</i>),  Black
Gum  (<i>Nyssa  sylvatica</i>),  Sassafras  (<i>Sassafras  albidum</i>
), Pitch Pine  (<i>Pinus  rigida</i>),  White Pine  (<i>Pinus 
srrobus</i>)  and scattered Cucumber Magnolia  (<i>Magnolia 
acuminata</i>).   Serviceberry  (likely<i> Amelanchier arborea</i>), 
Flowering Dogwood  (<i>Cornus</i>  <i>florida</i>),  Striped Maple (
<i>Acer  pensylvanicum</i>)  and American Chestnut (<i> Castanea
dentata </i>) sprouts form an understory.  Witch Hazel (<i> Hamamelis
virginiana </i>) and Smooth Alder  (<i>Alnus serrulata</i>)  are
concentrated along streams and in moist areas and there are also a
few scattered Wild Raisin (<i>Viburnum cassinoides</i>) bushes. 
Mountain Laurel  (<i>Kalmia  latifolia</i>),  Minnie-bush (<i>
Menziesia pilosa </i>), Black Huckleberry   (<i>Gaylussacia baccata 
</i>) and Upland Low Blueberry  (<i> Vaccinium pallidum</i>)  form a
heavy shrub layer on the upland with smaller amounts of Bear Oak (<i>
Quercus ilicifolia </i>).  There also is a little Wild Rose (<i>Rosa
carolina</i>).  Moist areas have vigorous vines of common Greenbrier
(<i> Smilax rotundifolia </i>), a  ground cover of Ground Berry 
(<i>Rubus hispidus</i>) ,  and in openings, Narrow-leaved Sundrops
(<i>Oenothera fruticosa</i>), Wrinkled-leaf Goldenrod  (<i>Solidago
rugosa</i>)   and other goldenrods.</p>
<p>	Teaberry  (<i>Gaultheria procumbens </i>)
and Trailing Arbutus  (<i>Epigaea repens </i>) are abundant in dry
acid-soil areas, and where these are in the open, Wild Indigo (
<i>Baptisia tinctoria) </i>,  Cow wheat  (<i>Melanpyrum lineare)</i>,
 Mountain Bellwort  (<i>Uvularia pudica)  , </i>Wood Tickseed  (
<i>Coreopsis major)    </i>and Whorled Loosestrife   (<i>Lysimachia
quadrifolia  </i>) are found.  Of particular interest is the
abundance of Wild Sarsaparilla (<i> Aralia nudicaulis </i>) which is
usually dependent on cold air drainage at these elevations.</p>
<p>	These flowering plants are accompanied
by at least five species of ferns &mdash;Bracken (<i> Pteridium
aqilinum </i>),  Hay -scented (<i> Dennstaedtia punctilobula </i>),
New York (<i> Thelypteris noveboracensis </i>), Christmas (<i>
Polystichum acrostichoides </i>) and Cinnamon  (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>
)&mdash; and two of lycopods, <i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>  and <i>L.
obscurum</i>.</p>
<p>	About a quarter mile (0.4 km) upstream
from the bench mark overflow forms a wetland along Muddy Run. 
Consisting mostly of a Smooth Alder Swamp, this wetland may have
resulted from Beaver  (<i>Castor  canadensis </i>)  action.  A Gray
Catbird   (Dumetella  <i>carolinensis </i>)   called from the alder
thickets but no direct evidence of Beavers was seen.</p>
<p>	The northwest slope of Warm Springs Mountain is
marked by a series of narrow ravines with intermittent or seasonal
water flows.  Beginning at the benchmark a traverse was made up the
slope along a trail on the southwest side of a ravine here.  After
noting an increase in Chestnut Oak, Bear Oak  and Pitch Pine upward,
and at about a third of a mile (0.5 km) above the benchmark, the
trail was abandoned for a climb up the spur to the southwest.  A
survey was then made of a deep ravine on the other side of this spur,
here at an elevation of perhaps 2700 ft. (820 meters) asl.</p>
<p>	Trees next to a small stream with
flowing water in this ravine are Canada Hemlock  (Tsuga  canadensis
), possibly Adelgid-free, Chestnut Oak, Black Gum, White Oak, Black
Birch and Red Maple, all large and seemingly qualifying as old
growth.  Striped Maple is present and Witch Hazel and Mountain Laurel
form a shrub layer.  A sparse ground cover consists of Starflower (
<i>Trientalis borealis</i>),  Canada Mayflower  (<i>Maianthemum
canadense</i>),  Indian Cucumber Root (<i> Medeola virginiana </i>),
Mountain Aster  (<i>Aster acuminatus</i>),  Round-leaf Violet (<i>Viola
rotundifolia</i>)   and New York and Cinnamon Fern.  There is also a
variety of mosses, including Cushion (<i>Leucobryum</i> sp.) and 
Delicate Fern (<i>Thuidium</i> <i>delicatulum</i>.) and the liverwort
<i>Bazzania trilobata</i>, a familiar of spruce forests.  The
presence of so many northern/cool-climate species probably signals
significant cold air drainage and accumulation from the heights above
during the early growing season.  The northwest aspect and depth of
this ravine also favor a cool microclimate here.</p>
<p>	On the return route to the road and
following the stream down-slope, Hemlock drops out and White Pine
appears with Teaberry and spotted Wintergreen   (<i>Chimaphila 
maculata </i>) in dry, and<i> Rubus hispidus</i>  in moist, areas. 
In one place Rock Fern (<i>Polypodium virginianum</i>) and a variety
of mosses, including <i>Dicranum</i> sp. cover a large block of
sandstone in a decorative display.</p>
<p>	The next traverse was initiated on the
bank of Muddy Run about a mile southwest of the benchmark, along Rt.
614, where the stream and road bend sharply to the west.  The
elevation at this point is about 2200 ft. (670 meters) asl.  A spot
inventory on the stream bank disclosed a rich mesic forest in which
White Basswood  (<i>Tilia  heterophylla</i>),  Tuliptree (
<i>Liriodendron  tulipifera</i>),  Black Birch, Pignut Hickory <i>(
Carya  glabra</i> or <i>C.  ovalis</i>)  and Flowering Dogwood are
prominent.  A very incomplete list of herbs included Hog Peanut (<i>
Amphicarpa</i> <i>bracteata </i>), Horse Balm (<i> Collinsonia
canadensis</i>),  Meadow Rue (<i> Thalictrum </i>sp),  Tall
Coneflower  (<i>Rudbeckia lacinata</i>) ,   abundant Wild
Sarsaparilla and beautifully blooming Blue Monkshood  (<i>Aconitum 
uncinatum</i>). </p>
<p>	From Muddy Run an old woods road
ascends Warm Springs Mountain along the SW side of a deep ravine. 
The bed of this road is overgrown with mosses, lichens and various
herbs and in general mesic conditions persist upward along it.  White
Oak, White Ash  (<i>Fraxinus  americana</i>),  Shagbark Hickory  (
<i>Carya  ovata</i>),  Tuliptree,  Black and Northern Red Oak, Black
Birch, Red Maple and a little Sugar Maple  ( <i>Acer  saccharum</i>) 
form a canopy with outstandingly large and well-formed Pignut
Hickories.  Striped Maple, Witch Hazel, Great Rhododendron
(<i>Rhododendron maximum)   </i>and Mtn. Laurel are concentrated on
the lower slope and along the road, and here and there are Virginia
Creeper  (<i>Parthenocissus  quinquefolia</i>)  and Poison Ivy  (<i>Rhus
 radicans</i>)  vines.  Represented among the herb layer are Indian
Tobacco (<i> Lobelia</i> <i>inflata</i>),  Hairy Disporum (<i>Disporum
lanuginosum) </i>, White Grass  (<i>Leersia virginica </i>), Hog
Peanut, Indian Cucumber Root, Blue Cohosh  (<i>Caulophyllum
thlictroides</i>),  Four-leaved Yam(<i> Dioscorea quaternata </i>)
and Wild Sarsaparilla.  Water Pennywort (<i>Hydrocotyle americana</i>)
and Bugleweed  (<i> Lycopus  </i>sp)  occupy seeps and moist areas
while in dryer, acid-soil areas Moccasin Flower  (<i>Cypripedium
acaule </i>), Rattlesnake Plantain (<i> Goodyera pubescens </i>) and
Shining Clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium lucidulum</i>) spring from banks
under overhanging Laurel.  A few moist shady places harbor small
patches of Partridge Berry  (<i> Mitchella repens </i>)and,
characteristic of this forest type, Christmas, Hay-scented and
Marginal Shield(<i> Dryopteris marginalis </i>) Ferns.</p>
<p>	After perhaps 1/3 mile (0.5 km) the
woods road was left behind in a steep climb up the spur to the
southwest.  Not far above the woods road the slope is interrupted by
a concavity with a moist, seepy floor covered by mesic and hydric
herbs.  These included Jewelweed (<i> Impatiens</i>  sp)  Sensitive
Fern (<i> Onoclea sensibilis</i>),  Broad Beech Fern (<i>Phegopteris
hexagonoptera</i>) and New York Fern as well as grasses and sedges.</p>
<p>	The entire area of the slope and spur top, here at
perhaps 2600 ft. (790 meters) asl is occupied by a very open forest
of Black, Northern, Red, Chestnut and White Oaks, Tuliptree, Pignut
Hickory, Black Birch and White Pine.  Small amounts of Flowering
Dogwood forms an understory while Wild Sarsaparilla, Rattlesnake
Plantain and Christmas Fern are among the few herbs present.</p>
<p>	A significant observation during departure from the
area in the evening was a strong cool breeze blowing down the ravine.
 It may be that this air motion and cooling supports the Wild
Sarsaparilla and perhaps other northern species on these slopes.</p>
<p>	The clearly more mesic character of the forest on
these slopes as compared with that traversed above the bench mark may
be significant in terms of underlying rock types.  Certainly the
former lie a mile (1.6 km) closer to and may even border on the
region of Ordovician rocks discussed earlier.  In any case this
forest seems to form a transitional type between the dry ericaceous
forests associated with silica-rich rocks of the region and the rich
mesic type to be discussed in the next section.</p>
 </ul>
<h2>Route 39 Crossing of Warm Springs
Mountain</h2>
<p><b>Source Walk: 9-4-95 and other observations</b></p>
<ul>
<p>	On ascent of Warm Springs Mountain from the
southeast via Route 39 the impression is one of a dry, dominantly oak
forest similar to the prevailing regional type.  Mesic species, and
particularly those such as grape vines, are not much in evidence. 
However at the mountain crest, here at 2950 ft. (900 meters) in a
small wind gap, this changes as a variety of mesic species suddenly
come into view.  Beyond the crest the highway descends in switch
backs to the Warm Springs Valley through a rich, although degraded,
mixed mesophyte forest of a type usually associated with carbonate
rocks.</p>
<p>	Canopy species noted in the gap include
White Ash, Black Walnut  (<i>Juglans  nigra</i>),  Red and Sugar
Maple, Black Cherry   (<i>Prunus  serotina</i>),  Black Locust (
<i>Robinia  pseudoacacia</i>)   and a basswood approximating <i>Tilia
heterophylla</i>.  Tuliptree occurs at an unusual elevation of 2900
ft. (880 meters) on the SE side of the gap but is little in evidence
along the road except near the bottom of the NW slope.  Summer Grape
(<i>Vitis &aelig;stivalis</i>) is common and lush in the gap and on
the NW slope as is also a bittersweet (<i>Celastrus</i>  sp)  vine,
tentatively identified as the alien <i>C. orbiculatus</i>.</p>
<p>	Other canopy species observed along the
descent to the Warm Springs Valley, in addition to those already
mentioned, are Slippery Elm  (<i>Ulmus rubra</i>),  Northern Red and
White Oaks, Black Birch, Shagbark, Pignut and Bitternut  (<i>Carya 
cordiformis</i>)  Hickories, Butternut  (<i>Juglans cinerea </i>),
Black Maple  (<i>Acer nigrum </i>), Cucumber Magnolia and Red
Mulberry  (<i>Morus rubra </i>).  Small trees and shrubs include
Hophornbeam   (<i>Ostrya  virginiana</i>) ,  Black Elderberry (<i>
Sambucus canadensis </i>), Witch Hazel, Maple-leaf Viburnum  (
<i>Viburnum  acerifolium</i>)   and Flowering Raspberry   ( <i>Rubus 
odoratus</i>) .   Winter Grape (<i>Vitis vulpina</i>) vines join
those of Summer Grape.  The greatest contrast, in fact, between the
SE and NW sides of the Mountain is in the abundant grape vines which
climb high up trees and sprawl over undergrowth on the latter but are
sparse on the former.  In addition there is a virtual or total
absence of ericaceous vegetation in the roadside forest of the NW
slope.</p>
<p>	No attempt was made to inventory herbaceous species,
which in any case were sparse due to the season and the degraded
character of the forest.  However the presence of such canopy species
as Black Walnut, Black Maple, Red Mulberry,  and to a lesser degree
Slippery Elm, characterizes a forest far different from the acid-soil
mesic forests of coves and riparian zones so typical of these
mountains.  The demanding canopy species present  here seem to
indicate considerably richer soils than those that nourish even the
most mesic forests along Muddy Run.  While attributing forest type to
bedrock type is difficult, such a relationship seems plausible in
this case because the NW aspect is a relatively constant factor and
mapped geologic formation boundaries and rock types occur in the
right places.</p>

<h2>Dolly Ann Hollow</h2>
<b>Source Walk:  5-2-93</b>
<ul>
<p>	Northeast of Covington Warm Springs Mountain ends in
a rugged highland around 4072 ft. (1241 meter) prominence of Big
Knob.  To the southeast of this knob the terrain drops off in Dolly
Ann Hollow, one of several stream valleys that radiate from the
upland.  In terms of the geologic structure the Warm Springs
anticline pitches beneath younger Devonian sediments here and is
closed with respect to the Silurian sandstones, which, as a result,
dominate the area.</p>
<p>	Dolly Ann Hollow is representative of acid-mesic
riparian zones in siliceous country rocks.  Fortunately the riparian
zone has escaped some of the worst logging onslaughts and a beautiful
stand of old growth forest has been preserved.  This forest is
dominated by impressively large Hemlock, White Pine, White and
Chestnut Oaks and Pignut Hickory as well as somewhat smaller Black
Gum, Northern Red Oak, Tuliptree, Red Maple, Basswood and Shagbark
Hickory.  However little White Ash and no Sugar Maple were seen. 
Scattered Serviceberry and thickets of Witch Hazel and Great
Rhododendron form an understory and shrub layer, especially near the
stream.  Abundant large woody debris in the stream and elsewhere
define old growth conditions and lend a wild character to the hollow.</p>
<p>	No Striped Maple was seen, but this was probably
fortuitous, since, although the elevation of near 2000 feet  (610 m) 
asl, is low for the species, it might be expected as a result of the
accumulation of cool subsiding air.</p>
<p>	No systematic inventory of herbaceous
species was undertaken.  However an unexpectedly sparse number of
herbs was noted in the riparian zone perhaps as a consequence of the
deep shade of Hemlock and Rhododendron or lack of suitable nutrients.
 Partridge Berry is, as usual, present under Hemlock and a number of
lily-family members &mdash; <i>Medeola</i>, <i>Uvularia</i>,
<i>Smilacina</i>  &mdash;as well as <i>Dioscorea</i>  and <i>Anemone</i>
were observed putting forth new growth.  One Large-flowered Trillium
(<i>Trillium grandiflorum</i>) was observed in bloom near the stream.
 Wild Sarsaparilla with flowers developing was fairly abundant a half
mile (0.8 km) upstream from the road.</p>
<p>	Surprisingly also for the season, few
warblers or other birds were seen or heard in the treetops, although
Pileated <i> (Dryocopus</i>  <i>pileatus </i>)  Woodpeckers and Blue
Jays  ( <i>Cyanocitta  cristata</i> )   were in evidence.  No visible
life was noted in the stream but some sign of Beavers was seen.  Acid
levels may be high in these waters because of siliceous rocks in the
watershed.</p>
<p>	A rapid reconnaissance of the upland in
the vicinity of Big Knob was also done.  The forest on this upland is
very dry and ericaceous with stunted Black, Scarlet and Chestnut
Oaks, Red Maple and Black Gum at low to moderate elevations and
Northern Red Oak and abundant Striped Maple near the summit. 
Serviceberry in full bloom was conspicuous as were Mountain Laurel
and Black Huckleberry  (<i>Gaylussacia baccata </i>) in the shrub
layer.  Although much of the stunted and depauperate character of the
upland forest probably relates to past land abuse and recent
clearcutting it is also ultimately a result of nutrient-poor soils
inherent in the siliceous bedrock.</p>
 </ul>
<h2>Smith Creek Watershed</h2>
<p><b>Source Walk: 4-16-95</b></p>
<ul>
<p>	The Smith Creek watershed includes part of the
southeast slope of Warm Springs Mountain just northeast of Dolly Ann
Hollow.  The country rock is dominantly Silurian sandstones and other
silica-rich rocks.</p>
<p>	The first spot inventory of forest was
done on the main stem of Smith Creek just below where Piney Branch
enters McGraw Gap at about 1600 ft. (490 meters) asl.  Trees in the
riparian zone of the steep-sided gap are Adelgid-infested Hemlock,
Tuliptree, Black Locust, Black Birch, Black, Scarlet, Northern Red,
Chestnut and White Oaks, Basswood (Possibly <i>Tilia heterophylla</i>),
Cucumber Magnolia, Red Maple, White Ash, Black Gum, White Pine and
Flowering Dogwood.  Only one small Striped Maple was seen.  Great
Rhododendron, Mtn. Laurel, Witch Hazel, Wild Hydrangea   (<i>Hydrangea
arborescens </i>) <i>  </i>and Black Raspberry (<i> Rubus
occidentalis</i>)  form the general shrub layer with Smooth Alder
along the stream.  What appeared to be Hardhack (<i>Spirea tomentosa</i>)
was found growing in a part of the stream bed which was then dry.</p>
<p>	The most diverse herb assemblage occurs
on the southwest bank where the aspect is almost north and where
there appears to be colluvial enrichment of the soil.  It is also
possible that more nutrient-rich rocks than average for the area
occur here.  Happily also on this day many species were in full
bloom.  Among  these were Wild Geranium, Large-flowered Trillium,
Golden Ragwort, Wild Ginger (<i>Asarum canadense</i>), Cut-leaf
Toothwort (<i>Dentaria lacinata</i>), Great
Chickweed(<i>Stellaria pubera</i>), a White Violet, Bloodroot (<i>
Sanguinaria canadensis </i>), Rue Anemone (<i> Anemonella
thalictroides </i>), and the sedges <i>Carex plantaginea</i>  and <i>C.
torta</i>, the last in the stream bed.  Others not in bloom at the
time were White Wood Aster,  a jewelweed, Trout Lily  (probably<i>
Erythronium umbilicatum </i>), Jack-in-the-Pulpit (<i> Arisaema
triphyllum</i>),  Black Cohosh (<i> Cimicifuga racemosa </i>) and
Bellwort  (<i>Uvularia </i>sp).   These were accompanied by
Christmas, Marginal Shield and Rock   (<i>Polypodium virginianum </i>)
Ferns and in the stream bed by the alien Mouse-ear Chickweed
(<i>Cerastium vicosum</i>) looking like it should be native!</p>
<p>	Yellow Tiger Swallowtail
Butterflies, a small elegant Sphinx Moth and a type of gnat were
among the insects seen.</p>
<p>	As might be expected from the
low elevation and the open character of the valley, no plants of
truly northern affinity were found.  In this way the area contrasts
slightly with Dolly Ann Hollow where at least one such species, Wild
Sarsaparilla, occurs.</p>
<p>	The junction of
Route 606 and FR 125 on the lower slope of Warm Springs Mtn. is at
about 2000 ft. (610 meters) elevation.  Canopy species here in
approximate order of abundance are Scarlet, Black, Chestnut and White
Oaks, Sassafras, Black Gum, Red Maple, Pitch Pine and scattered
Hemlock.  The forest is quite open with sparse understory and shrub
layers, the former of Flowering Dogwood, Serviceberry and Striped
Maple, the latter of Mountain Laurel, Deerberry  (<i>Vaccinium 
stamineum </i>),  Upland Low Blueberry and Black Huckleberry.  A few
trees are draped by grape vines.  The leaf mat is heavy, with few
herbs, but scattered Teaberry,  Rattlesnake Plantain  (<i>Goodyera 
pubescens</i>) ,  Spotted Wintergreen  and Halbert-leaved Violet
(<i>Viola hastata</i>), the latter made conspicuous by bright yellow
blooms.  Cushion, other mosses and <i>Cladonia</i>  lichen are
concentrated in moist areas and at the bases of trees, which is also
habitat for Poverty  Oat Grass (<i>Danthonia spicata</i>).</p>
<p>	Many trees here have well-healed fire scars,
particularly on the up-slope side of the trunk.  If burning is
regarded as concentrated on the lee side, an up-slope wind at the
time of burning is indicated.</p>
<p>	Downslope from the road junction White
Oak increases and is joined by Pignut, Tuliptree, Black Birch and
Black Locust.  Hairy Angelica (<i>Angelica venenosa</i>) becomes
common and in places there are a few stunted Wild Geranium, Partridge
Berry and  Sweet-scented Bedstraw   (<i>Galium triflorum</i>) .  
Unidentified sedges, rushes and a blue violet cluster at small seeps.</p>
<p>	A rapid reconnaissance along FR 125 to
the NE added Big-toothed Aspen   (<i>Populus  grandidentata</i>) , 
Witch Hazel and &mdash;along a small water course with Teaberry&mdash;
Trailing Arbutus and Galax (<i> Galax aphylla</i>)  to the tally of
plants.  Another species prominent on the road bank was
Plantain-leaved Pussytoes (<i>Antennaria plantaginifolia</i>) here
associated with a soil profile that showed a bleached zone beneath a
thin organic (mor) surface layer, an indication of podzolic
conditions.</p>
<p>	A little beyond this point a short
traverse was made downslope noting Rattlesnake Weed  (<i>Hieracium
venosum)    </i>on the way to a small wetland and the site of an
artificial pond constructed by the Forest Service.  Growing over the
berm of this pond &mdash;which contained Eastern Newts   (
<i>Notophthalmus  viridescens</i>)  &mdash; was a lush growth of
<i>Lycopodium flabelliforme</i>.  Farther downslope, in an active
seep overgrown by grass and sedges, overturned rocks exposed what
appeared to be Dusky (<i>Desmognathus</i>) and Two-lined (<i>Eurycea</i>)
salamanders.  Here also the first Red-eyed Vireo   ( <i>Vireo 
olivaceus</i>)   calls of the season were heard.</p>
<p>	On the return loop to the road a single quite
large Sugar Maple was encountered.  This tree, as is usual in these
mountains, where the species is not common, stood out by virtue of
its fungus-blackened trunk, a result of sap leaking from multiple
Yellow-bellied Sapsucker  ( <i>Sphyrapicus  varius</i> )   borings
that ringed it.</p>
<p>	Finally, advantage was taken of the return drive
from the field to note the character of forest along the upper Smith
Creek and Wilson Creek Valleys.  As expected from the underlying
rocks the upland forest here is dry and ericaceous while riparian
zones are acid-mesic with Great Rhododendron prominent in moist
areas.  Tuliptree and Red Maple appear to be dominant in many
regenerating clearcuts and other logging openings which mar the
forest along the road.  But contrasting hopefully with these is the
towering bulk of Warm Springs Mountain rising to the hidden summit we
consider in the next section.</p>
 </ul>
<h2>Bald Knob</h2>
<p><b>Source Walk: 8-28-95</b></p>
<ul>
<p>	Central Appalachian ridges seldom
exceed 4000 ft (1220 meters) in elevation for any great distance and
higher elevations tend to be isolated &ldquo;knobs&rdquo; that stand
above the main ridge.  Examples from the Shenandoah Range have been
discussed.  Because of exposure to wind and sunlight on these knobs,
growing conditions and the general environment of biologic
communities are likely to be more severe than might be expected from
elevation alone.  At 4225 ft (1288 meters) asl Bald Knob, the highest
point of Warm Springs Mountain, is not unusually lofty.  However the
refractory nature of its Silurian sandstone bedrock and isolation
from other high elevation ridges expose it to an unusual poverty of
soil moisture and nutrients and to drying and freezing wind blasts
not attained on some higher peaks.  In recognition of Bald Knob&rsquo;s
unusual conditions and biological communities Virginia&rsquo;s
Division of Natural Heritage   ( Smith, 1991)  has proposed that it
be designated a &ldquo;Special Interest Area&mdash;Botanical.&rdquo; 
Among featured rare species are the Variable Sedge (<i>Carex 
polymorpha</i>) and the Smooth Green Snake, with the latter also
occurring on Shenandoah Mountain. According to Fleming et al  (2001) 
the globally - rare Herodias Underwing Moth  (<i>Catocala  herodias 
gerhardii</i>)   has been documented as present in the pine barrens
here.</p>
<p>	The Blad Knob Summit is (unfortunately) conveniently
approached from State Route 703 via a road that gives access to an
electronic site there.  The elevation at the junction of the two
roads at the knob&rsquo;s base is 3898 ft (1188 meters) which give it
a height of 327 ft (100 meters) above the ridge.</p>
<p>	The general area of the road junction and the slope
leading to the summit is dominated by pine heath with stunted
Northern Red Oak forest at the margins.  This vegetation is developed
on coarse, light gray sandstone or quartzite which through the
millennia has weathered into a jumble of large and small angular
blocks.  It is likely that much of this weathering dates to
conditions during the ice age.</p>
<p>	A spot inventory at the junction began
with a curiosity, a single Tuliptree sapling, here far above the
species&rsquo; normal range.  Very likely the tree is a product of
the fortuitous sprouting and survival from a seed lofted by the wind
from mesic forests on the lower northwest slope.  Other trees here
are Northern Red Oak, Black Birch, Black Locust, Fire Cherry  (<i>
Prunus pensylvanica </i>), Striped Maple, Pitch Pine and Mountain Ash
 (<i>Pyrus americana</i>).   The heath vegetation is dominated by
Catawba Rhododendron (<i> Rhododendron catawbiense </i>), in contrast
with the Valley below in which Great Rhododendron holds sway. 
Catawba Rhododendron, which is a rock lover, is here accompanied by
Mountain Laurel, Minnie-bush,  Black Chokeberry (<i> Aronia
melanocarpa</i>),  Bear Oak,  Sweet Fern  (<i>Comptonia peregrina </i>)
and several species of blueberries, including Early Low  (<i>Vaccinium
 angustifolium</i>)   and  Upland Low <i>. </i>Stunted and wind
distorted Pitch Pines punctuate the low shrub, while Teaberry,
Trailing Arbutus and Spotted Wintergreen form a ground cover.</p>
<p>	Within the oak forest Witch Hazel seems
to thrive particularly well, forming stout clumps under and among
Northern Red Oak.  In openings, as along the road, there are
scattered stunted Sassafras, which extend to the summit, American
Chestnut sprouts, Blackberry shrubs and various grasses including
Little Bluestem (<i>Andropogon scoparius</i>).</p>
<p>	Broadleaf herbs include various
goldenrods among which is <i>Solidago curtisii </i> White Snakeroot,
Whorled Loosestrife, Southern Bellflower (<i> Campanula divaricata </i>)
and Bracken Fern.  Farther along the summit road these are joined by
Plume Lily (<i> Smilacina racemosa </i>), Bigleaf Aster (<i> Aster
macrophyllus </i>), Panicled Hawkweed (<i> Hieracium paniculatum </i>)
Gall-of-the-Earth (<i>Prenanthes serpentaria</i>) and   Cow Wheat
(<i>Melampyrum lineare)  </i>.  More unusual than any of these is
Wild Lily-of-the-Valley (<i>Convalaria montana</i>), an Appalachian
high elevation member of the lily family frequently associated with
boreal species.  Although some regard this plant as a feral version
of the domesticated Lily-of-the-Valley, <i>C. majalis</i>, it has
distinct characteristics and is almost certainly native (Strausbaugh
and Core, 1977).</p>
<p>	Perhaps half way to the summit Mountain
Aster appears, and a little higher, Wild Sarsaparilla.  Here also are
the last few shrubby sprouts of Black Oak and  also of White Oak, 
species that seldom reach 4000 ft. (1220 meters) asl at this
latitude.  Other species successively encountered on the approach to
the summit were Bowman&rsquo;s Root (<i>Gillenia trifoliata</i>),
Smooth Gooseberry (<i>Ribes rotundifolium</i>), Black Cherry, Black
Huckleberry, Hazelnut  ( <i>Corylus</i>  sp.)   of an undetermined
species, Red Maple, Wild Raisin, Hay-scented Fern, Maple-leaf
Viburnum, Serviceberry, Spreading Dogbane (<i> Apocynum
androsaemifolium</i>), Virginia Creeper, Common Greenbrier, Wild
Lettuce (<i>Lactuca canadensis</i>) and Upland Willow (<i>Salix
humilis</i>).</p>
<p>	At the summit much of the low heath
vegetation that prevails on the southwest slope is replaced by a
dwarf forest.  A spot inventory shows this forest to be dominated by
Northern Red Oak with abundant Mountain Ash (now covered with
clusters of brilliant red fruit), a few Yellow Birch, Striped Maple
and at least one grove of Beech  ( <i>Fagus  grandifolia</i>) .  
Interspersed with these trees are Bear Oak, Witch Hazel,  Mountain
Holly (<i>Ilex montana) </i>, Minnie-bush, Wild Raisin, Catawba
Rhododendron, Mountain Laurel, Maleberry  (<i>Lyonia ligustrina </i>)
and a little Azalea (perhaps <i>Rhododendron roseum</i>).  Black
Berries and large vigorous Hairy Angelica grow in openings.</p>
<p>	In the forest beneath the stunted oaks
ground cover consists largely of various mosses and lichens growing
on quartzite blocks, and between these, Teaberry and Hay-scented
Fern.  In some places there are patches of inter-grown Canada
Mayflower, Mountain Aster, Wild Lily-of-the-Valley and Wild
Sarsaparilla or dark green clumps of crinkled Hair Grass  (<i>
Deschampsia  flexuosa </i>) with dried seed stalks still present. 
Beyond the summit, on the gentle northeast slope, much of the ground
cover consists of Rock Fern which grows thickly on the quartzite
blocks.  Other plants noted along the road here were Virgin&rsquo;s
Bower (<i>Clematis virginiana</i>), Moccasin Flower,  increased
quantities of Black Huckleberry,  blueberries, a single White Pine
and a lone Virginia Pine  (<i>Pinus  virginiana</i>)   seedling.</p>
<p>	Many of the plants on Bald Knob such as the heaths,
Bear Oak and Pitch Pine are associated with the dryest, most
nutrient-poor soils and the harshest wind conditions.  Others, such
as Mountain Ash, Canada Mayflower, Mountain Aster, Wild Sarsaparilla,
and Ilex montana respond to cold, but moister conditions.  Thus the
heaths, Bear Oak and Pitch Pine are concentrated on the southwest
slope while the other group is associated with the Red Oak forest on
the summit and on sheltered slopes.</p>
<p>	The erosion-resistant sandstone and quartzite
bedrock exposed on Bald Knob is probably very similar to rock which
underlies much of the southeast side of Warm Springs Mountain as well
as its northeast and southwest termini where the anticline closes. 
However the lower the elevation, the greater the covering soil layer
as a result of colluvial soil-forming processes.  Yet although
growing conditions on bare rocks of the Bald Knob summit are greatly
moderated at lower elevations they seldom attain optimum conditions
except where the anticline is breached to expose more nutrient-rich
rocks.</p>
