<h2>War Spur, Mountain Lake Wilderness</h2>
<br>December 1999
<p><b>Source walks: 6-4-92, 9-23-96 and 9-24-96</b>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<p> War Spur is a northeast-trending
spur of Salt Pond Mountain within the Mountain Lake Wilderness of the Jefferson
National Forest. It lies 2.5 miles (4
km) south of the White Rocks Campground. 
Access to the area is via Route 613 from the southeast along the Doe
Creek Valley. This valley ascends
through an elevation range of 2000 ft (610 meters) and terminates very near
Mountain Lake, one of only two natural lakes in Virginia. Curiously however, this lake drains north
into Little Stony Creek (see <a href=giles.htm>our section on Little Stony Creek</a>). Rich mixed mesophyte forest characterizes
the lower valley. Trees here include
but are not limited to Tuliptree, Cucumbertree, Sugar and Red Maples, Yellow
Buckeye, Shagbark Hickory, Northern Red Oak, Black Walnut, White Ash, White and
American Basswoods and Sycamore. At
higher elevations this forest gives way to one in which Northern Red Oak
dominates the upland and Canada Hemlock (<i>Tsuga
canadensis </i> ) and Red Spruce (<i>Picea 
rubens</i>) occupy the hollows. 
While in part a result of elevation, this change in forest type is also
related to the presence of Ordovician limestones in the lower Valley and
Silurian and Devonian Sandstones at the highest elevations.
<p> Northeast of Mountain Lake and
skirting the western edge of the Wilderness, Rt. 613 passes through typical
high elevation forest of squat-formed and thick-trunked Northern Red and White
Oak with a dense ground cover of Cinnamon Fern (<i>Osmunda cinnamomea).</i> The
Country rock on much of this plateau-like upland appears to be Silurian Keefer
Sandstone whose austere flags, angular boulders and outcrops everywhere erupt
from the forest floor.
<p> Inventories done in this area on
6-4-92 were cursory but those of 1996 were more extensive. Our arrival at the war Spur trailhead on the
afternoon of 9-23-96 allowed time for an inventory of the upland forest and a
brief survey of the old growth hemlock-spruce forest along the upper War Spur
Branch of Johns Creek, a part of the James system to the northeast. The inventory extended along the “Chestnut
Trail,” which forms a loop with the War Spur Trail at elevations ranging from
3750 ft (1140 meters) on War Spur itself to 3550 ft (1080 meters) along war
Spur Branch.
<p> The upland forest along War Spur is
mostly mature, although young in places, reflecting differences in logging
history. The canopy is dominated by
squat, thick-trunked Northern Red Oak with lesser amounts of White, Chestnut
and Black Oaks. The ratio of Northern
Red to Chestnut Oak appears to be about ten to one. Dominance by these oaks is shared with Cucumbertree (<i>Magnolia 
acuminata</i>) , Red Maple, Black Gum, Sassafras, Pignut Hickories
(including some identified as <i>Carya
glabra </i> ) and small amounts of Black
Cherry, Hemlock, Black Birch and White Pine. 
The Black Cherry has the usual poor form that distinguishes the growth
habit of this species in the Valley and Ridge from that in the
Alleghenies. American Chestnut (<i>Castnaea dentata</i>) sprouts are very abundant and
form an understory with Striped Maple, Mountain Holly (<i>Ilex montana </i> ) and Serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier</i> ) of undetermined species. Shrubs include Mountain Laurel (<i>Kalmia 
latifoli</i>a ), Minnie-bush (<i>Menziesia pilosa 
</i>), Southern Mountain Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium erythrocarpum</i>) , Thornless Blackberry (<i>Rubus 
canadensis </i>) , Wild Raisin (<i>Viburnum 
cassinoides </i>) , Upland Low
Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium pallidum</i> or <i>V. vacillans </i>) , Flame Azalea (<i>Rhododendron 
canlendulaceum </i>) and Pinxter
Azalea (<i>R. nudiflorum </i>) . Flame and Pinxter Azaleas had been observed
in bloom on our June 1992 visit. It is
interesting also that the fruit of the Southern Mountain Cranberry is almost
black in color here as distinguished from the bright red berries usually
observed by us in the Alleghenies, although this may be a widespread
variant. Ground Berry (<i>Rubus 
hispidus </i>) occurs as ground
cover in moister areas. Macrolichens
were abundant on tree trunks.
<p> Herbs and various low plants
included New York Fern (<i>Thelypteris noveboracensis </i>) , Cinnamon Fern, Hay-scented Fern (<i>Dennstædtia punctilobula </i>) and Bracken Fern (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) in
order of abundance, Mountain Aster (<i>Aster acuminatus )</i>, Fly Poison (<i>Amianthium 
muscatoxicum </i>) , Teaberry (<i>Gaultheria 
procumbens </i>) , Trailing
Arbutus (<i>Epigæa repens </i>) , Yellow
Clintonia (<i>Clintonia borealis</i>) , Curtis Goldenrod (<i>Solidago 
curtisii</i> ), Blue Monkshood (<i>Aconitum 
uncinatum </i>) , Variable Panic
Grass (<i>Panicum commutatum </i>) , Wild
Sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis 
</i>), Four-leaved Yam (<i>Dioscorea quaternata 
</i>), Soapwort Gentian (<i>Gentiana saponaria 
</i>) then in bloom, Lovage (<i>
Ligusticum canadense </i>) , Wild Lily of the Valley (<i>Convallaria 
montana </i>) , Southern
Bellflower (<i>Campanula divaricata 
</i>), Windswept Moss (<i>Dicranum 
scoparium </i>) , Downy
Rattlesnake Plantain (<i>Goodyera pubescens 
</i>), Indian Cucumber-root (<i>Medeola virginiana 
</i>), a large Stinkhorn (phallus type) fungus, Sweet White Violet (<i>Viola 
blanda </i>) , the Panic grass <i>Panicum boscii</i> and Smooth Forked Chickweed (<i>Paronychia canadensis 
</i>). In one place along the
trail we were attracted by a large clump of Slender-flowered Muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia tenuiflora </i>) and
nearby,tufts of its congener, Nimblewill (<i>M.
schreberi </i>) . Not far beyond, Autumn
Bent (<i>Agrostis perennans </i>) and
Calico Aster (<i>Aster lateriflorus </i>) were added to our tally. 
Fire Pink (<i>Silene virginica 
</i>), although not noticed on
this traverse, was observed in spectacular bloom on our June, 1992 visit. One further addition was the tall brome grass
<i>Bromus latiglumis</i> ,which formed a few
conspicuous clumps at the forest edge near the road.
<p> As sometimes happens, the dry, acid
environment in these mountains is locally relaxed in a seep or enclave of
better soil. This appeared to be the
case as we neared the farthest reach of the upland traverse. Here we encountered a small community consisting
of Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga racemosa 
</i>), Dotted St. Johns-wort (<i>Hypericum
punctatum </i>) , Purple Bedstraw (<i>Galium 
atifolium </i>) , Hairy Disporum
(<i>Disporum l anuginosum </i>) and American Spikenard (<i>Aralia 
racemosa </i>) , all stunted in
appearance however.
<p> Not far beyond this point the trail
turns sharply left and descends into the ravine. Here Mountain Laurel increases greatly in abundance, Great
Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron maximum 
</i>) appears, with the Hemlock-Spruce forest just beyond. Description of the latter will however be
reserved for the next section.
<p> After a night of listening to the
intermittent patter of rain and Barred Owls (<i>Strix</i> <i>varia</i>) we awoke to the conversation of Ravens (<i>Corvus 
corax</i>) . Because more rain
threatened, we made a decision to forego a trip to more distant Mann’s Bog for
an inventory of War Spur Hemlock-Spruce forest. On this foray we took the north loop of the trail. Although the upland forest along this trail
is much like that along the Chestnut Trail, a few new species were
recorded. These included fairly
abundant Round-leaf Pyrola (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia </i>) , a single anemic-looking Stiff Aster (<i>Aster linariifolius </i>) , a species which seems more at home at
lower elevations, Wood Tickseed (<i>Coreopsis major</i>) , the sedge <i>Carex swanii</i>, Slender Goldenrod (<i>Solidago erecta </i>) and an alien Fescue (<i>Festuca</i> sp.) in conspicuous dark green clumps of filamentous
leaves. Also, despite the
uncompromising soil, evidence of a Mole in the form of castings and heavings
was apparent along the trail.
<p> The canopy of the Hemlock-Spruce
forest is dominated by Hemlock as large or larger than four feet (1.2 meters)
dbh. The Red Spruce, although less than
half as abundant as Hemlock, are also rather large with some ranging to 28
inches (0.7 meters) or greater in dbh. 
Although Yellow Birch outnumber Black Birch, the latter is represented
by larger trees, up to 28 inches (0.7 meters) dbh or more. Other canopy species noted either in the
1992 or 1996 visits are Red and Sugar Maples, Northern Red and White Oaks,
Tuliptree, Black Cherry, White Ash, Black Gum and Beech. Of these the oaks, Tuliptree and Black Gum
in particular reach large sizes. The
spruce, except for scattered saplings, appears to be virtually confined to the
upper War Spur Branch ravine above 3500 ft (1070 meters) asl. However Hemlock, apparently free of the
Hemlock Wooly Adelgid, continues abundant and perhaps increases in importance
below this elevation, at least to the limit of our traverse to about 3400 ft
(1040 meters). At these lower
elevations only a few Spruce Saplings were seen, but Hemlock was also of large
size.
<p> Neither Hemlock nor Red Spruce
seedlings and saplings were abundant,and those of Hemlock showed signs of deer
browsing. One five foot (1.5 meter)
tall Red Spruce in partial shade showed apparent yearly height growth
increments of around three inches (8 cm) for four recent years. It was also noted that the ravine
Hemlock-Spruce forest is bordered by a sparse distribution of small spruce
saplings in the upland oak forest, which may be a consequence of fire
suppression in recent years A notable feature of the Hemlock-Spruce
forest was the great abundance of Northern Red Oak seedlings. Red Maple and Birch seedlings were also
common, with the latter almost confined to the surface of large woody debris in
openings.
<p> Mountain Holly , Striped Maple and
Serviceberry of unidentified species form an understory in the Hemlock-Spruce
forest, while the shrub layer is dominated by Great Rhododendron near the
stream. Witch Hazel (<i>Hamamelis 
virginiana </i>) , Minnie-bush
and Mountain Laurel are also common and Hobblebush (<i>Viburnum alnifolium </i> ), in autumn red, occurred in at least one
place. Common Greenbrier (<i>Smilax rotundifolia </i> ) was the only vine seen.
<p> Herbaceous ground cover in the
ravine forest is sparse. Round-leaf
Violet (<i>Viola rotundifolia </i>) , Northern White Violet (<i>Viola 
pallens </i>) , Mountain Oat
Grass (<i>Danthonia compressa </i>) , White Wood Aster (<i>Aster 
divaricatus </i>) , Mountain
Aster, Teaberry, Indian Pipe (<i>
Monotropa uniflora </i>) , Pinesap (<i>Monotropa hypopithys </i>) , the rush<i>Juncus tenuis</i>, Indian Cucumber-root, Squaw Root (<i>Conopholis 
americana </i>) , the forest
grass <i>Brachyelytrum erectum</i>, Downy
Rattlenake Plantain and Galax (<i>Galax aphylla 
</i>) were observed. Although not noticed at that time, Canada Mayflower
(<i>Mainthemum canadense </i>) was
observed as intergrowths with Galax in June 1992. Only New York, Hay-scented and Cinnamon Ferns and a little
Marginal Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris
marginalis </i>) were noted in the
upper Hemlock-Spruce forest. However , on
descending the ravine to where few spruce occur but Hemlock is abundant, there
was an abrupt appearance of
Intermediate Shield Fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia 
</i>) and this species continued very abundant to the apparent exclusion
of other ferns with farther descent along stream.
<p> Mosses are in places abundant and
diverse in the Hemlock-Spruce forest. 
Taxa observed were various unidentified species of <i>Polytrichum</i>, <i>Leucobryum</i>, <i>Hypnum</i>, <i>Mnium</i> and <i>Sphagnum</i>,<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>, <i>Dicranum
scoparium</i>, <i>Hedwigia ciliata</i> and <i>Rhodobryum
roseum</i> as, as well as the liverwort <i>Bazzania
trilobata</i>.. These bryophytes
occurred mostly on down woody debris but in some places mosses ascended to
shoulder height on trunks of trees such as Beech. In places there were intergrowths of <i>Dicranum scoparium</i> and <i>Cladina</i> 
lichens in patches on soil.
<p> The trees in the Hemlock-Spruce
forest, which is old growth primary forest, are widely spaced with a resultant
low stem density (Adams and Stephenson, 1991). 
In some places these gaps are filled by dominantly hardwood saplings or
shrub thickets. There is also much
large woody debris on the forest floor, including large, partially decayed
boles of American Chestnut.

<p><b>Summary</b>
<ul>
<p> Both the upland and ravine forests
reflect the substrate, topgraphy and elevation. Plants here are almost universally acid soil species , many with northern
or high elevation distributions. 
Examples falling in both categories are Mountain Holly, Southern
Mountain Cranberry, Thornless Blackberry, Yellow Clintonia, Canada Mayflower, Wild
Sarsaparilla , Mountain Aster, and Wild Lily of the Valley. Some acid lovers are however conspicuous by
their absence. These include Spotted
Wintergreen (<i>Chimophyla maculata 
</i>), Sourwood (<i>Oxydendrum arboreum 
</i>) and Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus florida 
</i>). All three are common at
White Rocks, which is some 600 ft (180 meters) lower in elevation. Spotted Wintergreen is seldom found above
3000 ft (910 meters) asl at this latitude and Flowering Dogwood only a little
higher. Here, as elsewhere in this belt
of transition to the Southern Appalachians, Galax seems to thrive at most
elevations. Tuliptree, a component of
the ravine forest, is not often found this high and infrequently at the elevation of White Rocks, where it is
common. Such extensions of range may
result from local factors such as greater precipitation and cloud cover
especially during the early part of the growing season.
<p> The ravine Hemlock-Spruce forest is
a good example of the acid-mesic type or one of several types of oligotropic
communities. In this case it is a
consequence of a moist siliceous substrate. 
Such forests frequently have large well-formed trees but a depauperate
ground flora as a consequence of nutrient and moisture deficiencies in the
upper soil horizons. The ravine forest
here contrasts greatly with analogous bottomland part of the Fanny Bennett
Hemlock Grove in West Virginia, which contains a rich herb flora as a result of
nutrient introduction from upstream (see <a href=fannier.htm>our section on Fanny Bennett</a>, also
Mueller, 1998). It is however not too different from that
part of Fanny Bennett which occurs on a steep sandstone slope and which does
not receive supplementary nutrients. 
Attention has previously been called to similarities between
Hemlock-Spruce stands at War Spur and at Laurel Run on Shenandoah Mountain (see our section on <a href=hall.htm>Hall Spring</a>), both of which share dominance with
Appalachian hardwoods.
<p> Another characteristic of these
infertile forests is their apparent poverty of birdlife. Although a few species such as Blue Jays (<i>Cyanocitta 
cristata</i>) and Pileated Woodpeckers (<i>Dryocopus piliatus</i> ) made themselves known along War Spur in
September, their number and variety did not compare with those observed at
White Rocks two weeks later.
<p> Considerable research has centered
on Salt Pond Mountain and vicinity. 
Adams and Stephenson (1989, 1991) and Stephenson and Adams (1991) in
particular have studied both the deciduous and coniferous forests of the area. They have shown that the soils of the Salt
Pond Mountain Hemlock-Spruce forest are very acid indeed, with pH in the range
of 3.5.
