<h1>pH of Freshly Fallen Leaves</h1>
<ul>
<p> Fallen leaves of 33
deciduous and coniferous species were collected over a two month period from October
to December 2000. A caveat here, however, is that leaves of most conifers were
taken from recently dead material on trees. Most samples were from terrain
underlain by Ordovician Beekmantown dolomitic limestone, but seven were from a
north – facing colluvial slope underlain by Cambrian Elbrook limestone (Rader,
1967). Six forest types were represented, and although most samples were from
calcareous substrates, some were from substrates developed on highly acidic
chert within the calcareous terrain (see our section on <i>Hydrastis canadensis</i> L) . The period of collection was exceptionally dry, with only a
few light rains. Thus, there is an increased probability that chemical leaching
of the leaves was minimal.
<p> All leaf samples were
shredded with the fingers and slurries formed with the fragments and rainwater.
The initial pH determinations of each sample were done after the slurry stood
for 24 hours and these were followed by others, usually after an additional 24
hours. A Hydrion Ultrafine pH Test Paper Set (Fisher) was employed. These
papers had the advantages of simplicity, small sample size and low cost. Color
matches every 0.2 – 0.3 pH units may in
principle be obtained over the range of interest here, and usually several
overlapping papers could be employed. All determinations were at room
temperature. The pH determinations were observed to be independent of the leaf
/ water ratio and the pH of the water used, as might be expected. Also, little
or no difference was noted between several pH determinations of each sample
done after either the 24 or 48 hour soaking periods or between the two period
results. Reproducibility for each 
individual sample was usually within 0.2 units.
<p> As indicated in the
table captions, 40 samples were from trees on Beekmantown dolomitic limestone.
Of these 17 were from calcareous colluvium, 10 were from ericaceous oak forest
associated with chert, 8 were from an old field 1 was from chert talus, 2 were from a calcareous flood plain
and 2 from trees that had been planted in shallow soil above limestone. To
obtain wider coverage seven samples were also collected from the north – facing
slightly acid / mesic colluvial slope on Elbrook Formation. In the following
table the leaves of the species are arranged roughly from low to high pH.

<p>Observed pH values of freshly fallen leaves of 33 species from the
Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. Forest Types represented are as follows: From
Beekmantown dolomitic limestone terrain: 1= calcareous colluvial slope, 2=
ericaceous oak forest, 3= old field, 4= calcareous flood plain, 5= chert talus,
p= planted trees. From Elbrook limestone: (1)= slightly acidic colluvium.

<p>&nbsp;
<p> In general results
meet expectations. There is a general increase in leaf pH from acid / xeric to mesic forest
type and species, with some notable exceptions. Most
striking of these exceptions is the low pH of Redbud (<i>Cercis canadensis</i>
) leaves, since this is a characteristically mesic species frequently found, as
here, on limestone. Similarly, those of 
Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum) 
lie at somewhat unexpectedly low pH, while those of American Beech, (<i>
Fagus grandifolia</i>) fall in a
higher than expected range. Although supported by few samples, there may be a
correlation between character of substrate and leaf pH. Thus the values for
Black Oak (<i>Quercus velutina</i>), 
Flowering Dogwood (<i>Cornus florida</i>
), American Beech and Tuliptree (<i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i>) are higher in samples from calcareous substrates
than from more acidic ones. Of these the planted Beech (No 36), which
occupies thin soil above limestone, is clearly unstable as distinguished from
metastable (Mueller, 2000), as indicated by its slow growth, chlorotic leaves
and general lack of vigor at this site, although it was a very vigorous
seedling at its original site on acid / mesic colluvium. It was found necessary to acidify the soil around
this tree to save it. Additionally, the other planted tree, the Black Maple (<i>
Acer nigrum</i>), had leaves with
markedly higher pH than those of either Sugar Maple, a very closely related
species. However, unlike the Beech, Black Maple is strongly calciphile (
Mueller, 2000) and thrives at this
site.
<p> As expected, the pH
values of all oak leaves are quite acid, with Scarlet oak (<i>Quercus coccinea</i>), a species confined to acid
substrates, showing the lowest values. Given the prominence of the oaks in many
forests, it is readily apparent why heavy leaf mats are associated with acid
soils However it is likely that acidification is further enhanced by the
partial decay process which leads to the raw humus layer (mor) that usually
underlies these leaf mats. In the experience of this reporter, the pH of this
raw humus as well as that of the underlying mineral soil is frequently
considerably lower than the range of most oak leaves shown in the table. While
no systematic search of the literature was made of leaf pH (the writer would
appreciate any pertinent leads to such data), a reference was found regarding
that of Sugar Maple as well as related chemical data. Thus Fowells (1965) 
provides a pH range 4.0 to 4.9 for leaves of this species, in good agreement
with values obtained in this study. These leaves were found to contain 1.81 %
Ca, 0.24 Mg and 0.25 K, and Ca was observed to drop when soil pH fell below
4.5. Additionally, the leaves of Flowering Dogwood were found to be
particularly high in calcium, with a range of 2.7 – 4.2 %, while magnesium had
values of 0.3 – 0.5% (Coile,1940; Oosting, 1942) .Also, American Basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>) leaves were found to have
the highest percentage of Ca and Mg among those of 24 hardwoods and conifers
analyzed (Fowells, 1965) . Although the &quot;species&quot; here is White Basswood, it is very close to
and even gradational to American Basswood in the area in which it is found.
This finding of high base content also is in harmony with the relatively high
pH of basswood leaves found here. While no determinations of the pH of American
Beech leaves were found in the literature, the observed relatively rapid degradation of these leaves
is compatible with values found here. Thus, these leaves not only degrade
rapidly on the ground but, if still on the tree, bleach white, behaviors quite
unlike those of the oaks.
